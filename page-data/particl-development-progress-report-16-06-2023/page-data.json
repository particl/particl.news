You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nSetup Wizard ?\nGitHub - gerlofvanek/basicswap-Installation-GUIContribute to\ngerlofvanek/basicswap-Installation-GUI development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubgerlofvanek\n[https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-Installation-GUI]Earlier today, we\nreleased a non-compiled version of BasicSwap's setup wizard to our testing\ngroup. Members can now test the wizard and provide feedback on any potential\nissues specific to their operating systems.\n\nAs we finalize the minor details for it, our next step will be to compile it\ninto an .exe launcher for Windows, along with equivalent launchers for other\noperating systems. It's important to note that the initial wizard release will\nnot include an .exe launcher to start BasicSwap after it is installed. However,\nthe inclusion of this feature is planned for a subsequent release.\n\nUser Interface ?️ \nWe've successfully resolved the majority of the bugs present in version 2.0.2 of\nthe user interface and are currently incorporating a few final additions based\non community feedback. Once these changes are implemented, we'll be ready for\nthe official release.\n\nAs highlighted in last week's report, the 2.0.2 user interface and the new setup\nwizard will be launched simultaneously.\n\nCodebase ?\nThose familiar with BasicSwap may be aware that the integration of Monero is\ncurrently partial. As it stands, you can't place offers on the order book\noffering Monero in exchange for other coins. If you possess Monero and want to\nswap it for another currency, you must choose an offer made by another user\nrequesting Monero. That's why the Monero integration may sometimes be referred\nto as working \"one way\".\n\nThis situation is a result of an inherent limitation within Monero's coin\nstructure and its adaptor signature-based swap protocol. However, we're excited\nto announce that we have begun the process of implementing our solution to this\nissue this week, ahead of our presentation at Monerokon. The fix won't be at the\nprotocol level, rather leveraging SMSG and BasicSwap's order book system.\nHowever, from the perspective of the end-user, the outcome will be seamless,\nallowing them to finally swap Monero \"both ways\" — that is, to publish offers on\nthe order book that both offer and request Monero.\n\nWhile we would greatly like to have a basic demo of our solution available by\nnext Friday, when Particl and BasicSwap developer Kewde is scheduled to present\nat Monerokon, we can't make any firm guarantee in that regard. For the time\nbeing, know that we're diligently working to make it a reality, and that we'll\nkeep you up-to-date about progress on that end.\n\nBasicSwap Presenting at Monerokon ?\nA technical conference in privacy and financial technologyA technical\nconference\nin privacy and financial technologyKonferenco2023 [https://monerokon.com/]We are\nthrilled to announce our invitation to deliver a presentation at this year's\nMonerokon conference.

This tool will facilitate the installation and eventual launching of\nthe DEX via a user-friendly interface. This advancement aligns us with the\nconvenience of a .exe type of executable, essentially enabling you to configure\nand launch BasicSwap without the need to navigate through the command line\ninterface.\n\nThe setup wizard is largely complete, but we are still refining its design and\nthe overall user journey within the GUI. Therefore, we've opted to hold the\nrelease of the v2.0.2 GUI until the setup wizard is ready.\n\nSimultaneously, we have identified and are addressing a few GUI bugs within the\n2.0.2 version of the BasicSwap user interface, and so we're fixing those at the\nsame time.\n\nCodebase ?\nWe've been adding some functions based on user feedback, notably the ability to\nprune data off of your local instance. For example, in the next update, you'll\nbe able to delete past offer and bid history (as long as they are completed).\n\nPlease bear in mind that this enhancement is primarily intended to improve user\nexperience rather than privacy. If an instance were to be scrutinized after data\ndeletion, remnants of previous swaps may still be detected. We plan to introduce\nthorough data pruning in a privacy-conscious manner in the future, as this\nrequires additional development.\n\nFurthermore, we've upgraded the core versions of the Particl and Monero\nblockchains. We highly recommend that you update them to operate the most recent\nversion.\n\nTo update your core, please follow the text-based guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nor watch our Youtube video on the topic here [https://youtu.be/dURSmAtWE6A].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
