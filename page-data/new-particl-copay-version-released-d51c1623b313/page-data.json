Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for the biggest event of the year in\ncrypto: the NYC Blockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events]. There, \nthey will finally reveal the Open Marketplace on the real Particl network, the\nmainnet, for the first time ever!\n\nAnd that Open Marketplace is not “just another marketplace”, it is a world\nfirst: a decentralized marketplace, fully autonomous and private, for a new\ncustomer and seller experience\n\nIf you don’t know about it, let us present it to you!\n\nIn this blog post, we will tell you about:\n\n * The Particl Open Marketplace\n * The NYC Blockchain Week\n * The road to the marketplace & how we got there\n * The current state of development, and more\n\nWhat’s the Particl Open Marketplace?\nSimply put, the Open Marketplace is an entirely decentralized marketplace where\nyou can buy and sell products and services to anyone else in the world, in full\nprivacy. Think Alibaba or eBay, but on the blockchain and without a company\nbeing in control of the platform. This means there is no risk of a third party\nusing its position of power to spy on you and impose its arbitrary rules and\nfees.\n\nThe marketplace is fully autonomous, meaning that it doesn’t require any\nthird-party or intermediary to function. It instead restores the balance of\npower back to the people by using a combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer\ntechnologies. The absence of intermediaries alone is enough to bring the cost of\nselling on the platform to a near-zero level.\n\nThis means both vendors and buyers end up with more money in their pockets.\nBecause vendors make more profit per sale, they can reduce their prices to\nincrease their volume and beat the competition. This, in turn, means customers\ncan potentially gain access to cheaper products!\n\nThe Particl Open Marketplace also utilizes a combination of various security\nmeasures and privacy protocols to ensure that none of your data can be accessed\nby anyone. It is a “private by default” marketplace, meaning that you don’t need\nto take any extra step in order to protect your data — it’s just the way Particl\nis.\n\nParticl at the NYC Blockchain Week\nThe NYC Blockchain Week is a series of many crypto events happening within the\nsame timeframe in New York. It attracts the biggest names in the industry,\nshowcases the best blockchain projects, and unites the many different crypto\ncommunities together for one exciting week. In a way, the NYC Blockchain Week is\nto crypto what the World Cup is to football.\n\nParticl in NYC\nParticl is, of course, going to be a part of this event. In fact, you’ll be able\nto come to meet us, right at our booth, at either Magical Crypto Conference or \nConsensus. That’s right! We’ll be having a booth at the two best conferences NYC\nBlockchain Week 2019 has to offer and we’ll be demonstrating the Particl Open\nMarketplace, in exclusivity, on mainnet!\n\nMagical Crypto Conference (MCC)—11th & 12th of May\nThe Magical Crypto Conference [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/] is a\npure crypto-community conference. It is organized and hosted by the well known\n“Magical Crypto Friends”, a group of 4 influencers in the crypto space: Charlie\nLee (Litecoin), Samson Mow (Blockstream CSO), Ricardo Spagni (Monero), and\n“WhalePanda”\n\nThis is the perfect place to meet potential Open Marketplace users and is the\nreason why we are so excited to be having a booth at this event. In fact, as MCC\nis more of a pure crypto community conference, it attracts some of the crypto\npioneers and people that are already deeply interested by the true vision of\ncryptocurrencies, privacy, decentralization, and personal freedom. A simple look\nat the speaker list [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#speakers] should\ngive you a good idea of the type of people that will attend the event.\n\nConsensus by Coindesk—13th to the 15th of May\nStarted by Coindesk in 2015, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] is one of the first crypto\nconference ever and the most prestigious. It has become the biggest\ncryptocurrency event in the world and is a place where people mean business.\n\nThis will be the ideal place to meet various people from different areas of\nexpertise — media, marketing, law, vendors, suppliers, influencers, and, of\ncourse, crypto fans. Such a varied crowd of people is sure to have a lot of\ndifferent feedback about the Open Marketplace, and we are really excited to see\nthe reaction of these people when faced with a modern blockchain product, on\nmainnet.\n\nHaving a good chunk of the team at Consensus will also be ideal to meet people,\ncraft new relationships, and grow the amount of interest for the Particl\necosystem.\n\nMeet the Team\nThe Particl team is going to be 10 member/representative strong going into these\nconferences.\n\n * Juha (Ludx) — Lead Open Marketplace Developer\n * Gerlof van Ek (Crz) — Lead Designer & Branding, UI/UX, Developer\n * Paul Schmitzer (Litebit) — Project Marketing & Strategy\n * Imran (Imyb) — Commercial & Partner Strategy\n * Cryptoguard — Communications & Strategy\n * Gloria (Katelady) — Communications & Strategy\n * Joe Fisher — eCommerce Strategy (Particl Advisor)\n * Lina Seiche — Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist\n * Desi-Rae Campbell (Cryptoramble) — Education & Awareness\n * Joskye — Education & Awareness\n\nCome to our booth at either MCC or Consensus and have a chat with us.

It is a complex combination of\npeer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy\nprotocols. It’s also never been attempted before, most of the development toward\nthe marketplace being true pioneering work. It supports a decentralized and\nprivate cryptocurrency, an entirely decentralized escrow mechanism,\ndecentralized file hosting, metadata leak prevention, and etc.\n\nTo see all of the components and features of the Open Marketplace, read our\nPrivacy in eCommerce blog post by following this link: \nhttps://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155\n\nIt has been under heavy and constant development for nearly two years. Almost\nexactly one year ago, Particl released its first proof-of-concept on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, although with a much more basic version of what it has now become. At the\ntime, a simple buy and sell flow was available, without moderation tools,\nwithout proposals, and without a user interface that’s as stable and\nuser-friendly as it is today.\n\nAll this time, throughout the cold crypto winter, the Particl team has been \nhard\nat work [https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9] to\ndeliver its long-anticipated Open Marketplace on mainnet. This much is evidenced\nnot only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on Github\n[http://github.com/particl] but by the very noticeable progress being made on\nthe Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl\nproject has found itself being ranked high in almost all development-related\nrankings of blockchain projects\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAnd here we are, in New York City, presenting the Particl Open Marketplace live\non the main network for the first time ever!\n\nWhat’s next?\nAfter 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is\nnearly over ?\n\nStarting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain,\nParticl created a first:\n\n→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is\nthought of with maximum privacy and security in mind. Everything on Particl is\nprivate, from its untraceable currency to its marketplace, without forgetting\nits proposal, escrow, messaging, file hosting systems, and more.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning, a lot will come after the release of the Open\nMarketplace on mainnet:\n\n * Advanced Open Marketplace features: secure messaging, privacy transactions,\n   inventory management, in-client package tracking, review system, fiat price\n   pegging, and etc.\n * “Marketplace Bubbles” : your own private market on the particl network!\n * CT Bulletproofs, while still being tested on the test network, will improve\n   drastically the size of privacy transactions for any trades of the network.\n   Don’t forget that Particl uses RingCT technology (on testnet), a first on the\n   Bitcoin codebase!\n * Particl Lightning Network (our first testnet transaction just happened a few\n   days ago\n   [https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n   ) and Atomic Swap, so that anyone can change its Bitcoins, Litecoins,\n   Moneros, and more on the marketplace to buy anything in the blink of an eye!\n * Developer SDK so that anyone can easily build their own decentralized\n   applications on the Particl network.\n\nWe are excited to show what true privacy in eCommerce looks like this week in\nNew York, both at MCC and Consensus conference. Although we may be extremely\nbusy during that time, we will not forget to report everything that happens here\nso that you can live these events with us. If you are there, do not hesitate to\npass at our booth to test the marketplace and get some Particl or Bitcoin\nbranded goodies.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-gZG9HtTiXDgtDcLDGYpbgQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

There, <strong>they will finally reveal the Open Marketplace</strong> on the real Particl network, the mainnet, for the first time ever!</p><p>And that Open Marketplace is not “just another marketplace”, it is a world first: a decentralized marketplace, fully autonomous and private, for a new customer and seller experience</p><p>If you don’t know about it, let us present it to you!</p><p><em>In this blog post, we will tell you about:</em></p><ul><li><em>The Particl Open Marketplace</em></li><li><em>The NYC Blockchain Week</em></li><li><em>The road to the marketplace &amp; how we got there</em></li><li><em>The current state of development, and more</em></li></ul><h2 id=\"what-s-the-particl-open-marketplace\">What’s the Particl Open Marketplace?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-Z-6VNFb1jvpmwHKDaAnDkw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Simply put, the Open Marketplace is an <strong>entirely decentralized marketplace</strong> where you can buy and sell products and services to anyone else in the world, in full privacy.

The Awareness\nCampaign’s mission is to acquire new users and kick-start the Particl economy,\nplain and simple. More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nThis campaign will run until mid-July and give you the opportunity to earn\npoints that can be redeemed against PART prizes and even lifetime staking\nshares. All you need to do to start earning points it to let your friends know\nabout Particl and get them to sign up with us!\n\nRules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community\n * Sign up with your email\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\n> Note: Signing up with us will earn you 1 point. Each friend you get to sign up\nwith us will earn you 1 additional point.\nPrize\n * 1 lifetime staking share per friend that signs up (12+ points required)\n\nBecause the payouts cap has been reached in just under 16 hours, sign up payouts\nare now complete and disabled. But don’t worry, you can still earn PART by\naccumulating staking shares. All you need to do is get more than 10 of your\nfriends to sign up with us!\n\nAfter getting 10 of your friends to sign up with Particl, each additional one\nwill reward you with 1 lifetime share of the revenue made by the Ambassador\nStaking Pool [https://stake.particl.community/].\n\nTo see the first staking share payment round of the campaign, follow this link: \nhttps://explorer.particl.io/block/e559921895d05a53025dcb84f61ea42fd0362a786d3e848e640015755ba9f0d4\n\nHow to Claim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, all you need to do is send us, by email, a private address.\nDon’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy to acquire.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
