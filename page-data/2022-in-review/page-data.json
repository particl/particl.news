What's more, in\nJune, we unveiled our new vision for the platform's infrastructure, one designed\nto be fully open, modular, and incorporate a multitude of new and cutting-edge\ncapabilities. This strategic refocus is essential in advancing Particl and\nfacilitating its adoption by a broader audience.\n\nBut before we continue to discuss what's in store for the future, let us take a\nstep back and recognize the accomplishments that have been achieved throughout\nthe year.\n\nParticl Core\nGitHub - particl/particl-core: Particl Core integration/staging treeParticl\nCore\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core]Particl Core, the platform’s\nblockchain, is precisely what its name implies; it is the backbone of the PART\ncryptocurrency and powers safe and private currency transactions using the PART\ncoin — complete with a wide range of features like private transactions,\nsmart-contracts, and advanced financial capabilities to be used in intricate\ndecentralized applications.\n\nOne important particularity of the Particl blockchain is that it is forked from\nBitcoin and is actively maintained up-to-date with all its upstream updates —\nproviding you with the assurance that your funds are secure and that the\nplatform has the necessary capabilities to provide all the modern, enhanced\nfunctionality of Bitcoin.\n\nThe significance of this cannot be overstated. By leveraging the Bitcoin\ndeveloper community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire\ntalent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github\nrankings, like CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] for example, where the\nParticl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.\n\nThis is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global\ncollective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday\nlives.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 9, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6]\n * Jan 17, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 1, 2022 — Taproot goes live on mainnet (Particl Core 0.19.2.18\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18]) *\n * Feb 8, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 24, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Apr 13, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.20\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0]\n * Apr 16, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.2.0\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0]\n * Apr 25, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.21\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10]\n * Aug 20, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.22\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0]\n * Oct 2, 2022 — Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1]\n * Nov 12, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0]\n\n* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot\nhardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.\n\nParticl Desktop\nGitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace\nand\nPART coin wallet.

It is, indeed, a\ncomprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and\ndecentralization above all else.\n\nAs such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces,\nthrough which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace.\nWithout it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like\ninterfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.\n\nThat’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides\nusers with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of\napplications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet\nmanagement, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous\norganization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand\nto include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more\nakin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.\n\nThere’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl\necosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times\nthroughout 2022.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 4, 2022 — v3.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]\n * Feb 4, 2022 — v3.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1]\n * Apr 12, 2022 — v3.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2]\n * Apr 14 2022 — v3.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3]\n * May 9, 2022 — v3.2.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0]\n * Jun 29, 2022 — v3.2.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1]\n * Jul 1, 2022 — v3.2.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]\n * Dec 24, 2022 — v3.3.0-RC001\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001] \n    (testnet ongoing) *\n\n* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into the new development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nBasicSwap DEX\nGitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of ConceptBasic Atomic\nSwap Proof of Concept. Contribute to tecnovert/basicswap development by\ncreating\nan account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap]\nPerhaps the most exciting release of the year, BasicSwap is Particl’s brand new\ndApp. Indeed, the simultaneous failure of the FTX scam exchange and the release\nof the BasicSwap DEX proved to be an opportune moment for Particl, as it brought\nconsiderable attention to the platform and its mission.\n\nIt is a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading exchange that offers a secure, private, and\ncompletely decentralized trading platform. It eliminates the need for central\npoints of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap\ncryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking\ndApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a\nmajor milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader\ncryptocurrency industry.\n\nBasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open\nbeta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for a\nvariety of coins [https://basicswapdex.com/markets] (including Monero).\n\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early\nstages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it\ntoday, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few\nminutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you\nhave enabled are synced locally on your device.\n\nBut don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and\nend-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second\nhalf of this blog post.\n\nReleases\n * Nov 30, 2022 — BasicSwap.com Website Release [https://BasicSwapDEX.com/]\n * Dec 7, 2022 — BSX Open Beta\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/]\n\nParticl Electrum\nGitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl WalletElectrum Particl Wallet.\nContribute to particl/electrum development by creating an account on GitHub.\nGitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/electrum]As part of our efforts to\nmake BasicSwap (and other Particl dApps) more easily accessible, we’ve made\nearly strides in providing more light services to the network with the release\nof Particl Electrum, a fork of Bitcoin’s Electrum wallet. It is expected to play\nan important role in the ecosystem moving forward, whether that is more of a\nback-end one or not.\n\nIndeed, being able to easily fork an open-source wallet like Electrum is one of\nthe many benefits in keeping up-to-date with Bitcoin upstream updates, as we’ve\nmentioned earlier in this blog post.\n\nBut the wallet provides much more than just light services; it is a feature-rich\nand easy-to-use cryptocurrency wallet that can be set up in just a few seconds.\nAnd as a sweet bonus, it also doubles as a mobile wallet, providing you with an\nadded layer of convenience and security you can bring with you on-the-go!\n\nReleases\n * Mar 25, 2022 — 4.2.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.3_particl]\n * Mar 30, 2022 — 4.2.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.4_particl]\n\nParticl Stories\nStories - Particl NewsLearn more about Particl’s mission, vision, and purpose\nthrough stories that expose some of the lesser-known problems that affect us\nevery day.Particl News2 Nov 2022 • 5 min read\n[https://particl.news/tag/stories/]While technical releases are important —\nafter all, they are what makes the ecosystem — it is important to understand\nthem as part of a greater whole.\n\nTo better communicate our mission, vision, and the values that motivate the\nParticl team, we’ve started sharing, from time to time, different “stories” that\ntouch on different topics relevant to Particl.\n\nThese stories provide more context to what we do, and we certainly plan on\npublishing more of these as we move forward.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have\npositioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes\nnext with you.\n\nA New Development Cycle Begins\nIt may have been a few months since we’ve announced Particl’s upcoming\ndevelopment cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], but with the\nimminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for\nit to start taking form.\n\nParticl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's\narchitecture, making it modular in design and more open to external\ncontributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:\n\n1- SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized & Private Internet Protocol\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol]\n:\n\nA major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced\nversion of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network\npowering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.\n\nThis update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and\nable to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional\nfunctionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages,\nand other types of data or content.\n\n2- A New Modular Architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension]\n:\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down\nof Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each\nother, but without depending on one another.\n\nThis will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the\noverhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether\nthey are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined\ndevelopment process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved\ninteroperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the\ncontributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or\nservices.\n\n3- Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility]\n:\n\nOne of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the\nease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could\nbe readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving\nthe exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new\naudience.\n\nBut the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate\nthird-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems,\ninto Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.\n\nThis will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with\ndecentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks,\nallowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long\nas they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.\n\nThe changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented\nlevel of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while\nmaintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position\nthe platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the\nbenefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much\nconvenience.\n\n4- Currency and Protocol Agnosticism\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism]\n:\n\nIt is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace\nthe ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain\nitself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms\nmust be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.\n\nAs such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger\ndegree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but\nalso with the protocols that can power its dApps.\n\nCurrently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG\nnetwork, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many\nways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing\nuser base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may\nbe able to provide.\n\nThis is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various\ncryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of\nprivacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as\npossible.\n\nBut don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming\ncycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other\ncryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy\nand flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized\napplications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply\nfunction.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of\napplications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their\ncreators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will\nresult in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real\nvalue to other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nCurrent Roadmap\nTo adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming\ndevelopment cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important\nmilestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the\ndeployment phase.\n\nThe foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open\narchitecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand,\ninvolves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating\nthem into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and\nservices (or variants of current ones) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be\nfully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the\ncommunity. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms,\nwhich is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all\nfronts.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in\n2023 and beyond.\n\nWith the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it\nis clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of\nthe new challenges our world faces.\n\nWe'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for\nyour passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing\nboundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for\nParticl yet!\n\nCheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world\nfor the better lies in our collective hands! ?\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

What's more, in June, we unveiled our new vision for the platform's infrastructure, one designed to be fully open, modular, and incorporate a multitude of new and cutting-edge capabilities. This strategic refocus is essential in advancing Particl and facilitating its adoption by a broader audience.</p><p>But before we continue to discuss what's in store for the future, let us take a step back and recognize the accomplishments that have been achieved throughout the year.</p><h2 id=\"particl-core\">Particl Core</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/particl-core: Particl Core integration/staging tree</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Core integration/staging tree.

By leveraging the Bitcoin developer community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire talent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github rankings, like <a href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\">CryptoMiso</a> for example, where the Particl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/akPCMt7PFFI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Particl Core — 2022 Development Progress\"></iframe></figure><p>This is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global collective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday lives.</p><h3 id=\"releases\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6\">Particl Core 0.21.2.6</a></li><li><strong>Jan 17, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 1, 2022 —</strong> <em>Taproot goes live on mainnet</em> (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18\"><em>Particl Core 0.19.2.18</em></a>) <em>*</em></li><li><strong>Feb 8, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 24, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Apr 13, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20\">Particl Core 0.19.2.20</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8\">Particl Core 0.21.2.8</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0\">Particl Core 22.0.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 16, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0\">Particl Core 23.0.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Apr 25, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9\">Particl Core 0.21.2.9</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21\">Particl Core 0.19.2.21</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10\">Particl Core 0.21.2.10</a></li><li><strong>Aug 20, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22\">Particl Core 0.19.2.22</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11\">Particl Core 0.21.2.11</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0\">Particl Core 22.0.3</a></li><li><strong>Oct 2, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1\">Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1</a></li><li><strong>Nov 12, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0\">Particl Core 23.0.3</a></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot hardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.</em></p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace and PART coin wallet.

It is, indeed, a comprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and decentralization above all else.</p><p>As such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces, through which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace. Without it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like interfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.</p><p>That’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides users with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of applications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet management, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand to include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more akin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.</p><p>There’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl ecosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times throughout 2022.</p><h3 id=\"releases-1\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">v3.1.0</a></li><li><strong>Feb 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1\">v3.1.1</a></li><li><strong>Apr 12, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2\">v3.1.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 14 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3\">v3.1.3</a></li><li><strong>May 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\">v3.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Jun 29, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1\">v3.2.1</a></li><li><strong>Jul 1, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2\">v3.2.2</a></li><li><strong>Dec 24, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001\">v3.3.0-RC001</a> <em>(testnet ongoing) *</em></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><em>the new development cycle</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id=\"basicswap-dex\">BasicSwap DEX</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept.

It eliminates the need for central points of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap cryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking dApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a major milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>BasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open beta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/markets\">a variety of coins</a> (including Monero).</p><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early stages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it today, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few minutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have positioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes next with you.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-development-cycle-begins\">A New Development Cycle Begins</h3><p>It may have been a few months since we’ve announced <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">Particl’s upcoming development cycle</a>, but with the imminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for it to start taking form.</p><p>Particl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's architecture, making it modular in design and more open to external contributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &amp; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

By leveraging the Bitcoin developer community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire talent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github rankings, like <a href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\">CryptoMiso</a> for example, where the Particl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/akPCMt7PFFI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Particl Core — 2022 Development Progress\"></iframe></figure><p>This is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global collective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday lives.</p><h3 id=\"releases\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6\">Particl Core 0.21.2.6</a></li><li><strong>Jan 17, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 1, 2022 —</strong> <em>Taproot goes live on mainnet</em> (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18\"><em>Particl Core 0.19.2.18</em></a>) <em>*</em></li><li><strong>Feb 8, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 24, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Apr 13, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20\">Particl Core 0.19.2.20</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8\">Particl Core 0.21.2.8</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0\">Particl Core 22.0.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 16, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0\">Particl Core 23.0.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Apr 25, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9\">Particl Core 0.21.2.9</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21\">Particl Core 0.19.2.21</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10\">Particl Core 0.21.2.10</a></li><li><strong>Aug 20, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22\">Particl Core 0.19.2.22</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11\">Particl Core 0.21.2.11</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0\">Particl Core 22.0.3</a></li><li><strong>Oct 2, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1\">Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1</a></li><li><strong>Nov 12, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0\">Particl Core 23.0.3</a></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot hardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.</em></p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace and PART coin wallet.

It is, indeed, a comprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and decentralization above all else.</p><p>As such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces, through which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace. Without it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like interfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.</p><p>That’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides users with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of applications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet management, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand to include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more akin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.</p><p>There’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl ecosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times throughout 2022.</p><h3 id=\"releases-1\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">v3.1.0</a></li><li><strong>Feb 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1\">v3.1.1</a></li><li><strong>Apr 12, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2\">v3.1.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 14 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3\">v3.1.3</a></li><li><strong>May 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\">v3.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Jun 29, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1\">v3.2.1</a></li><li><strong>Jul 1, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2\">v3.2.2</a></li><li><strong>Dec 24, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001\">v3.3.0-RC001</a> <em>(testnet ongoing) *</em></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><em>the new development cycle</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id=\"basicswap-dex\">BasicSwap DEX</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept.

It eliminates the need for central points of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap cryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking dApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a major milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>BasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open beta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/markets\">a variety of coins</a> (including Monero).</p><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early stages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it today, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few minutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &#x26; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

our weekly development\nprogress report! So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nOver the past week, our team has been focused on testing and executing minor\nadjustments for Particl Desktop 3.3. We have also been preparing for the\ncommencement of the upcoming development cycle and carefully assessing the most\neffective transition strategy to ensure a smooth process.\n\nWe are pleased to report that no significant issue has been found so far. As\nsuch, we are confident that the release will be ready for launch in the near\nfuture although we cannot communicate a precise mainnet release date yet.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. \n\nThis week, we have been working on a complex Bitcoin merge which has been\nrequiring a significant amount of time. \n\nAs highlighted in our yearly recap on Particl News, it is critical to maintain\nup-to-date upstream updates from Bitcoin in order to benefit from the entire\npool of talent and associated security, usability, and other improvements.\n\nThis is evident from CryptoMiso rankings [https://www.cryptomiso.com], where\nParticl Core currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed. Additionally, the\nvisualisation below shows the code updates made to Particl Core in 2022, and the\nnumber of developers working on the project, directly or indirectly. \n\nYou can monitor these changes by visiting this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week's more intricate Bitcoin merges have required a significant amount of\ntime.\n\nNonetheless, we have managed to address a few issues, particularly with the\nDocker-based configurations when executing BasicSwap in an isolated environment.\nAdditionally, we have remedied a bug that was causing the DEX to sometimes fail\nto validate the Bitcoin snapshot against its corresponding public key.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe have seen significant progress in regards to updating the user interface this\nweek. A wide array of fixes, optimizations, and enhancements have been included,\nand the offer table has been restructured to be more comprehensive and\nuser-friendly. This adds to the current ongoing tasks, which are the following:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\nWe anticipate deploying the changes shortly, allowing all users to update their\nlocal BasicSwap instances and take advantage of the new features.\n\nYear 2022 in Recap ?\n2022 in Review and What’s Coming in 2023Taking a look back at all the progress\nmade in 2022 and a glimpse of the future.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/2022-in-review/]Earlier this week, we proudly published a\ncomprehensive overview of the year 2022 and a glimpse of what's to come in 2023\nand beyond. As we reflect back on the year, it is clear that it was an\nincredibly successful one for the project and we're incredibly excited to jump\nright into 2023. \n\nWhile BasicSwap's open beta launch was a major milestone, many releases,\nincluding 16 for Particl Core, 8 for Particl Desktop, and the launch of a brand\nnew light wallet (Particl Electrum), kept the ecosystem blazing with progress\nall throughout. \n\nBut be assured, the best is yet to come and we're extremely confident for what\nstands ahead of us!

Despite the Christmas and New Year's holiday season, our team has been\nable to make decent strides in all aspects of the project. \n\nLet us review the progress we have made this week.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nParticl Desktop 3.3 Now Live on TestnetParticl Desktop 3.3 is now live on\ntestnet for community testing!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-now-live-on-testnet/]The\nlong-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.3 is now officially live on testnet as of\nthis past Sunday! \n\nWhile it mostly introduces back-end improvements, along with a few front-end\nchanges to accommodate for them, this update is necessary to lay the groundwork\nfor Particl's new development cycle, which is focused on making the project more\nmodular, open, and contributor-friendly.\n\nAs to provide more context to the above statement, the community recently posed\na question to Arnold Bansemer, Particl Desktop developer, inquiring as to\nwhether the team is considering the development of web or mobile versions of the\nmarketplace. This inquiry was prompted by the fact that the desktop version of\nthe marketplace may be perceived as too complex for consumer-level users.\n\n> \"Lite\" client is one of the deliverables intended behind the next development\ncycle. v3.3 was a necessary pre-emptive step though (...) Once the next\ndevelopment phase starts (which will be eased into after v3.3.'s release, while\nstill adding, and fixing, details to v3.3.0), things like lite clients and web\nusable wallets (while still keeping privacy preserved) and all these various UX\nrelated issues, are all intended to be addressed. — Arnold Bansemer\nIndeed, Particl's next development cycle is all about breaking down Particl's\napplications and components into open modules that facilitate greater\ncontributions and more efficient integration into user-friendly platforms. As a\nresult, the development of a web or mobile version of the marketplace, such as\nBasicSwap DEX, is a logical outcome of this major infrastructure upgrade.\n\nTo understand the scope of what this new cycle means for the project, we invite\nyou to read the following blog post carefully as it explains everything in great\ndetail: https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]Given the\nextensive changes introduced with this update, we are calling for your help to\ntest the new version and ensure that no bugs, issues, or unexpected behaviors\nappear as a result. We hope you will join us in this endeavor and help us make\nParticl the best it can be.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we have begun the process of preparing the necessary environments for\nthe development and testing of \"BasicSwap scripts\". \n\nThese scripts will provide traders and liquidity providers with the ability to\nautomate trading parameters and manage positions, resulting in a more\nuser-friendly experience with these processes.\n\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict how long it will take for these scripts\nto be ready, as it will depend on a variety of factors, such as the complexity\nof the desired features.\n\nTherefore, we are currently in the research phase, and we welcome any feedback\non which advanced trading features you would like to see implemented on\nBasicSwap DEX.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nIn regards to the user interface of BasicSwap, we're still working on the items\nenumerated our two previous weekly reports with good progress being made on all\nfronts.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
