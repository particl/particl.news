This week has been\none filled with progress, with solutions found and applied to all outstanding\nissues related to Particl V3. \n\nHowever, to ensure that the fixes work as intended, and before officially\nmarking them as fully resolved, we've decided to go ahead with one more round of\ncommunity testing that should begin within the next few days. That'll also allow\nthe team to monitor an interim solution that's been applied to the tricky ZMQ\nissue (more details further below).\n\nThis coming testnet round will be a public one, and we'll be putting extra focus\non testing the applied fixes with the specific people who've initially reported\nthem to ensure they're fixed on their environment. If no new problem arises,\nParticl V3 will then be ready for its mainnet release.\n\nLet's get down to the details of this week's report!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 Development Update Report\nGracefully Shutting Down the Marketplace\nThe MP service needed a means of gracefully shutting down. Before, the process\nsimply terminated, which could lead to potential issues in some edge cases.\n\nA solution has been found and applied. We'll be waiting for the coming testnet\nround to confirm this issue as fully resolved.\n\nChanging the ZMQ Node Library\nThis specific issue has proven quite problematic, mainly due to the ZMQ library\nitself. Since we've started working on it, many back-and-forths using different\nlibrary versions have happened and they've all produced errors one way or the\nother. Unfortunately, no out-of-the-box and fit-all solution has been found.\nBut, regardless, we have some good news to report.\n\nIn the interest of moving forward, we have opted to apply an interim solution\nthat will allow Particl V3 to be released with a user-friendly and enjoyable\nexperience for all operating systems. The interim solution is as follows.\n\nOn one hand, Linux and Mac distributions will be using a version of ZMQ (version\n6) that works perfectly on these platforms. Users of these operating systems\nwon't experience any sort of issue or negative performance impact when using\nParticl V3. ZMQ 6.0 is the optimal solution for these two platforms.\n\nOn the other hand, Windows build will leverage a different version of ZMQ\n(version 5.2.6) which maximizes the performance within what's possible. While\nnot entirely perfect, it works fine and will allow Windows users to experience\nParticl V3 with as fewer performance issues as ZMQ on Windows permits. This,\ntoo, is the optimal solution for Windows given what's available. This is more or\nless outside of our control, and we plan on fixing that issue as we move forward\n(keep reading for more details about this).\n\nBecause ZMQ 5.2.6 causes issues on other OSes, we've opted to use different\nlibrary versions depending on the OS. That means the code between builds\nintended for Windows and those intended for Mac/Linux will be slightly\ndifferent, which is not ideal development-wise but allows us to release Particl\nV3. As a more elegant solution, we are considering forking the ZMQ library and\ntweaking it according to our specific needs. That would ultimately provide a\nsingle solution that works across the board, but it might lead to slightly more\nmaintenance requirements until a fix for Windows appears \"upstream\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)]\". We will\ninvestigate this potential solution as we move forward.\n\nWe will be monitoring the results of the interim solution during the coming\ntestnet round and will report back if there's any change to this proposed\ntemporary solution. \n\n> Note: Not all Windows environments experience performance issues with ZMQ. Some\nWindows users will never experience any issue. For those users working within a\nWindows environment that causes performance issues with ZMQ, most of the\nproblems happen while the blockchain syncs. The issues tend to noticeably reduce\nin scope post-syncing.\nListing Template Hashes Not Properly Saved Under Specific Circumstances\nThere was an issue that could occur under a specific set of circumstances where\nthe posting of a template removed its hash, leading to problems with accepting\nbids.\n\nThis item is likely fixed now, but just like the previous two items, we want to\nwait for the results of the coming testnet round before officially marking this\none as fully resolved.\n\nParticl Core Development Update Report\nImproved Cold Staking Zap Feature Now Integrated Into Particl V3\nThe improved zap feature mentioned in last week's progress report has now been\nintegrated into the new Particl V3 build and will be available for testing\nduring the coming testnet round. \n\nWe highly encourage you to test it out and, as always, do your best to try to\nbreak it! \n\nParticl Core Merging\nAs usual, Particl Core has received many merges and updates to keep its code\nup-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. This is an ever-ongoing task that\nneeds to receive constant attention.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we near the mainnet release of Particl V3, we encourage you to test the\nupcoming testnet build and see if you can find any issue with it. \n\nFinding bugs, unexpected behaviors, and areas of improvements during testnet\nhelps straighten up Particl V3 for its mainnet release and vastly improves the\nfirst impression new users get when they first get their hands on it. While bug\ndiscovery may delay mainnet releases, they are vital in keeping Particl secure\nand appealing.\n\nAs always, we thank you all for your support and dedication. You are what makes\nParticl possible, and the entire Particl team is incredibly grateful!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It adds the ability for wallets to receive from\nnon-account linked extkey chains. It can be used when restoring a coldstaking\nwallet from a mnemonic and re-adding the same coldstaking-changeaddress extkey. \n\nUsually, as the added extkey is external to the wallet, its spends would not be\ndetected. This means the restored wallet would reuse keys from the start of that\nchain for any newly created transactions.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
