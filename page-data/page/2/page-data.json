series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n, we touched on the progressive evolution of atomic swap technology, bringing us\nall the way to a comprehensive atomic swap-based DEX framework that is able to\nsupport coins with no scripting language support, such as Part(Anon) and XMR.\nThis, of course, plays towards our eventual goal to integrate the BasicSwap\nprotocol into other access gateways, most notably a web-based DEX and a\nseamlessly integrated Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] \nintegration, in an ongoing effort to bring truly decentralized, private\ne-commerce to the widest audience possible.\n\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol already boasts a wide array of different coins,\neach with their own advantages and communities, two big pieces are still being\nconsidered for integration into BSX: stablecoins, and the extremely popular\nEthereum ecosystem. Of course, being able to integrate the latter would\nimmediately make the integration of a number of stablecoins trivial, as many\nstablecoins already exist as ETH tokens.\n\nThese are some thoughts on what a PART(Anon)-ETH and XMR-ETH swap integration\ninto a comprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap could look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Existing XMR-ETH Swap\n\nPeople who had the pleasure to witness Elizabeth Bink [https://github.com/noot]\n’s Monerotopia presentation on XMR-ETH swaps may have developed a curiosity\ntowards hyper-private Ethereum swaps and what they entail, perhaps most\nimportantly in the hopes of facilitating untraceable, decentralized swaps\nbetween privacy coins and stablecoins (or simply ETH itself).\n\nElizabeth and the open source project AthanorLabs\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] achieved the first XMR-ETH atomic\nswap earlier this year, and presented it to the world at the Monerotopia\nconference in Mexico City, on May 6th. Using their own breakthrough protocol,\nAthanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring\nto the table, to achieve for the first time a bona fide atomic swap between the\ntwo currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations\nto integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap\nworks and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly\nmore interesting for our purposes.\n\nUnder The Hood\nXMR, of course, and as we’ve discussed at length\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic HTLC swap\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], where both coins need some\nbasic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.\n\nETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people\nfamiliar with the semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4] \nthat the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that\nthe “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nAs it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless\nadaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of\ntoday fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is\nthat Ethereum is account-based\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/], and not UTXO-based.\n\nThe Challenges of an Account-based Architecture\nIn short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to\ndecrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account\nbalance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based\ntransaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique nonce\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp]. To that end, the nonce is\npublicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that\nthe same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.\n\nThis breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires\nrefund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a\ntransaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could\nthen send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and\nwhen the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed\ntransaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).\n\nPre-signing in adaptor signature swapsAthanorLab's solution is to make use of\nEthereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the\nswap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless\n- but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the\nnecessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by\nthe powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC\n(where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than\nadaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the\nside without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other\ntransaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the\ntransaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even\nwith sophisticated chain analysis tools.\n\nSo, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal\nlogic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds —\nincluding Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both\ninadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a\nfull integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.\n\nA snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG networkCurrent\nProtocol Limitations\nAn important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is\nthat ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in.\nThat means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only\none side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. \n\nThe RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund\nin case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks\nfirst, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder\nlocks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked\nforever. This means that the swap itself always has to be structured in one way,\nwith XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at\nthe protocol level.\n\nAnother underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even\nadvertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the\nEthereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided\nfor by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another\nreason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder\nto lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could\neasily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or\nmultiple offers, and back out.\n\nThis unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's\nparameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective\nquantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have\nlittle say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the\npreferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. \n\nAthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interfaceLooking Ahead\nMuch like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, BasicSwap's intention is to leverage\nthe SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed\nXMR-ETH swap protocol.\n\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nRemember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps\ndidn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic\nswap protocol. Instead, we leveraged the SMSG network to simulate offers\nfeaturing Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless protocol — hence,\nat the protocol level, the swap remains unidirectional. However, by integrating\nan additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network\n— we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround, essentially providing the \nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap, it is entirely seamless for the end user\nand doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nThis is all very exciting — the presence of ETH tokens would certainly prove a\npowerful addition to the BasicSwap ecosystem, and eventually to the Particl\nMarketplace, as it would open decentralized commerce to the entire Ethereum\necosystem. Furthermore, although a lot of work and testing are still ahead\nbefore this becomes a reality, the unique interaction of atomic swaps and\nBasicSwap's decentralized orderbook could once again prove to be key in\nachieving bidirectional swaps for a semi-scriptless protocol with substantial\nlimitations.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you wish to look into the ETH-XMR Atomic Swap protocol in more technical\ndetail, you can check out the project's Github\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap]\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] or join their Element room\n[https://matrix.to/#/#ethxmrswap:matrix.org]. \n\nThe protocol is still in its early phases, having been out to the public for\nslightly more than 3 months, and they would certainly welcome knowledgeable beta\ntesters and people willing to contribute end relays to this ongoing experiment!\nThe project is open source and at the forefront of atomic swap technology, and\nevery little bit helps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their\nhistory, make sure to give these articles a read!\n\n * Atomic Swap Style Showdown [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 2\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

For that reason, the classic <a href=\"https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/\">HTLC swap</a>, where both coins need some basic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.</p><p>ETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people familiar with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4\">semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol</a> that the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that the “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as always, the devil is in the details.</p><p>As it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless adaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of today fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is that Ethereum is <strong><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/\">account-based</a>,</strong> and not UTXO-based.</p><h3 id=\"the-challenges-of-an-account-based-architecture\">The Challenges of an Account-based Architecture</h3><p>In short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to decrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account balance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based transaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp\">nonce</a>. To that end, the nonce is publicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that the same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.</p><p>This breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires refund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a transaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could then send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and when the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed transaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QKqxfInsv6MoLt4G8DYAoCb0HYjFjci3sschANKgkLhq-6U4UyxOUNaC-xraWSls-jEZgGP1wZXpS3gHDtXtQM10K0KGfaHUdjGzFHXRxnBSaAA0e8gOcAjZe8wEKWz7rEYkLCOrsrsmmupTk7-O4k8\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Pre-signing in adaptor signature swaps</em></figcaption></figure><p>AthanorLab's solution is to make use of Ethereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the swap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless - but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the necessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by the powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.</p><p>Privacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC (where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than adaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the side without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other transaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the transaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even with sophisticated chain analysis tools.</p><p>So, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal logic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds — including Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both inadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a full integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-13.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-13.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-13.png 1394w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em>A snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG network</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"current-protocol-limitations\">Current Protocol Limitations</h3><p>An important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is that ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in. That means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only one side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. </p><p>The RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund in case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks first, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder locks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked forever. This means that <strong>the swap itself always has to be structured in one way</strong>, with XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at the protocol level.</p><p>Another underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even advertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the Ethereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided for by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another reason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder to lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could easily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or multiple offers, and back out.</p><p>This unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate.

Since then, we've made substantial\nstrides across all aspects of the Particl ecosystem, particularly in regards to\nBasicSwap DEX, our latest privacy-first and pro-liberty dApp.\n\nHere's a snapshot of our accomplishments and noteworthy news since the\ninitiation of the third funding cycle.\n\n * Publication of Particl’s whitepaper (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/])\n * Launch of BasicSwap’s open beta (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/])\n * Multiple subsequent BasicSwap GUI updates (1\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-available/], 2\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-0-1-available/], 3\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/])\n * Deployment of rudimentary BSX liquidity and market making tool (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/])\n * Particl Desktop 3.3 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-mainnet/] and \n   3.3.1 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-1-now-available/]\n * 9 Particl Core releases (1 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]\n   , 2 [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Core 25.x latest version (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-core-25rc1-released/])\n * Attended and gave presentations at Monerotopia\n   [https://staging.particl.news/basicswap-monerotopia-presentation/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-goes-to-monerotopia/] and Monerokon\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-talk-at-monerokon/]\n * New BasicSwap.com [https://basicswap.com] website and upcoming Particl.io\n   [https://particl.io] revamp\n * Breakthrough bidirectional Monero atomic swaps (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n   )\n * PART added to the mobile Stack Wallet (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/])\n * Particl blockchain’s yearly coin emission rate reduced (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/part-coin-emission-rate-reduced/])\n\nItems in Progress and Current Main Priorities\nIn addition to the aforementioned completed milestones, we’re currently actively\nworking on a couple of major items that align with Particl's ultimate vision.\nOur objective is to complete or make major progress on these during the\nforthcoming funding cycle while simultaneously working on various smaller\ndeliverables.\n\n * Getting PART listed on better exchanges to ease access into the ecosystem and\n   improve general market health\n * Web framework and integration layer for BasicSwap DEX and Particl Marketplace\n * Seller app (Particl Marketplace)\n * Messaging layer agnosticism for BasicSwap DEX\n * New coin integrations into BasicSwap\n * SMSG 2.0 (still in research phase, not in active development)\n\n> Note: Just like any roadmap or medium-term planning, modifications to our plans\nmay occur due to a variety of factors, such as, among others, emerging\nopportunities and changes in funding scenarios or team composition adjustments.\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 12 months\n\nThis funding request proposes a monthly claim of 35,250 PART from the Treasury\nFund for a 12-month period to support the Particl team and fund its operations.\nFollowing the end of this period, the proposal will need to be renewed and\nreceive the approval of Particl stakeholders once again to claim further funds.\n\nAs with the previous proposal, the team has chosen to claim funds for an entire\nyear to ensure steady support for current endeavors and ease the logistics\nassociated with potential external funding possibilities and hiring processes.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to enhance the\necosystem and its dApps. An example of such endeavour was Particl's recent\nparticipation at both Monerotopia and Monerokon a few months ago.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nRegarding External Funding\nThe Particl team is exploring several external funding options and is\ncontinuously assessing various proposals we receive related to third-party\nmarket liquidity or capital injections. This aims to supplement the funds drawn\nfrom the network's treasury by either providing non-PART funds to the team or\nbuilding a healthier PART landscape and a more liquid market environment for\neveryone.\n\nWhile we remain flexible and open to innovative solutions in this aspect, we are\nacutely aware of any potential impacts such initiatives could have on the\nproject, market, and community. Thus, we're taking a cautious and deliberate\napproach, and cannot provide any guarantees regarding the outcomes of these\ninitiatives if none ultimately prove beneficial to the project and its\ncommunity.\n\n> Note: This proposal has been created under the assumption that no external funds\nwill be raised, and it is sufficient to cover the team’s fundamental ongoing\nexpenses\nHow to Vote\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running the latest version of\nPartyman.

in May 2023, we traveled to Mexico City as the BasicSwap team to attend\nMonerotopia 2023. For this edition of the Monero-centric conference, they've\ndecided to welcome various privacy-focused cryptocurrency and blockchain\nprojects. There, we not only hosted a booth and forged valuable connections, but\nalso presented, on the event's main stage, BasicSwap DEX, its mission, story,\nand role within the broader privacy subset of the cryptocurrency economy.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce that the presentation is now officially\navailable on MoneroTalk's Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/@MoneroTalk/videos], and that you can finally watch it\nfrom home!\n\nTry BasicSwap DEX Today\nBasicSwap DEX's open beta is live and you can use it today! All you need to do\nis follow the instructions either on its section of the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html]\n, or from the Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEZ-a00uSM&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfxAswJnqlh_KbHvWCUFqFVF]\n.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's Order BookWhat Happened Since This Presentation\nSince this presentation, we've been hard at work improving BasicSwap's core tech\nand elevating its user experience. \n\nFirstly, we've introduced a basic liquidity providing / market making tool\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/] that anyone can deploy and\noperate from home. While it falls short of any advanced feature, such as what\nwould be possible via something like a Hummingbot integration, it enables more\nautomated and logic-based management of your liquidity and offers. Of course, we\nplan on much more all-emcompassing solutions moving forward; this is merely the\nfirst initial step towards more comprehensive solutions in the future.\n\nWe've also pursued our work on implementing a series of user interface\nimprovements [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/],\nsimplifying and refining the end-user experience. These updates have also\nsignificantly streamlined the code, enhancing the app's efficiency.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most notably since the Monerotopia presentation, we've\nadded the long-awaited bidirectional atomic swap functionality for Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. As explained in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, Monero atomic swaps, despite their groundbreaking nature, were previously\nlimited by a significant technical constraint: offers could only request Monero,\nnot offer it for other cryptocurrencies, leading to a 'one-way swapping only'\nscenario.\n\nOur latest update addresses this limitation, enabling 'two-way' Monero swapping \nor, in other words, allowing you to offer Monero when creating swap offers on\nBasicSwap's order book. While this clever workaround, made possible by the SMSG\nnetwork, doesn't resolve the technical limitation at the protocol level, it does\nso at the end-user level, making the user experience seamless with no additional\nsteps, fees, or encumbrances.\n\nThis development positions atomic swap-based Monero DEXs like BasicSwap as a\nviable alternative to data-hungry and oftentimes straight up irresponsible\ncentralized exchanges. It significantly enhances the resilience of Monero and\nPART (Anon) to external attacks and censorship campaigns.\n\nWhat's Next for BasicSwap DEX? \nWith the successful launch of the major bidirectional Monero atomic swap update,\nour attention, in regards to BasicSwap, is now concentrated on three key areas.\n\nFirstly, we are actively exploring the addition of more cryptocurrencies to the\nplatform. Though we've had to postpone this expansion to prioritize core aspects\nof the DEX, the demand for new additions has remained strong, with many requests\noriginating directly from representatives of projects seeking to be included on\nour platform. Therefore, we are now assessing the integration feasibility of\nseveral coins and hope to add a few of them in the coming weeks, alongside our\nongoing work on other areas.\n\nSecondly, we are in the process of developing a web framework that will enable\nBasicSwap-powered web services to be easily accessed through a web browser. For\nexample, envision web-based exchanges akin to Changelly or ChangeNow, but driven\nby a completely decentralized exchange protocol (BasicSwap). This significant\nadvancement is crucial in making BasicSwap DEX accessible to the wider crypto\ncommunity, including those with less technical expertise. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of this web framework will allow integrations with various\napplications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr.\nKap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl\nMarketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during\ncheckout, while still settling the transaction in PART. This is but one example\nof what can be possible with a web framework built for integrations.\n\nLastly, we are committed to enhancing BasicSwap's scalability. We are\nconsidering two potential solutions for this. The first involves creating what\nwe have temporarily named \"SMSG 2.0\". Although referred to as 2.0, this\ninitiative actually requires constructing a new SMSG-like mixnet from the ground\nup, designed for near-infinite scalability. Though we have a design and some\ninitial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand\nsignificant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative\nmixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of\nincorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap. Depending on the daily\nusage of BasicSwap, a balancing system could distribute the messaging load\nacross all integrated mixnets, thus ensuring the DEX's scalability for early but\nsubstantial adoption.\n\nAnd while we believe strongly in the scalability potential of SMSG 2.0, the\nsystem balancing messaging load across multiple mixnets might remain even after\nits readiness, if it proves effective, as it may further bolster the resiliency\nand decentralization of the DEX.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOf course, the elements we are currently focusing on, including the integration\nof more complex cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap, are substantial and will\nrequire time to fully develop. However, these efforts are paramount to realizing\nour vision of a seamlessly interconnected, privacy-first, and pro-liberty\ndigital economy. Equally important is making this economy as accessible as\npossible, to ensure that it can be embraced by a wide audience.\n\nOnce implemented, these three significant advancements will position BasicSwap\nDEX to challenge traditional centralized exchanges and catalyze the broader\nadoption of a crypto economy that's truly independent of the legacy \"fiat\nsystem\".\n\nIn the interim, we invite you to support BasicSwap by testing its capabilities,\nsharing feedback and comments with us, and adding liquidity to the order book.\nEvery contribution, regardless of its size, plays a vital role in building the\nbrighter future we all strive to achieve.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Moreover, the development of this web framework will allow integrations with various applications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr. Kap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl Marketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during checkout, while still settling the transaction in PART. This is but one example of what can be possible with a web framework built for integrations.</p><p>Lastly, we are committed to <strong>enhancing BasicSwap's scalability</strong>. We are considering two potential solutions for this. The first involves creating what we have temporarily named \"<strong>SMSG 2.0</strong>\". Although referred to as 2.0, this initiative actually requires constructing a new SMSG-like mixnet from the ground up, designed for near-infinite scalability. Though we have a design and some initial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand significant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative mixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of incorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap.

the inception of Monero atomic swaps — largely due to Joel Gugger’s\nadaption of adaptor signature-based swaps for Monero (as we’ve detailed here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n) — they have only been unidirectional, meaning it’s only been possible to buy\nor sell Monero as the 'taker' of a swap offer, never as the initiator. This is\ndue to certain technological constraints behind the semi-scriptless adaptor\nsignature scheme that is required for XMR swaps.\n\nToday, we’re extremely proud to announce the implementation of bi-directional\nMonero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps on BasicSwap DEX, meaning swaps can now be\nfacilitated in both directions.\n\nIn this blog post, we will delve deeper into the significance of this\nachievement, the methodology used to accomplish it, and its impact on the\npreservation of our privacy and liberties moving forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * Why are Bidirectional Swaps Significant?\n * Brief History of Monero Atomic Swaps\n * The Big Caveat with PART(Anon) and XMR Atomic Swaps\n * Bidirectional PART(Anon) and XMR Swaps Are Here!\n * How was it Accomplished?\n * Leveraging the SMSG Network\n * Simulating Offers Requesting Part (Anon) and XMR\n * Technical Documentation\n * How to Use\n * What Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\n * Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\n * The Road Ahead\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy are Bidirectional Swaps Significant?\nTo fully comprehend the significance of bidirectional adaptor signature atomic\nswaps, it's essential to first explore the historical development and\nfunctionality of conventional, unidirectional semi-scriptless swaps.\n\nBrief History of Monero Atomic Swaps\nAs we outlined in a recent blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, atomic swaps have long-been available to the general public ever since the\nadvent of basic HTLC-based atomic swaps, a technology that was first\nimplemented\nby the Decred team [https://github.com/decred/atomicswap].\n\nSimplied flow chart for an HTLC atomic swapHTLC swaps permit the free and\ntrustless exchange of digital assets between two parties. However, they\nnecessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have\nprogrammable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for\na wide array of coins, but not for Monero.\n\nAs the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important\nfor BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of\nfinancial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital\ncash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom\nactors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.\n\nThat’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed a\nnew Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf]. This breakthrough development, a\nproduct of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years,\nfinally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without\nthe need for programmable outputs.\n\n> Note: For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our\nrecent blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n.\nThe Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps\nWhile the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a\nsignificant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only\noperate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an\natomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer'\nand a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).\n\nThe offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap\nrequest, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder,\nin contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon\nagreement, initiates the swap process.\n\nThe offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested\ncoins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other\nparameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are\nnot specifically pertinent to this article's context.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's order bookDue to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless\natomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more\naccurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This\nstipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable\noutputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being\noffered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.\n\nTo better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which\ndescribes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from\nthe perspective of the 'offerer'.\n\nSee flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\nNote that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin —\na Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the\nMonero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a\nMonero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold\nMonero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else\nrequesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you\nmust create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.\n\nThis restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and\nadds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard\nfunctionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized\ntrading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact\nrate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a\nsolution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages\nenjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.\n\nBidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?\nWe are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero\natomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and\naccessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on\nMonero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request\nAND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.\n\nHow was it Accomplished?\nMonero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct\nconsequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting\ncapabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.\n\nAs such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or\nmaking extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic\nswap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and\ntransaction size management, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements]\n).\n\nInstead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the SMSG\nnetwork\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nwith a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a\nDEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and\nmore accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges.\nTherefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.\n\nLeveraging the SMSG Network\nOn BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order\nbook, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate\nan offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the\nmaker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHowever, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology,\nas we've outlined in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before]\n, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a\ndecentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see \nthis article\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nfor more information on SMSG).\n\nThe SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making\nBasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the\nkey to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.\n\nSimulating Offers Requesting Monero\nOur solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on\nmodifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol.\nInstead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.\n\nIn reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature\nprotocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional.\nHowever, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process —\npowered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be\noffered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the\nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end\nuser and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nRefer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier\nin this article.

Now, in contrast to the previous setup where Monero could only be\nchosen as the requested coin, you also have the option to offer it when placing\na new offer on the order book.\n\nThere are no extra steps or additional prerequisites involved. However, remember\nthat this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with\nsome additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're\nrequesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just\nlike any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. \n\nTo benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure\nthat your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version. To\ninstall it, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image.\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command.\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build command.\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nIf you're not using the Docker setup, you can follow the Particl Academy's\nstep-by-step update guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nWhat Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\nThe introduction of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps for all symbolizes a\nmonumental step towards establishing a privacy-first, resilient global economy\nthat is fair to all.\n\nIndeed, we've observed a steady increase in aggressive, restrictive measures\ntargeting privacy coins like Particl and Monero in recent years, a trend that\nhas only accelerated in recent weeks. As evidenced by the removal of the\ncryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the\naccessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals\nworldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are\nbeing enforced is only likely to speed up over time.\n\nFurthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial\ncryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or,\nat the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the\nworld, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as\nBasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that\ncryptocurrencies like Monero and truly decentralized and self-custodial\nsolutions like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various\nglobal regulations, are needed.\n\nDecentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\nFortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate\nentirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed\nand serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's\nwidespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its\nsurvival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.\n\nHowever, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing\nchallenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has\nresulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular\ncryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor\nsignature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to\nexecute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant\nbarrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.\n\nThe integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX\nmarks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance\nof today's announcement.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nOf course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance,\nBasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains\nrelatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process\nwith the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher,\nthe resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized\nexchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.\n\nThis fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that\nwill equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading\nplatforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness\nBasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without\nhaving to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web\nwallets.\n\nWhile this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of\nbidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for\nthe development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime\nfocus moving forward.\n\nWe encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at Particl News\n[https://particl.news] for updates on this topic.

This swap type is available for a wide array of coins, but not for Monero.</p><p>As the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important for BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of financial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital cash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom actors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.</p><p>That’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed <strong><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf\">a new Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures</a></strong>. This breakthrough development, a product of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years, finally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without the need for programmable outputs.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our recent blog post on the topic <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">here</a></strong>.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-big-caveat-to-monero-atomic-swaps\">The Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2><p>While the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a significant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only operate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit.

However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article.

However, they necessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have programmable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for a wide array of coins, but not for Monero.</p><p>As the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important for BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of financial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital cash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom actors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.</p><p>That’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed <strong><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf\">a new Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures</a></strong>. This breakthrough development, a product of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years, finally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without the need for programmable outputs.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our recent blog post on the topic <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">here</a></strong>.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-big-caveat-to-monero-atomic-swaps\">The Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2><p>While the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a significant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only operate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This stipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable outputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being offered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.</p><p>To better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which describes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from the perspective of the 'offerer'.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-4.png 1264w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Note that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin — a Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the Monero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness BasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without having to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web wallets.</p><p>While this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for the development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime focus moving forward.</p><p>We encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a></strong> for updates on this topic.

To\nthat end, it can be stated that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized\nand potentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the previous installment\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n\nof this series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, we discussed the history and development of atomic swap technologies, and the\ntechnical peculiarities and challenges of integrating them within a\ncomprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap DEX. Similar challenges are also\npresent in bringing the BasicSwap protocol towards web accessibility, which we\nwill explore in this article.\n\nA Foundation for Private and Accessible DEX Environments\nBasicSwapDEXMeet BasicSwap, the privacy-first and cross-chain DEX. Swap coins\nlike Bitcoin and Monero on a trading platform that’s free, unstoppable, and\nconfidential. By the Particl Project.BasicSwapDEX [https://basicswapdex.com/]\nThose familiar with the early beta of the BasicSwap protocol\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/] understand that,\nwhile the technology is incredibly powerful and allows for probably the easiest\nXMR-BTC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE] or\nPart(ANON)-BTC decentralized swaps available anywhere\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE], it is at the cost of a relatively\ninvolved process. For example, unless you wish to swap a coin pair which\nblockchains you have already downloaded, the time necessary to get a new\nblockchain up to speed can be impractical for many users. Furthermore, simply\naccessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and\nattention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for\nmany.\n\nThankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably a more\nstraightforward and less complicated install process\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-] \n— are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but\nparticularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on\nthe BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the\nBasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror\nto the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users\nto connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light\nservices or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have\nto pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third\nparties involved at any point.\n\nIn addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap\napplication already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important\nfeature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of\nadditional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current\ndevelopment focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized HTLC and Adaptor Sig\nswaps [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] available on the BSX\nnetwork. \n\nThe goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a\nplug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps,\nwhich addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on\nthe other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience\nthat characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.\n\nOur Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways\n\nTo honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap\nprotocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.\n\nFirst of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with\nregards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some\nof the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must\nkeep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from\nthe convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general\ntransparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses,\nsmart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and\npeer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.\n\nA second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based\nBasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web\nusers to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order\nbook, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private\norder books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end,\ninvesting development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and\nincentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be\ninstrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based\nDEX.\n\nThirdly, continuing our commitment to modular software architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] will ensure the\nexceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform\nvia the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG\nnetwork (1\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/])\nin the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high\nexpectations of BasicSwap DEX. This design philosophy also makes the platform\nmore scalable, both at the gateway level and at the protocol level.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeveloping the Economy of Tomorrow\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol itself is still in beta and that many of the\nnecessary building blocks towards a smooth, user-friendly atomic swap web DEX\nare still in the works, behind-the-scenes development of BasicSwap is going\nsplendidly, and a working beta of such a revolutionary web-based exchange\nplatform is well in progress.

For example, unless you wish to swap a coin pair which blockchains you have already downloaded, the time necessary to get a new blockchain up to speed can be impractical for many users. Furthermore, simply accessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and attention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for many.</p><p>Thankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-\">a more straightforward and less complicated install process</a> — are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but particularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on the BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the BasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror to the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users to connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light services or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have to pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third parties involved at any point.</p><p>In addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap application already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important feature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of additional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current development focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized <a href=\"https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/\">HTLC and Adaptor Sig swaps</a> available on the BSX network. </p><p>The goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a plug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps, which addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on the other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience that characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.</p><h2 id=\"our-vision-for-basicswap-s-access-gateways\">Our Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways</h2><p><br>To honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap protocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.</p><p>First of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with regards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some of the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must keep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from the convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general transparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses, smart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and peer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.</p><p>A second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based BasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web users to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order book, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private order books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end, investing development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and incentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be instrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based DEX.</p><p>Thirdly, continuing <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">our commitment to modular software architecture</a> will ensure the exceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform via the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG network (<a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">2</a>) in the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high expectations of BasicSwap DEX.

increasingly attractive\nalternative to centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency trades. The spectacular\nfailures of some centralized exchanges, like the Celsius debacle or last\nwinter’s implosion of the FTX exchange where billions of dollars of customer’s\nfunds were stolen obviously does nothing to help this climate.\n\nThere is, at the heart of the CEX vs DEX dynamic, a fundamental divide; while\nbig centralized entities suit traditional market logic, and can adapt these\nprinciples to fuel their own growth, they go against the fundamental principle\nof blockchain and cryptocurrency itself: private, peer-to-peer money.\n\nA Path Ahead\nIt could be argued that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized,\npotentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies. They are, of course,\nextremely resilient — as long as the blockchain accepts your transaction and you\nhave a reliable, hopefully private way to communicate with the other person, you\ncan swap. This, in effect, makes them exactly as decentralized as the\nblockchains involved. It also opens the door to entirely eliminating trust from\nthe process, unlike centralized models where you have to trust entities such as\nBinance, Celsius or FTX, and give them full control of your keys.\n\nIt was the Decred team who first made this technology a practical reality\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], with their implementation of the first\nHTLC-based atomic swaps. At their core, HTLC swaps are easy to understand. They\ninvolve 'Hashed Timelock Contracts', which are types of smart contracts, on both\nthe buyer and seller sides. This means that both blockchains must have Timelock\nand Hashlock capabilities.\n\nBesides this limiting requirement, the HTLC swap also lacks privacy. While it\nallows for trustless, atomic swap exchanges to exist, it also creates a new\nproblem with it: when making a swap, a secret is created, hashed out, and\ninscribed, minutes apart, in the blockchains of both participating blockchains.\nThe problem here is that while this allows the protocol to verify the\ntransaction and move through the next steps of a swap, it also makes it trivial\nfor outside observers to infer the two participants of a swap, as well as what\namount of money is being exchanged. Here, an important privacy issue must be\naddressed.\n\nPoint Time Locked Contract Swaps and Adaptor Signatures\nAn important stepping stone to making atomic swaps the trustless, decentralized\nand hyper-private powerhouse that it can be lays in adaptor signatures.\n\nAs we explored in this piece [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/],\nthe adaptor signature atomic swap scheme, otherwise referable to as \"Point Time\nLocked Contract (PTLC) swaps, begins with Andrew Poelstra’s work on scriptless\nscripts. Poelstra’s work was born out of necessity to interact with\nMimbleWimble, an extremely rigid blockchain protocol. These scriptless scripts\nexploit the linear nature of Schnorr signatures\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-schnorr-signatures]: by\nusing Schnorr signatures in clever ways that are expanded further in this\narticle [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], or in greater\ntechnical detail here [https://hongchao.me/scriptless-script/].\n\nPoelstra’s work, in any case, makes it possible to replicate certain smart\ncontract capabilities without needing any of the actual smart contract language\na given coin may have. The adaptor signature swap, as such, is an example of a\nscriptless script.\n\nHowever, and this is important, Bitcoin and Monero do not use Schnorr signatures\nin its cryptographic signature algorithm — instead, they use a classic Elliptic\nCurve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA. There are a lot of differences\nbetween the two that we will not get into today, but suffice to say, adaptor\nsignature swaps on blockchain protocols using ECDSA curves, like Particl's PART,\nwould fall under the category of \"semi-scriptless protocols\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-on-ecdsa-cac148dfa3ad]\".\n\nThere is a huge benefit here compared to HTLC swaps, other than the fact that it\nenables PART's anon transaction type and other RingCT coins such as XMR to be\natomically swapped: they do not rely on identical hashes that need to be\ninscribed on the participating blockchains.\n\nOf course, in the case of RingCT based coins, that wouldn’t be much of a problem\neven if we were able to swap them using traditional HTLC swaps — which, again,\nis not possible on ECDSA schemes — because the hashes would be completely\nhidden.\n\nBut the beautiful thing here is that adaptor signature swaps can actually apply\nto a vast number of cryptocurrencies, and at the same time, make the swaps much,\nmuch more private.\n\nPre-Signed Transactions\nAn important aspect to the adaptor signature swap scheme is the use of\npre-signed refund transactions to solve the inherent problem of incomplete\nswaps, and achieve trustless, infallible atomic swaps while operating within the\nconfines of semi-scriptless protocols.\n\nPre-signing the refund transaction, addressing the XMR-BTC unhappy path problem.\nLet’s take a look at an atomic swap where Alice tries to swap 1 BTC with Bob for\n1 XMR. The first thing they do is pre-sign the refund transactions for Bitcoin.\nThis can be compared to signing the divorce papers before you get married. This\nallows them to split amicably even if one disappears and leaves the other\nstranded. Now at that very moment in time, the refund transaction is useless\nbecause they haven't deposited any money — much like you cannot file a divorce\nif you’ve never gotten married in the first place.\n\nThis is mandatory to making adaptor signature based swaps a functional reality\nin the real world, as any widespread implementations needs to account for\nincomplete swaps, interrupted flows, and other \"unhappy\" paths.\n\nAdditional Privacy and Scalability Improvements\nDuring the implementation of adaptor signature-based swaps into the BasicSwap\nDEX, we scrutinized the code to identify possible improvements that could be\nincorporated into the technology.

liquidity-providing\nscript for BasicSwap DEX. This user-friendly script enables you to offer\nliquidity for your preferred trading pairs and set a markup above or below the\nmarket price that lets you benefit from arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the script is designed to automatically republish your offers when\nthey expire, adhering to your predefined pricing strategy. This ensures that\nyour offers consistently reflect the current market rate, plus any additional\npremium you have chosen to apply.\n\n> Note: While this is currently made available as a companion script, we\nanticipate that many of its features will eventually be integrated into\nBasicSwap's core functionality.\nHow to Get Started\nTo get started, simply update your BasicSwap DEX instance. The script is\nincluded in the basicswap/scripts folder.\n\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Academy): \n   https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Youtube): https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ\n\nTo run the script, you’ll need to first edit the JSON template configuration\nfile (template_createoffers.json) included with the update to your liking, then\nrename it to createoffers.json. You can find the instructions on how to properly\nedit that file, as well as all possible variables, here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html] \non the Particl Academy.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Liquidity Tools Guide — Particl Academy latest documentationLearn\nhow to use the liquidity tools available for the BasicSwap DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html]\nOnce that’s done, simply run the script with the command python createoffers.py. \n\n> Note: The script needs to run continuously to be take effect. Closing the\nterminal tab that runs it will terminate it. \n\nFor this reason, we recommend executing the script using Byobu\n[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \nor Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen].\nConsiderations and Recommendations\n * For the script to correctly republish orders and update prices, it must keep\n   on running. Starting to script and then closing the terminal tab will shut it\n   down. As such, we recommend running it with a background task processor, such\n   as Byobu\n   [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \n   or Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen] for example.\n * This script is best used in combination with a cloud-based version of\n   BasicSwap. When combined with a VPS setup, you can then ensure that both your\n   BasicSwap node and your script keep running 24/7, offering a true hands-off\n   approach to liquidity provision. Follow this link\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhRe0WuYgZs&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfxAswJnqlh_KbHvWCUFqFVF&index=10] \n   for a complete video tutorial on how to setup BasicSwap DEX on a cloud.\n * Be mindful that, once a swap completes, your offers are not taken off of the\n   order book. As such, it might not be ideal to set your offers as\n   “auto-accept” if you only intend on making one swap. We have a couple of\n   solutions to give the options to limit the number of swaps per order which\n   will come at a later stage, but for now, it’s important to be aware of this\n   behaviour.\n * Be careful about your configuration file’s formatting. JSON requires you to\n   keep the exact same indentations and logic, so watch out when editing the\n   file.\n * The script defaults to using adaptor signatures, which will cause issues if\n   you’re using a non-Segwit coin on the offering side (i.e., Firo, PIVX). In\n   those cases, make sure to configure the pair to use secret hash swaps by\n   putting \"swap_type\": \"secret_hash\" in the configuration file.\n * If you use the production (isolated) docker setup, you can bundle the script\n   with your BasicSwap launch sequence by adding it to your docker-compose\n   configuration file (\n   https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/docker/production/compose-fragments/8_script.yml\n   ).\n\nBecome a Liquidity Provider!\nLiquidity is fundamental to order book based exchanges, which is why we need\nyour assistance.

As such, it might not be ideal to set your offers as “auto-accept” if you only intend on making one swap. We have a couple of solutions to give the options to limit the number of swaps per order which will come at a later stage, but for now, it’s important to be aware of this behaviour.</li><li>Be careful about your configuration file’s formatting. JSON requires you to keep the exact same indentations and logic, so watch out when editing the file.</li><li>The script defaults to using adaptor signatures, which will cause issues if you’re using a non-Segwit coin on the offering side (i.e., Firo, PIVX). In those cases, make sure to configure the pair to use secret hash swaps by putting <code class=\"language-text\">\"swap_type\": \"secret_hash\"</code> in the configuration file.</li><li>If you use the production (isolated) docker setup, you can bundle the script with your BasicSwap launch sequence by adding it to your docker-compose configuration file (<a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/docker/production/compose-fragments/8_script.yml\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/docker/production/compose-fragments/8_script.yml</a>).</li></ul><h2 id=\"become-a-liquidity-provider-\">Become a Liquidity Provider!</h2><p>Liquidity is fundamental to order book based exchanges, which is why we need your assistance.

We'll delve into\nthis topic later on.\n\nAbout the Event \nFrom the beginning, Monerotopia aimed to be different from large corporate\ncryptocurrency events such as Consensus or Bitcoin Miami. Indeed, the focus was\non quality over quantity, yet the event still attracted a respectable number of\nattendees. \n\nThis was partly due to Monerotopia's decision to establish a market of craftsmen\nin the event's center, many of whom later became Monero sellers, but really, the\nsheer number of quality projects either presenting or attending was enough to\ndraw in a very focused crowd.\n\nThe venue was divided into distinct areas such as the market, main stage (where\nDr. Kap spoke), remote stage, privacy tech loft, and a workshop zone. Traffic\nremained consistently high across all areas, reflecting the good choice of\nlocation for that particular event.\n\nGoals at Monerotopia \nWith a privacy and liberty-centric theme and an impressive lineup of projects,\nincluding Monero-based Cake Wallet, Monerujo, and SeraiDEX, but also other\nprivacy projects such as Firo, Nym, Oxen/Session, Zano, only to name a few, our\ngoal was to establish valuable connections with other projects and key\nindividuals. Unfortunately, DarkFi was unable to attend, but we hope to catch up\nwith them at Monerokon next month. \n\nOur mission was to create connections, make new friends, and explore\ncollaborative potential with other projects and individuals, and to that we can\nsay that it was a definitive success. We eagerly anticipate the many\nopportunities and future collaborations resulting from these discussions, as\nthey will be a major contributor to make preserving privacy and freedom easier\nthan ever before.\n\nDr Kap’s Presentation \nOn the event's final day, we were honored to give a 40-minute presentation to a\nfull room of privacy enthusiasts. The response to our message was incredibly\npositive, and it visibly resonated with the audience a lot.\n\n> Dr Kap @thegreatestdoc [https://twitter.com/thegreatestdoc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] \npresenting BasicSwap an atomic swap DEX in beta (with $FIRO\n[https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FIRO&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] support) and\npromoting a more inclusive privacy coin ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/Q4TYGZD9TS\n[https://t.co/Q4TYGZD9TS]\n\n— Firo $FIRO (@firoorg) May 7, 2023\n[https://twitter.com/firoorg/status/1655312001956999169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nThe speech was attended by various individuals and projects we had networked\nwith throughout the event, as well as some Particl community members who\ntraveled to Mexico to meet us and a whole slew of new faces. With multiple\nrounds of applause and high enthusiasm, the speech was, in our view, a\nresounding success.\n\nWhile it was broadcast live for virtual ticket holders, it will be publicly\npublished online by the Monerotopia crew very soon.\n\nParticl Booth at the Privacy Loft\nAlthough the event prioritized quality over quantity, our booth consistently\nattracted attendees and saw a considerable boost in activity after Dr Kap's\npresentation. \n\nThe smaller crowd allowed for longer, more meaningful conversations with people\ngenuinely interested in the topics of privacy and freedom, and it helped in\nbuilding more solid relationships with awesome people. This also enabled us to\nexplore the venue and support our new friends by attending to their speeches.\n\nNew Friends \nWe are thrilled to have established new friendships and strengthened existing\nones with various projects and individuals. These connections will undoubtedly\nbenefit the advancement of privacy technology as a whole.\n\nAs everyone begins returning home or settling in, we look forward to continuing\nthe many ongoing discussions about collaborations, partnerships, and\nintegrations with them. We are thrilled to support them in their groundbreaking\nwork and look forward to helping each other in solidarity.\n\nAs Dr Kap's speech demonstrated, Particl and BasicSwap aim to create a coherent\nlayer that unites privacy projects by building not only technology but also\ngenuine, lasting relationships.

upcoming Monerotopia speech\n[https://monerotopia.com/], and expanding on some of the topics raised in this\nprevious article [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]\n, this article goes over our thoughts on privacy and interoperability in\nprivacy-centric projects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe current state of the world is a cause for great concern, particularly for\nthose who support freedom and oppose censorship, value independent thought, and\nprioritize personal privacy. Global economies are facing an unprecedented\ncrisis, and governments are enacting increasingly oppressive measures that\nthreaten individual autonomy, even discussing outright bans on encryption. It is\nbecoming increasingly difficult to protect one's freedom on a daily basis.\n\nFortunately, the advent of Bitcoin provided a glimmer of hope. In the years to\ncome, the release of Bitcoin may likely be viewed as one of the most influential\nevents in modern history, given that blockchain and decentralized networks\nprovide us with concrete tools to resist those who seek to restrict our rights\nand freedoms.\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto brought this incredible gift to the world, humanity stood\non the precipice. However, Satoshi's legacy now rests with us, as we continue to\npush the boundaries of privacy coins by adding more robust obfuscation layers\nand anonymizing transactions, thereby preventing cryptocurrencies from becoming\na financial surveillance tool.\n\nUltimately, the cypherpunk mission, as bold as it is, is to build a parallel\neconomy, completely independent and separate from the global fiat system, in\nwhich its users can accomplish their everyday needs without having to depend on\nlegacy financial systems anymore.\n\nThis article is about the survival of our privacy and liberties within a world\nthat is actively seeking to destroy them and what we believe the path forward\nis.\n\nPrivacy, Intercompatibility, and Resilience\nCompetition can be a driving force for progress, motivating individuals to\nperform better, increase productivity, and push the boundaries of innovation,\nultimately resulting in enhanced benefits for end-users.\n\nHowever, while this holds true in crypto, it also creates avoidable tensions\nbetween projects and often leads to a situation where the innovations of one\nproject are overlooked by those who do not possess a financial stake in that\nparticular project. This division in the community limits our collective\ncapacity to address the imminent challenges to privacy that we previously\noutlined, a suboptimal outcome given the substantial force wielded by those who\nseek to undermine our freedoms.\n\nUltimately, to stand a chance against this opposition, we should strive to\nembrace our uniqueness and foster creativity; different projects working on\ndifferent ideas and solutions, but we must unite together in a decentralized,\nprivate, and free economy in which all of our projects thrive and can be\nintegrated.\n\nTo do just that, we are presently focused on a comprehensive improvement of our\necosystem codebase\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], which is\ndesigned to reflect our core values. Among them:\n\n * Privacy, obviously.\n * Uncompromising decentralization.\n * And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies\n   with which our dApps function.\n\nWith an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy\nprojects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This\nallows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing\nwithin an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys\nextremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.\n\nEmbodying Agnosticism\nThe Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are\ncurrently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing\nfor various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order\nto power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.\n\nFor instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own\nnative SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our\nmodular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and\nonly request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an\nSMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.\n\nAdopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other\ncompatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps.\nThe final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements\nof their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.\n\nThis not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use\ncases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to\nParticl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have\nworked on.\n\nIt also makes them more resilient.\nConsider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable\nits distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that\nSMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event.\nAlthough such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a\nminor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an\nalternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user\nwould lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers\nfails to act in a timely manner.\n\nThis is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas\nother projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without\ncompeting with each other but without having to start developing together. We\ncould sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples,\nbut I think you get the gist.\n\nBecause technology advances so fast, we must build solutions that will endure\nthe test of time. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger,\ntogether, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the\nperfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.\n\nHowever, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules.\nAfter all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have\nunique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.\n\nIn our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in\nwhich SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl\ndApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying\nthe different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy\nand freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.\n\nCurrency Agnosticism \nCurrency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in\nprivacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example:\nyou can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without\nthird-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely\ndifferent coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so.\nThis introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in\norder to acquire this specific coin.\n\nThat is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re\ncurrently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for\nother coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end\nswap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.\n\nWhile several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges,\ncan be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal\noutcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by the Changelly\ndebacle\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/] \nwithin the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a free,\nindependent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy without central points of\nfailure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.\n\nWhat Privacy Ramifications?\nWhile designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling\npossibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency\nprojects, it also offers much more than just convenience or a 'preferred\ncurrency for payments.'\n\nLet’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a\ncryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy\ntechnology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous\ntransactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions\nusing decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their\ncoins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using\nzero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.\n\nThis is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and\ncons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and\ncosts. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with\nother privacy setups.\n\nLet us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl\nMarketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which\nuses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the\ntransaction using any currency.\n\nNow, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus\ntransaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides\nyou with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send\nthe coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem\ntoken is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to\nbuy the item on the marketplace.\n\nBy this simple act, you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine\nboth Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction, compounding both\nof their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example\nof what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy\ntech.\n\nAgnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace\nAlthough the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in\na truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique\nproperties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer\nfor all Particl Marketplace transactions.\n\nThere are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via\nthe use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace,\nand perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear\nthat the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment\nsystems are limitless.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This division in the community limits our collective capacity to address the imminent challenges to privacy that we previously outlined, a suboptimal outcome given the substantial force wielded by those who seek to undermine our freedoms.</p><p>Ultimately, to stand a chance against this opposition, we should strive to embrace our uniqueness and foster creativity; different projects working on different ideas and solutions, but we must unite together in a decentralized, private, and free economy in which all of our projects thrive and can be integrated.</p><p>To do just that, we are presently focused on a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">comprehensive improvement of our ecosystem codebase</a>, which is designed to reflect our core values. Among them:</p><ul><li>Privacy, obviously.</li><li>Uncompromising decentralization.</li><li>And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies with which our dApps function.</li></ul><p>With an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy projects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This allows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing within an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys extremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.</p><h2 id=\"embodying-agnosticism\">Embodying Agnosticism</h2><p>The Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are currently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing for various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order to power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.</p><p>For instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own native SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our modular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and only request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an SMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.</p><p>Adopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other compatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps. The final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements of their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.</p><p>This not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use cases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to Particl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have worked on.</p><h3 id=\"it-also-makes-them-more-resilient-\">It also makes them more resilient.</h3><p>Consider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable its distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that SMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event. Although such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a minor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an alternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user would lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers fails to act in a timely manner.</p><p>This is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas other projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without competing with each other but without having to start developing together. We could sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples, but I think you get the gist.</p><p>Because technology advances so fast, <strong>we must build solutions that will endure the test of time</strong>. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger, together, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the perfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.</p><p>However, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules. After all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have unique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.</p><p>In our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in which SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl dApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying the different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy and freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.</p><h2 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism </h2><p>Currency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in privacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example: you can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without third-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely different coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so. This introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in order to acquire this specific coin.</p><p>That is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re currently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for other coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end swap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.</p><p>While several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges, can be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal outcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/\">the Changelly debacle</a> within the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a <strong>free, independent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy</strong> without central points of failure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.</p><h3 id=\"what-privacy-ramifications\">What Privacy Ramifications?</h3><p>While designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling possibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency projects, <strong>it also offers much more than just convenience</strong> or a 'preferred currency for payments.'</p><p>Let’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a cryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy technology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous transactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions using decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their coins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using zero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.</p><p>This is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and cons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and costs. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with other privacy setups.</p><p>Let us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl Marketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which uses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the transaction using any currency.</p><p>Now, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus transaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides you with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send the coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem token is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to buy the item on the marketplace.</p><p>By this simple act, <strong>you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine both Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction</strong>, compounding both of their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example of what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy tech.</p><h2 id=\"agnosticism-part-and-the-particl-marketplace\">Agnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace</h2><p>Although the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in a truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique properties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer for all Particl Marketplace transactions.  </p><p>There are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via the use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace, and perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear that the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment systems are limitless.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This improves the user experience by enabling users\n   to select offers that will instantaneously initiate the swap process without\n   having to wait for the other party act manually.\n * A variety of more advanced trading and management features.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBuilding a privacy-first and pro-liberty environment without concessions demands\ntime and mindful considerations, and we are incredibly grateful for your ongoing\nsupport and passion for the Particl mission.\n\nAs always, if you encounter any bug, issue, or have feedback you'd like to let\nus know about, don't hesitate to reach out to the team or directly leave a\ncomment (or pull request) here on Github\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
