This blog\npost will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and\nstrategy as we progress onward.\n\nTable of Contents\n * Putting Marketing in Context\n * Upcoming Marketing Initiatives\n * BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener\n * Community Empowerment\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPutting Marketing in Context\nFirst thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid\nany confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness,\nPR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to\ngain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging\ntowards making Particl more known, liked, and used.\n\nWhy do Marketing?\nIn the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.\n\n * Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)\n * Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.\n\nFor marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need\nto be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any\nmarketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the\necosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to\nstick around and be clear.\n\nThis strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project\nonly spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a\n“spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an\nextreme cost.\n\nHow to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?\nTo achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches\nto marketing.\n\nProduct-focused marketing: Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what\nproducts the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences.\nThis aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked\nto adoption efforts.\n\nBrand awareness and notoriety building: The other approach is to increase\nParticl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part\nof “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve\nnever really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the\nmore free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. \n\nThese two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns\n(mentioned a bit further down this post).\n\nHow is Marketing Funded at Particl?\nParticl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of\ncrowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates\nout of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic\ntreasury system.\n\nThis means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very\nlarge-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the\n“pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets\nusually leverage.\n\nAdditionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current\nlow liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very\ncareful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant\ndownward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.\n\nMarketing Expectations\nDue to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within\nthe blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan\naround that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.\n\nThat’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and\nstrategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many\ninitiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of\nbeing widespread.\n\nAdditionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product.\nIndeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can\nstill be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically\napt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl\nevolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means\nthat marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the\nproduct might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the\nright audiences to target is key.\n\nUpcoming Marketing Initiatives\nNow that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a\ndeeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in\nprogress.\n\nWhat we've done recently\nRe-initiating direct mail marketing Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications. This aims to\nre-engage people who’ve shown interest in Particl in the past and stay connected\nwith current fans. Direct mail marketing is a basic but powerful marketing tool\nand will be used sporadically (we won’t spam your inbox) for essential and\nbundled communications pieces. \n\nIf you still haven’t subscribed to our newsletter, don’t hesitate to do so; it’s\nthe best way to stay in touch! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Particl Academy The Particl Academy is the\nuser-friendly guide to get started with Particl and become more familiar with\nit. It’s a critical piece of information required for newcomers to be able to\nstart using the platform without any hassle. \n\nThis can be the difference between someone interested but who gives up because\nit’s too difficult to get started and someone who sticks around. To browse the\nParticl Academy, simply head over to https://academy.particl.io/ \n\nProduct marketing New roadmap The new development roadmap is not necessarily a\nmarketing item in the proper sense, but it’s nonetheless a vital part of the\nmarketing strategy. That’s because that is where new people usually look to see\nwhat’s coming up next for a project and what is its long-term viability. \n\nThe new roadmap was carefully crafted to make user adoption easier by improving\nthe platform’s accessibility, usability, and user-friendliness. In addition, it\ncommunicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and\nhelps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul. \n\nProduct marketing What's currently in progress\nNew website Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone\nof any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land\nwhen they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a\nmarketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting\nfor its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its\nbest and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better\nconversion rates! \n\nOn that note, we are excited to announce that the new website will go live this\ncoming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021. So make sure to be around next week\nfor its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to\nshow it to everybody! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit) Digital ads are\nhelpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing\nobjectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n\nSecondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us\nto test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can\nthen use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on\nwhat really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we\nare already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few\nother initiatives. \n\nPreparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will\ngradually ramp up within the next three months. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More stories on Particl News At this time,\nParticl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting\nfor those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into\nadvocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain\nParticl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the\nbigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally,\nSEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website. \n\nThis initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few\nwriters. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own\ndedicated “Stories” section. Make sure to have a read when you see a new story\ncome out and share it with the people you think will be interested in it! \n\nBrand awareness Reboot of the Part-Time Show You might remember the Part-Time\nShow, the podcast by Particl ambassador Dr. Kapil. As part of the Particl\nreboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time,\ndifferently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show\nwill feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert. \n\nIt will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including\ne-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed\nnetworks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a\nParticl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much\nmore dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful\ndiscussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s\nsociety. \n\nClubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.\nWe hope that you join along the weekly episodes and participate in the\ndiscussion with us. You might just meet some fascinating folks! More information\nis to come about this in the next few days as we near the first episode. \n\nBrand awareness New team member To help with the many marketing tasks we have on\nour deck, a new team member will join the communications and marketing team in\nNovember. This new team member, which will mostly fill the role of a\ncommunications assistant, will be critical in allowing the team to deploy\nmultiple initiatives in parallel and amplify our efforts. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Community budget Also to help with marketing\nand encourage community initiatives, the team will be setting up and deploying a\ncommunity marketing budget very soon. At the time of this writing, a group has\nbeen formed on Element with a few community members eager to help spread the\nword and deploy initiatives of their own. A community budget intends on\nsupporting these go-getters with resources from the team. \n\nLookup the Community Empowerment section of this blog post further down below\nfor more information on how to get involved. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Occasional Reddit AMAs With the Particl reboot\ngoing on strong, there are a lot of things changing around the project and a ton\nto look out for. But with so much information, it’s possible that you may have\nsome questions. So from time to time, the Particl team will run AMAs on its\nsub-Reddit and pin it so that anyone can ask their questions and have the answer\ndisplayed prominently for all others to see. This should help with transparency\nand circulating important information to the community. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing What comes after\nWider distribution of press releases Distributing press releases in quality\npublications will lead to more organic coverage as editors and writers scout PR\npublications daily for exciting content. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More podcast appearances and interviews With\nimproving Particl's brand awareness in mind, appearing in more podcasts and\ninterviews will help spread the Particl word further and expose the project to\nmany more people. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Publish more documentation For Particl to gain\nadoption, using the platform and understanding how to use it must be as easy as\npossible. Publishing more educational, informational, and technical\ndocumentation will help with that. \n\nProduct marketing Increase social media activity and exposure Crypto Twitter is\nwhere it's at, and Particl needs to have better exposure within that community\nif it wants to go viral. So improving Particl's social media exposure and taking\npart in the discussion is important and planned for the near future. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Integrate other coins into Particl Desktop \nBecause so much has changed with Particl V3, support for other coins is\ntemporarily disabled. We plan on adding that feature back right after releasing\nthe SMSG Manager (roadmap item). Integrating more coins and making it easier for\ntheir users to acquire PART increases the potential for adoption within these\ncommunities. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing New exchange listings Getting listed on new\nexchanges is a no-brainer to improve liquidity, exposure and make the platform\nmore accessible. The team is currently in negotiation with two exchanges and\nshould have more news on the subject soon. More exchange listings are planned as\nlong as the listing costs are reasonable, and the exchange can provide real\nvalue back to the project. \n\nBrand awareness Seed the marketplace with more listings A few months ago, a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html] that\nsuggested seeding the marketplace with many listings was published (and funded).\nAdding thousands of listings will give the marketplace the boost it needs to get\nthe ball rolling and become a vibrant e-commerce platform. This initiative is\ncurrently under active development. \n\nProduct marketing It obviously doesn't stop here, but the team will work on the\nitems mentioned above in the short to mid-term. If you have any marketing ideas\nor suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.\n\nBasicSwap; A Major Door Opener\nWhen it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl\nMarketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind\ndecentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new\nParticl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open\nbeta: BasicSwap.\n\nAs you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t\nknow each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains.\nBasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the\nsame time, the project’s marketing strategy.\n\nIncidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for\ncryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to\nregister and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look\nfor decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share\nof decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an\nexcellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!\n\nBasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible,\nprivate, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads.\nBasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on\nits own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an\nintegrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl\necosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an\nall-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming\nto fruitition!\n\nIn other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful\napp; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader\nParticl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind\nwhen you talk about Particl to other people.\n\nCommunity Empowerment\nThe best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community.\nThat’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a\nnew dedicated budget!\n\nDo you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead?\nThen simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a\nwritten proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked\nto publish it on the CCS [https://ccs.particl.io]. Once your proposal is live,\nthe team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.\n\nPublishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level\nof transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps\ndetermine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to\nparticipate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!\n\n> Note 1: Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels\nof detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write\nthem down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative\nyourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in\nPART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately\nheaded by whoever makes a proposal.\n> Note 2: If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to\nlead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the\nidea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own dedicated “Stories” section.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

This blog post will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and strategy as we progress onward.</p><h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</h2><p>First thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid any confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness, PR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to gain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging towards making Particl more known, liked, and used.</p><h3 id=\"why-do-marketing\">Why do Marketing?</h3><p>In the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.</p><ul><li>Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)</li><li>Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.</li></ul><p>For marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need to be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any marketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the ecosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to stick around and be clear.</p><p>This strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project only spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a “spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an extreme cost.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-achieve-our-marketing-objectives\">How to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?</h3><p>To achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches to marketing.</p><p><strong>Product-focused marketing: </strong>Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what products the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences. This aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked to adoption efforts.</p><p><strong>Brand awareness and notoriety building: </strong>The other approach is to increase Particl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part of “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve never really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the more free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. </p><p>These two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns (mentioned a bit further down this post).</p><h3 id=\"how-is-marketing-funded-at-particl\">How is Marketing Funded at Particl?</h3><p>Particl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of crowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates out of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic treasury system.</p><p>This means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very large-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the “pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets usually leverage.</p><p>Additionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current low liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very careful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant downward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.</p><h3 id=\"marketing-expectations\">Marketing Expectations</h3><p>Due to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within the blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan around that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.</p><p>That’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and strategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many initiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of being widespread.</p><p>Additionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product. Indeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can still be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically apt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl evolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means that marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the product might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the right audiences to target is key.</p><h2 id=\"upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</h2><p>Now that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in progress.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What we've done recently</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Re-initiating direct mail marketing</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

As such, we are happy to release\nthe new updated development roadmap and major milestones ahead of us.\n\nIn this post, we’ll expand on Particl’s vision for the future and break down\nevery roadmap item. We also have a few words on marketing, PR, adoption, and the\nnew website so make sure to read this blog post in full!\n\nTable of Contents\n * Particl V3\n * Roadmap objectives\n * Discover the new roadmap\n * BasicSwap Open Beta\n * Web framework\n * What about marketing?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 – The Foundation of Particl's entire ecosystem\nThe release of Particl V3 on mainnet represents a major milestone for the\nproject. Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which\nthe future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this\nessential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a\nnecessary step in the evolution of the project.\n\nIndeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use\napps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end\nfunctionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply\nput, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of\nthe roadmap items presented today.\n\nRoadmap Objectives\nThe roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.\n\nImprove Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of\naudiences.\nParticl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application\nthat can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course,\nthis is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking\ntechnology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making\nParticl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.\n\nImprove the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.\nBecause Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features,\nfunctionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot\nof sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore,\nthe Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the\ndevelopment of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to\ngenerate adoption.\n\nImprove Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of\nadoption.\nIn a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption\nof the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be\nready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no\ndowntime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the\ncase, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important\nfactor in the conception of this roadmap.\n\nDiscover the New Roadmap\nDue to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different\ncategories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear\ndocument. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at\na time depending on various factors.\n\nTags\nOn the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag\nrepresents a different status.\n\n * Completed: The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant\n   version of it has been deployed.\n * In progress: The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already\n   started being worked on.\n * Research: The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently\n   under research.\n * Ongoing: The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.\n * Later: The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap\n   items in the list.\n * [NO TAG]: The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment,\n   but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX  What?\nA cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps\nand SMSG.\n\nWhy?\nBasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and\nSMSG. It lets you swap a vast number of coins privately without anyone in\nbetween and without paying trading fees. BasicSwap is compatible with multiple\ncoins like PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and more. \n\nIn progress Closed beta SMSG 2.0  What?\nA new version of SMSG that is significantly more scalable.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption increases and more Particl apps use SMSG as its backbone,\nSMSG 2.0 ensures that the network can scale appropriately. This massive update\nwill make it possible to support all current and upcoming Particl apps without\nany scaling issue. \n\nResearch Lightning Network GUI  What?\nA user-friendly interface for Particl's Lightning Network.\n\nWhy?\nParticl's Lightning Network is already live on mainnet, but there's currently no\neasy way to use it. Particl Electrum provides a user-friendly interface for\neveryone to enjoy all the benefits of the Lightning Network; near-infinite\ntransaction scalability, near-zero fees, near-instant settlements, and more. \n\nIn progress Web framework (marketplace on the web)  What?\nA web framework to bring the Particl ecosystem to the web.\n\nWhy?\nFor Particl to gain maximum adoption, it needs to be accessible and operable\nthrough the web. Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the\nmarketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is\nexpected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser\nmay be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e.,\nsearch engine friendly content) will be added over time. \n\nLater Research Encrypted messaging app  What?\nA decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.\n\nWhy?\nThe SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network. With a proper\ninterface, it can be used as a messaging application that's fast, secure,\nunstoppable, uncensorable, and private. This \"chat\" functionality may come in\ndifferent packages over time (i.e., Particl Desktop app, integration into the\nmarketplace, mobile app, etc.). \n\nLater \"Major milestones\" are the most important deliverables of the new roadmap.\nThey are major releases that introduce key functionalities to the Particl\necosystem and craft the path forward. They will massively contribute to\nimproving Particl and its adoption by making it more stable, resilient, private,\nand scalable. \n\nThese milestones are not necessarily intended to be worked on one right after\nthe other. They usually require other roadmap items to be completed before they\ncan be started, meaning the development focus is spread across all roadmap\ncategories and not just this one.\n\nOther Categories\nRoadmap items related to the marketplace, desktop client, SMSG network, or the\nblockchain are grouped into their own categories. They are important features,\nadditions, and improvements to the components and products of the Particl\necosystem that already exist. \n\nAlthough these roadmap items are not included in the \"major milestones\"\ncategory, they are just as important and provide direct value to the ecosystem\nand improves its adoption potential by making it more accessible, usable, and\nfeature-complete.\n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality  What?\nAn improved zap function that gives stakers more flexibility and privacy.\n\nWhy?\nThe new zap function makes it more efficient and confidential to zap funds when\nactivating cold staking. \n\nCompleted Particl Electrum  What?\nA Particl version of the Electrum light wallet, with Lightning Network GUI\nincluded.\n\nWhy?\nElectrum is an easy-to-use and popular light wallet that introduces various\nfeatures and capabilities. One of them is a GUI for using Particl's Lightning\nNetwork. Electrum will not only make it easy to use the Lightning Network, but\nit's also expected to serve as the backbone for future components of the Particl\necosystem. \n\nIn progress Taproot support  What?\nA new protocol that brings new, more efficient, flexible, and private ways to\ntransact PART.\n\nWhy?\nThe Taproot update includes many new features and capabilities, notably in the\narea of privacy. This update is particularly interesting considering the complex\ntransactions generated by Particl's apps like the marketplace and the upcoming\nBasicSwap DEX. Taproot is expected to improve their privacy even more and reduce\nfees. \n\nPending activation Trezor wallet support  What?\nA better support for Trezor hardware devices.\n\nWhy?\nTrezor is a hardware device that lets users safely store coins offline. Having\nnew hardware storage solution for Particl provides users with yet another safe\nway to store coins the way they prefer. \n\nIn progress New blockchain explorers  What?\nThe deployment of new blockchain explorers.\n\nWhy?\nMany different blockchain explorers provide additional data that Particl's\ncurrent primary blockchain explorer (Insight) doesn't. For this reason, having\nmore blockchain explorers opens up the door to new opportunities, such as\nenabling Particl's upcoming web framework. \n\nIn progress Scaling and performance upgrades  What?\nA wide range of planned improvements to make Particl more scalable, stable, and\nfast.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption grows, the ecosystem has to support the increased traffic.\nIt also needs to be able to process a large number of transactions and SMSG\nmessages. Various improvements are planned as part of the regular Particl Core\nupdates to ensure that this is the case. \n\nOngoing PSBT support  What?\nA unified and more advanced multi-signature format.\n\nWhy?\nPSBT is a more modern multi-signature protocol that improves on current\nmulti-signature solutions. It makes it easier to use for wallets and nodes, and\nmakes it compatible across more devices. PSBT also enables better CoinJoin-like\nfunctionality. \n\nShamir's secret-sharing for mnemonics (SSS)  What?\nAn improvement to how mnemonics work in deterministic wallets.\n\nWhy?\nSSS is a new, improved format for deterministic wallet mnemonics that \"splits a\nmaster secret into unique parts which can be distributed among participants. A\nspecified minimum number of parts is required to be supplied in order to\nreconstruct the original secret. Knowledge of fewer than the required number of\nparts does not leak information about the master secret.\" \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import  What?\nMore features to the current inventory import tool. Includes importing images,\ncategories, product codes, and more right from a CSV file.\n\nWhy?\nMakes it easier and less time-consuming for large-scale vendors to open shop on\nParticl Marketplace. Currently, many operations still require a manual,\none-by-one operation which is a tedious process for vendors with hundreds of\nlistings. \n\nIn progress Additional shipping and delivery options  What?\nAdditional shipping and delivery options to satisfy more needs (per country\nshipping costs, digital item deliveries, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nAdding more shipping options helps sellers charge a more accurate shipping cost\ndepending on the buyer's location and shipping preference. This roadmap item\nalso includes new delivery methods for digital items, such as buyers providing a\ncrypto address (i.e., NFTs) or a user code/username, for example. \n\nIn progress Escrow improvements  What?\nA wide range of escrow improvements to satisfy more use-cases.\n\nWhy?\nAt this time, escrow is mandatory on all transactions and requires a 100%\nsecurity deposit rate. However, its current form may not be ideal for all types\nof transactions, sellers, and buyers. For this reason, a wide range of escrow\nimprovements and options are planned to be deployed. This includes making escrow\noptional and introducing new features like an auto-destroy timer, an\nauto-complete timer, an adjustable security deposit requirement, partial\nrefunds, and automation to reduce the number of steps required in the buy flow.\nAll these escrow features are optional, leaving users with multiple options to\nsatisfy their needs. \n\nIn progress Research Advanced inventory management  What?\nAn inventory management tool that lets sellers indicate the quantity in stock\nfor each of their listings. It also lets them set up variants for items with\nmultiple purchasing options (i.e., color, size, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nThis tool significantly improves the marketplace by introducing a key e-commerce\nfeature to specify the number of available quantities. In addition, instead of\ncreating multiple listings of the same item, sellers with products containing\nvariants (i.e., storage size for USB keys) will be able to let buyers choose\ntheir purchasing preferences from a single listing. \n\nNew types of order  What?\nAdded support for new types of orders, such as bidding auctions.\n\nWhy?\nAllows the marketplace to provide a different experience for different types of\nusers, products, and niches. For example, the art industry heavily uses bidding\nauctions and may be more inclined to use the marketplace if this feature is\nenabled. \n\nPrice pegging and custom display  What?\nThe ability to dynamically adjust and display listing prices based on the value\nof other currencies (i.e., USD).\n\nWhy?\nDue to PART's price fluctuation, many users may prefer pricing and viewing\nlistings based on different currencies (i.e., USD, EUR, BTC). This roadmap item\ndepends on price oracles, which is a future functionality provided by Particl\nDesktop plugins (SMSG bots). \n\nLater Reputation system  What?\nA reputation system, best used in combination with Particl's escrow.\n\nWhy?\nBefore transacting, both the seller and the buyer want to ensure that the other\nparty is trustworthy. A reputation system is a tool that helps with making that\nassessment. It provides additional information about the other user and, when\ncombined with Particl's unique escrow system, offers a strong level of\nconfidence and protection when trading with strangers. \n\nLater Research Buy flow messaging  What?\nThe ability to talk with the other participant during a marketplace transaction.\n\nWhy?\nThere are a lot of situations where both participants of a marketplace\ntransaction may want to communicate together. Whether that's for asking a\nquestion before buying, providing an update, or dealing with a shipping issue, a\nbuilt-in messaging system massively improves the user experience and helps\nresolve order-related issues. \n\nAdditional market permissions  What?\nThe ability for a market owner to set special permissions for other users.\n\nWhy?\nA market owner may want to make their market or storefront invite-only, or they\nmay wish to elect moderators. This feature makes community markets and\nstorefronts more versatile, leading to more potential use-cases. \n\nResearch Moderation system update  What?\nImprovements to the marketplace's moderation system.\n\nWhy?\nAs no central authority has the power to control the marketplace and its\ncontent, the community is the one in charge of moderation. The current system is\na basic process that lets anyone flag undesirable content. Several improvements\nare being considered, notably in relation to cold staking pools and AI systems.\nImproving the moderation system and its capabilities will make it more effective\nand lead to more people using it. \n\nResearch Webhook integrations  What?\nThe ability for Particl Marketplace to connect with third-party services.\n\nWhy?\nWhile the marketplace is entirely decentralized, users can manually add\nthird-party services through app extensions and plugins. Webhook integrations\nare such services that can be manually added. They allow the marketplace to\nconnect to external platforms that provide services like inventory management,\naccounting, external notifications, etc. Any platform or person can deploy their\nown integration; the possibilities are endless. \n\nIn progress Other DSN integrations (i.e., IPFS)  What?\nThe ability to host large-size content like images on different data network\nsystems (DSN).\n\nWhy?\nImages make up for the majority of the data contained in SMSG messages. Hosting\nlarge-size content on external networks clears a lot of space on the SMSG\nnetwork, allowing it to scale better and be more efficient. Additionally, other\nDSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG,\nopening up the doors to more opportunities. \n\nResearch Stable payments  What?\nA way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.\n\nWhy?\nPART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users,\nespecially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve\nthe stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a\nmajor improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability.\nThis is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a\nnear-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be\nintegrated on Particl Desktop using plugins. \n\nLater Research Other features and improvements  What?\nA wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.\n\nWhy?\nA wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part\nof Particl Desktop's regular release schedule. These additions usually take less\ntime to get ready and can come up due to user feedback or problems encountered.\nA few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown\nformatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options,\noptional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time. The\nteam wants to keep a flexible approach to development and expects a few features\nand improvements to require to be added suddenly. \n\nOngoing Desktop\nSMSG controller  What?\nA system that allows apps and developers to interact with the SMSG network more\neffectively.\n\nWhy?\nA streamlined process for interacting with the SMSG network is required for apps\nand developers to easily and safely interact with the SMSG network. The SMSG\nmanager also provides various failsafe mechanisms and massively increases SMSG's\ncompatibility with future apps other than the marketplace. It's an important\nstep towards making Particl more developer-friendly. \n\nCore and Desktop separation  What?\nBetter separation of Particl Core and Particl Desktop.\n\nWhy?\nMaking Particl Desktop even more independent of Particl Core makes the client\nmore efficient. This improves the quality of the code making other features and\nfunctionalities easier to maintain and deploy. \n\nApp extensions and plugins  What?\nSupport for app extensions and plugins to provide third-party functionalities to\nthe desktop client.\n\nWhy?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized network and functions without any\nthird-party intervention. However, intermediaries may provide helpful services\nand features that may benefit users (i.e., data oracles, crypto swap services,\netc.). The app extension and plugin system lets anyone broadcast and add\nthird-party services on Particl Desktop. \n\nCore configuration editor  What?\nA system that lets users modify configuration settings, such as easily enabling\nTor routing.\n\nWhy?\nManually editing Particl Core configuration files can provide a lot of extra\nfunctionalities to users, but it can also break things in unexpected ways. A\nconfig management system lets the user tweak these low-level settings without\nany potential issue. This can be useful, for example, to easily connect to the\nTor network. \n\nIn progress Wallet encryption options  What?\nThe ability to delete the encryption of a wallet or change its password.\n\nWhy?\nThere are many situations where a user may want to delete the encryption of a\nwallet or change its password. This is what this roadmap item introduces. \n\nBetter cold staking functionality  What?\nMove staking and cold staking to a separate section or app.\n\nWhy?\nMaking a separate section or app for staking (and cold staking) allows for a\nbetter way to provide more options and features. This makes staking and cold\nstaking more intuitive and powerful. \n\nOS notifications  What?\nThe addition of various push notifications to the user's operating system.\n\nWhy?\nReceiving notifications through your operating system lets you stay connected\nand up-to-date with what's going on with your Particl-related activities.\nNotifications can be pushed for many different events such as a marketplace\norder update, an inbound PART transaction, a completed escrow, etc. \n\nWant to Suggest a New Feature or Improvement?\nYour feedback and ideas are incredibly valuable! If you have any feature,\nimprovement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know\nabout it.\n\nSimply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., Particl Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] or Particl Core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues]), and create a new issue with\nthe \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer\nwill see your suggestion.\n\nKeep Track of Things\nTo keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every\nweek on Friday, a development progress report on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the\ndevelopments and updates. \n\nThis roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new Particl.io\n[https://Particl.io/] website. It will be regularly updated as new items are\nadded, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. \n\nBasicSwap Open Beta\nBasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a\ncross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the\nSMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC,\nand others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed\nbeta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having\ntaken place during the last few weeks.\n\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required\ntweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it\ncan be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.\n\nAs we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect\nmuch more information about it to be released shortly on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become\ninvincible!\n\nWeb Framework\nMaking Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the\nweb with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making\nParticl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of\nadoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.\n\nHowever, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other\nvital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more\nfunctional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential\nroadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more\nimmediate focus.\n\nAdditionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as\nalternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required\nto fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as\n\"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate\npriority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. \n\nJust like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information\nabout it when its time comes.\n\nWhat About Marketing?\nNow that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on\nmainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness\ncampaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few\ninitiatives already being live and with many more in line.\n\nOn that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about\nParticl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and\nadoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on\nParticl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the\nplatform successful.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nstill in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and\ncomplicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is\nintended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the\naudiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with\nthe features available at the time.\n\nThe New Website is Key\nThe new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is\nwhere newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are\nthe most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's\nmost crucial marketing statement.\n\nTo that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one,\nimproving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much\nclearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on\nParticl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the\nproject has to offer to them.\n\nWe are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the\nconversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in\nmaking future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.\n\n> Note: Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new\nwebsite release to next week. One of our team members involved with its\ndevelopment has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several\ndays this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time.\nThis team member is now recovering fine.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser may be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e., search engine friendly content) will be added over time.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Encrypted messaging app</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            The SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network.

Hosting large-size content on external networks clears a lot of space on the SMSG network, allowing it to scale better and be more efficient. Additionally, other DSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG, opening up the doors to more opportunities.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck13\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck13\">Stable payments</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            PART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users, especially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve the stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a major improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability. This is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a near-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be integrated on Particl Desktop using plugins.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck14\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck14\">Other features and improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            A wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part of Particl Desktop's regular release schedule.

A few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown formatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options, optional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time.

If you have any feature, improvement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know about it.</p><p>Simply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Particl Desktop</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\">Particl Core</a>), and create a new issue with the \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer will see your suggestion.</p><h3 id=\"keep-track-of-things\">Keep Track of Things</h3><p>To keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every week on Friday, a development progress report on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the developments and updates. </p><p>This roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new <a href=\"https://Particl.io/\">Particl.io</a> website. It will be regularly updated as new items are added, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. </p><h2 id=\"basicswap-open-beta\">BasicSwap Open Beta</h2><p>BasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag represents a different status.</p><ul><li><strong>Completed: </strong>The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant version of it has been deployed.</li><li><strong>In progress:</strong> The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already started being worked on.</li><li><strong>Research:</strong> The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently under research.</li><li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.</li><li><strong>Later:</strong> The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap items in the list.</li><li><strong>[NO TAG]:</strong> The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment, but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>Major Milestones</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            BasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally.

Additionally, other DSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG, opening up the doors to more opportunities.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck13\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck13\">Stable payments</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            PART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users, especially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve the stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a major improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability. This is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a near-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be integrated on Particl Desktop using plugins.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck14\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck14\">Other features and improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            A wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part of Particl Desktop's regular release schedule.

A few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown formatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options, optional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time.

If you have any feature, improvement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know about it.</p><p>Simply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Particl Desktop</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\">Particl Core</a>), and create a new issue with the \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer will see your suggestion.</p><h3 id=\"keep-track-of-things\">Keep Track of Things</h3><p>To keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every week on Friday, a development progress report on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the developments and updates. </p><p>This roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new <a href=\"https://Particl.io/\">Particl.io</a> website. It will be regularly updated as new items are added, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. </p><h2 id=\"basicswap-open-beta\">BasicSwap Open Beta</h2><p>BasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Now that Particl’s free, unrestricted, and private\nmarketplace has arrived, it’s time to make some noise know about it!\n\nWith the renewal of funding for the team, we have begun to gradually ramp up\nmarketing, promotional, and strategical efforts to turn Particl Marketplace into\na busy place.\n\nNew Website About to Go Live\nAs part of these efforts, we're launching, next week, the first version of\nParticl’s new website. This new website is expected to grow and evolve in the\nweeks to come and aims at better communicating Particl’s vision of a free,\nunrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman, along with\nall the benefits it unlocks.\n\nNew Roadmap\nThe team has established a new roadmap for technical development, marketing, and\nbusiness development. It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and\nobjectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog\npost this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021. We’ve mentioned it a few\ntimes already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re\nconvinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take\nParticl to the next level.\n\nBasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX\nAs occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve\nbeen making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl:\nBasicSwap.\n\nBasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps\nand Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means\nthat it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain\nto another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment\nprocessor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people\nand are inherently private and autonomous.\n\nBasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but\nalready running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly. So\nkeep your eyes fixated on Particl News as we soon begin to publish more\ninformation about it.\n\nMuch More to Come\nThe points mentioned above are sure exciting, but it’s far from the only things\nbeing cooked up at the moment. You can expect more promotional efforts,\ninitiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come. While we\ndon’t want to repeat ourselves too much, the fun is getting started, and the\nbest is yet to come!\n\nYou are the Pioneer!\nThere’s never been a better time to get active and introduce others to the\nworld's most revolutionary marketplace. We need all the buyers and seller we can\nget! So let’s all discuss it with friends and families, in your communities, and\non the web, in places you feel would benefit the most from a fair, unrestricted,\nand private e-commerce environment with no middleman. We are ALL what makes\nParticl happen!\n\nAnd don’t forget! To make it easier, the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/] is there to help you out when introducing Particl\nto others. With its help on your side, you can now turn anybody into a Particl\npro and quickly get them started.\n\nFinally, we highly encourage you to support our current pioneering vendors by\nbuying items from them or referring others to Particl Marketplace.

Now that Particl’s free, unrestricted, and private marketplace has arrived, it’s time to make some noise know about it!</p><p>With the renewal of funding for the team, we have begun to gradually ramp up marketing, promotional, and strategical efforts to turn Particl Marketplace into a busy place.</p><h2 id=\"new-website-about-to-go-live\">New Website About to Go Live</h2><p>As part of these efforts, we're launching, next week, the first version of Particl’s new website. This new website is expected to grow and evolve in the weeks to come and aims at better communicating Particl’s vision of a free, unrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman, along with all the benefits it unlocks.</p><h2 id=\"new-roadmap\">New Roadmap</h2><p>The team has established a new roadmap for technical development, marketing, and business development. It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and objectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog post <strong>this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021</strong>. We’ve mentioned it a few times already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re convinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take Particl to the next level.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-atomic-swap-dex\">BasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX</h2><p>As occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve been making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl: BasicSwap.</p><p>BasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps and Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means that it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain to another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment processor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people and are inherently private and autonomous.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1000w, /glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1435w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>BasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but already running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly. So keep your eyes fixated on Particl News as we soon begin to publish more information about it.</p><h2 id=\"much-more-to-come\">Much More to Come</h2><p>The points mentioned above are sure exciting, but it’s far from the only things being cooked up at the moment. You can expect more promotional efforts, initiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come. While we don’t want to repeat ourselves too much, the fun is getting started, and the best is yet to come!</p><h1 id=\"you-are-the-pioneer-\">You are the Pioneer!</h1><p>There’s never been a better time to get active and introduce others to the world's most revolutionary marketplace. We need all the buyers and seller we can get! So let’s all discuss it with friends and families, in your communities, and on the web, in places you feel would benefit the most from a fair, unrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman. We are ALL what makes Particl happen!</p><p>And don’t forget! To make it easier, the <strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/\">Particl Academy</a></strong> is there to help you out when introducing Particl to others. With its help on your side, you can now turn anybody into a Particl pro and quickly get them started.</p><p>Finally, we highly encourage you to support our current pioneering vendors by buying items from them or referring others to Particl Marketplace.

This would make\nboth of them much easier to use, more flexible, secure, private, and, perhaps\nmore importantly, set the stage for getting adoption from a broader range of\naudiences. This major and long-awaited upgrade is what is now known as “Particl\nV3”. \n\nWe are excited to announce, today, that Particl V3 is going live, on mainnet, on\nthe 29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC! \n\nThanks to all of you in the community for your support, time, passion,\nexperience, and dedication in helping out, testing, and engaging in constructive\nconversations that help shape the future of e-commerce and personal liberties.\nYou are what makes Particl's mission possible; our hats are off to you!\n\nNow let's go over a few basic information you need to know in preparation for\nthe mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhere will it be available?\nParticl V3 refers to the new Particl Desktop (3.0.0) client which gives access\nto the new Particl Marketplace and community governance module. And so, to use\nthe marketplace, you will need to install the latest version of Particl Desktop,\nwhich will be available on the official Particl website\n[https://particl.io/downloads] and the project’s Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] on the 29th of September\n2021 at 12:00 UTC.\n\nWhat can I do to prepare?\nFinalize open orders on previous versions of the marketplace\nParticl V3 is the biggest update to Particl ever since the project was launched\nin 2017. And because the scope of the changes is so large, orders and listings\ncreated on previous versions won't be compatible with Particl V3.\n\nFor this reason, we highly recommend finalizing any open marketplace order on\nprevious versions. But don’t worry, if you have open orders that you cannot\ncomplete at this moment (i.e., the escrow smart-contract is still locked),\nyou’ll be able to switch between Particl Desktop 2.x.x and Particl 3.x.x freely,\nat any time, to finalize orders even if you’ve started using Particl V3.\n\nSpread the good word around you\nWith the long-anticipated Particl V3 release now having an official mainnet\nrelease date, now’s the time to inform people around you and talk about all the\nbenefits that private and unrestricted e-commerce without middlemen offers.\n\nTo support your communication efforts after the release, you'll be able to point\npotential newcomers to the Particl Academy.\n\nThe Particl Academy is Coming!\nTo support the mainnet release of Particl V3, the Particl Academy will launch on\nthe same day (29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC).\n\nThe Particl Academy is your guide to becoming an expert in distributed\ne-commerce with Particl Marketplace. It gives you all the information you need\nto master Particl V3 and the other components of the Particl ecosystem. It’s a\nthorough reference book written in simple and straightforward language that\nanybody can understand.\n\nIf you show Particl to someone new, don’t forget to point them to the Particl\nAcademy! That'll let them quickly learn about it and guide them through their\nfirst steps.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we'd like to invite you to subscribe to our\nnewsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive\ncontent. \n\nAlong with the Particl V3 mainnet release, we are re-initiating our newsletter\ncommunication. We will be pushing news, stories, and other valuable content\nthrough it from now on and subscribing is a perfect way not to miss anything\nimportant.\n\n * Subscribe to Particl's newsletter here: https://bit.ly/3CgyB3q\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee You on Mainnet!\nParticl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of\nParticl is being built; it's just the beginning! \n\nWe also want to remind you to stay tuned as we will release a new,\ngroundbreaking roadmap shortly after the mainnet release of Particl V3. We are\nconvinced that you will be as excited as we are about the path forward. The next\nfew milestones are all about increasing Particl’s accessibility, usability,\nscalability, and, of course, adoption.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your incredible support and confidence throughout the\nentire development cycle of Particl V3. Positive words, constructive feedback,\nand discussions are critical to the success of the Particl ecosystem. We are\nblessed to have you as such a dedicated and passionate community and we're very\nexcited to walk through this journey with you all!\n\nLet’s now make sure to spread the word about the upcoming release to get as many\neyes as possible on it, and let’s blast through the next phase of the project.\nThe best is yet to come and it starts on the 29th of this month!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Notably interesting\nis the new addition of the governance module on testnet, we encourage you to\ncheck it out!\n\nIf you encounter any problem while testing this new version of Particl V3 or\nhave feedback to give, please add a \"new issue\" on Github (click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new/choose]). Make sure to\nexplain in detail the problem you’ve encountered, how to reproduce it, and the\nOS you’re using.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground.\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nChangelog\nWhat follows is a list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements made to Particl\nV3 since the last testnet release. This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nGovernance Module\n * Enable the governance module for testing.\n * Fixed an issue where graphs were not displaying in release builds.\n\nMarket Module\n * Publishing fee estimates now correctly include the image fees.\n * Filtering for expired listings in Sell > Listings page now works correctly.\n * A warning is now displayed when there may be insufficient utxos (but\n   sufficient total funds) to publish a listing AND all its images. The ability\n   to still continue with the publish is possible, but requires the seller to\n   explicitly indicate that this is acceptable.\n * Updated the csv product import functionality to attempt to match on country\n   name (English only for now) instead of just the ISO code.\n * The csv product import now allows for specifying the \"shipping to\"\n   destinations countries in a comma separated list.\n * The market summary text of a market shown in the Joined Markets section is\n   now selectable.\n * Includes changes made to particl-marketplace service such as...\n * Fixed an error that prevented a bid from being placed if all the images of\n   the item in question had not been properly received.\n * Fixed an error that caused the buyflow to become stuck due to the buyer\n   cancelling the purchase arrangement but the seller completing the escrow\n   state prior to receiving the cancellation action.\n * The particl-marketplace service now has some time on termination to attempt\n   to gracefully shut itself down, instead of terminating processing immediately\n   (and potentially causing issues with the processing of messages).\n * Remove the lookup for an existing \"market\" named wallet to create the initial\n   profile/identity wallets from when initializing the service for the first\n   time: this potentially causes errors and requires manual user intervention if\n   the named \"market\" wallet is encrypted and locked during the service\n   initialization.\n\nWallet Module\n * Updated the zap functionality (cold staking) to cater to additional user\n   options.\n * Changed wording on the transaction table entries to make more sense when fees\n   are involved: this includes fees paid for smsg fees (eg: publishing listings\n   via smsg) and zap transaction fees.\n * The restore wallet flow now caters to 12 word mnemonic inputs.\n\nGeneral\n * Added additional messages to message of the day.\n * Spelling and other grammar updates.\n * Update and unify usage of the zmq library dependency.\n * Application crashes should now be handled correctly: instead of receiving a\n   nasty JS error prompt, the error is logged and a friendlier window is\n   displayed indicating that the application has crashed. This is a temporary\n   stopgap change that leads into better logging and user visibility into what\n   the application is doing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and assistance in testing this new version of Particl\nV3.

It introduces a significant update to the cold staking \"zap\"\nscript, hardware wallet support for Trezor devices, as well as a good variety of\nimprovements and minor fixes.\n\n * Download link: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.13 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213Hashes1d43c6f75af5daefdde50376f2cbe4e38a4683e288bbe37c9fadf9aff76ff282\nparticl-0.19.2.13-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13]As always, we\nhighly recommend keeping your node(s) and wallet(s) up-to-date with Particl's\nlatest version. If you're using the cold staking application Partyman, you can\nupdate by entering the partyman/partyman update command from your home folder or \n./partyman update from inside your partyman folder.\n\nYou can verify the full list of additions by checking out the release notes\nhere: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCold Staking \"Zap\" Feature Update\nThe zap feature lets you delegate the entirety of your staking outputs to an\nexternal cold staking node. While it has been available for several years, this\nParticl Core update improves its behavior and adds to it a new, very useful\nfeature.\n\nIndeed, it is now possible to choose whether you want your zap to be more\nprivate (doesn't use and mix inputs from different addresses in a single zapping\ntransaction) or instantly get optimal staking performances (default behavior). \n\nIt is currently possible to use the improved zap feature on Particl Core\n(although not directly supported in Particl Qt's wallet interface), but it will\nonly be available on Particl Desktop on the mainnet release of Particl V3.\nPrevious versions of Particl Desktop still work using the older version of the\nzap feature.\n\nIf you want to use the zap script without Particl Desktop, you can use this\nscript that is available on Github: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl_scripts/blob/main/zap.py.\n\nHardware Support for Trezor Devices \nThis Particl Core update also adds support for Trezor devices. Please note that\nour integration is not yet officially supported by Trezor itself, but the new\ncore update provides the code required for it.\n\nThe implementation supports incoming blind (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions,\nmeaning you'll be able to privately send your funds to your device using\nhardware hardening, but without compromising your privacy while doing so. \n\nNote that, although it supports incoming privacy transactions (from an anon or\nblind balance to a public balance), the Trezor implementation will itself only\nsupport public balances, at least for the initial implementation.\n\nWe will communicate more details about official support from Trezor as soon as\nwe can!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core 0.22 Coming Soon!\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert has been catching up with Bitcoin's codebase\nat lightning-fast pace. In fact, Particl Core has, as of today, caught up to\nBitcoin's 0.22 code.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\n[Governance module] Introduces a new governance module that allows for viewing\nactive and upcoming CCS proposals that require a network vote, as well as past\nproposals. Voting on a current or future proposal is currently available,\nalthough not enabled when using a cold staking wallet (the vote should rather be\ncast on the cold staking node). Further, detailed information on the proposals\nand how to vote is included in the module. While the governance module is\nincluded in this release, it has been temporarily disabled - this is not a bug\n\n[Market module] Removes the unused and invalid publishing controls in the\nproduct import wizard.\n\n[Market module] Images are displayed alongside the market name, if available, in\nadditional places in the product creation and publishing areas.\n\n[Market module] Removes the display of a 'ROOT' parent category that was\ndisplayed on items in the cart.\n\n[Market module] Replaces usage of the word 'bid' with 'order request' and\n'order' where appropriate, to avoid confusion ('bid' terminology is confusing,\nwith 'order request' more accurately aligning with the behaviour).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error in the GUI preventing the joining of a market\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n[Market module] When a listing item is flagged, all exact duplicates of the\nlisting item in the same market are now flagged as well. When a new duplicate of\nan already flagged item is received for the same market, it will be flagged as\nwell.\n\n[Market module] Fixes a case in the Listing Details where action buttons were\nnot disabling correctly when another action is being processed and taking some\ntime to complete.\n\n[Market module] Adds the ability to export to CSV a list of sell orders. The\nsell orders exported are those currently displayed; sell orders exported are\ninfluenced by any search and filtering criteria applied).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an issue preventing publishing items to a market with a 0\nvalue for either of the shipping prices.\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error whereby the wrong favorite item may be removed\nwhile attempting to remove a favorite item.\n\n[Market module] Reduces the number of stealth addresses used per wallet/identity\nthroughout the marketplace.\n\n[Market module] Adds additional validation to market message order sequencing.\n\n[Wallet module] Prevents the user from navigating to another app/module in\ncertain steps of the wallet creation: this prevents issues with potentially\nusing an uninitialized wallet in other app/module (i.e., the Governance module).\n\n[General] Fixes the zmq.node error on some versions of Windows that prevented\nthe application from opening.\n\n[General] Attempts a fix at a possible intermittent issue where the connection\nevent may not be properly processed and thus the application fails to start\ncorrectly. Further testing and feedback may be necessary.\n\n[General] Display a random \"message of the day\" on the welcome screen. The\ncurrent number of messages is limited, but can be added to in the future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf this testing round goes well and no other major issue is identified in the\nnext couple of days, Particl V3 will be ready for mainnet very shortly. We will\nclearly communicate the mainnet release date on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and within the usual communications channels.\n\nSo let's get testing and keep an eye out for the confirmation on the release\ndate very soon!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal requested 35,250 PART per month from the treasury for 6\nmonths, after which a new funding request will need to be pushed by the team and\napproved by stakeholders.\n\nWe are happy to report that Particl stakeholders have approved this proposal \nwith a solid 98.6% approval rate (minimum required was 60%) and a 64%\nparticipation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 5,040 blocks,\nwith 3,191 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 46 voting against it.\n\nWhen Will the Team Start Claiming Funds\nWith the funding request now approved, the team can now claim funds from the\ntreasury according to its stated schedule. However, because the new treasury\nmodel has just gone live today (read the Hardfork Successful\n[https://particl.news/july-2021-hardfork-successful/] blog post for more\ndetails), which is in the middle of July, the team will only start claiming\nfunds at the end of August. That means that the first month out of the six\nrequested by the team’s funding request will be August. The proposal then\nexpires after the month of January 2022, which is the last month out of the six\nwhere the Particl team will claim funds. A new funding request will then be\npublished and will need to be approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nIn the meantime, the team will use the remaining days of July to finalize the\ndeployment of the new legal entity, finish up the new website, and get\neverything ready for August and onward. Within that period, the team will also\nprepare the new roadmap for public release and explain, in detail, the reasoning\nbehind it and the objectives that motivate it. Spoiler alert, it is simply\namazing, and we can’t wait to share it with you all!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You For Your Trust\nThis particular proposal was the first-ever funding request for the new treasury\nmodel. Because the community entirely owns the treasury’s fund, this proposal\nasked for much more than just coins to support the project; it asked for the\ncommunity’s trust and stamp of approval.\n\nWith this in mind, we want to thank every one of you in the community for this\nvote of confidence and for participating in this democratic exercise. We are all\nvery excited to move past the mainnet release of Particl V3 and get down to some\nserious business!\n\nLet’s take Particl to the literal next level and deliver to the world a truly\ndecentralized, private, secure, and free e-commerce platform that is easy to\nuse.

This is a very important milestone for Particl as the\nhardfork introduces various changes and re-enables the ability to conduct blind\nand anon transactions.\n\nThis blog post will summarize everything brought by the hardfork and provide an\nupdate on the claims submitted by users who had coins temporarily disabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Has Hardforked\nToday, on Monday the 12th of July, 2021, at 17:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain\nhas successfully hardforked. This event officially turns the page on the\nunfortunate exploit on the chain that led to the creation of fraudulent coins\nout of thin air.\n\nFor an overview of the exploit and its disclosure, please head over to this\nParticl News blog post [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/].\nFor a summary of the solutions that have been deployed, please check out this\none [https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\n> Note: If your Particl Core node is not updated to Particl Core 0.19.2.12, then\nit means you are now staking on the wrong chain. Any staking reward earned on\nthe wrong chain won't count on the correct chain, and you won't be able to send\nor receive payments from other people. Updating to Particl Core 0.19.2.12 is\nmandatory.\nBlind and Anon Transactions Re-Enabled\nOne of the two main components of this hardfork is the re-enabling of blind and\nanon transactions. In addition, the hardfork also re-enables the majority of\nanon and blind balances that were temporarily disabled to stop the attacker from\ncausing further damage on the blockchain.\n\nIn other words, you can now freely make blind and anon transactions once again\nand use Particl Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2. The hardfork also enables\nParticl V3 to go live on mainnnet as it relies on blind and anon transactions.\nMore details on this very soon!\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Low Pass Filter\nIf you had coins on blind and/or anon balances when the vulnerability was\nannounced and fixed, then they have been temporarily disabled up until today. To\nre-enable them, the Particl team deployed a “low pass filter” which\nautomatically re-enables any output with 200 or fewer coins.\n\nTo re-enable temporarily disabled coins using the low pass filter, you will need\nto enter the following command, once for every disabled output, in your Particl\nclient’s debug window.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 220 disabled coins separated into two 110 PART outputs,\nyou will need to enter the above command twice in a row. You need to use Particl\nCore 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Manual Claim Process\nIf you have disabled blind and anon outputs that contain more than 200 coins,\nyou were required to manually submit a claim to the team to include it in the\nwhitelist. If that’s your case, and you’ve submitted a claim, then your outputs\nhave been whitelisted, and you can now spend them. To do just that, you will\nneed to follow the same step as with the low pass filter.\n\nFor every disabled output you have, you need to type in the following command.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 1,000 coins that are currently disabled, spread into 4\noutputs of 250 PART each, you will need to type the above command 4 times. You\nneed to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nManual Claim Process Update\nTo be as transparent as possible, we’d like to provide a full update on the\nmanual claim process and its impact on Particl’s circulating supply.\n\nThroughout the entire span of the claim process, a total of 12 claims have been\nsubmitted to the team. Each claim has been thoroughly inspected and audited. We\nare happy to say that all submitted claims appear legitimate and that none of\nthem traced back to fraudulent or suspicious outputs. The submitted claims\neither traced back to their public origin, were accompanied by a proof of\npurchase, or had the typical cryptography one would expect from legitimate\noutputs.\n\nFor this reason, all claims been approved by both the team and the community\ngroup of validators. This claim process results in an additional\n810,588.43967605 PART being added to the supply, bringing it to a current total\nof ~11,411,000 PART. This doesn’t take any coin re-enabled through the low pass\nfilter into account.\n\n> Note: Particl’s block explorer [https://explorer.particl.io/status] currently\ndisplays a smaller circulating supply value than what is stated above. That’s\nbecause it doesn’t see disabled coins from users who haven’t yet executed the\ncommand to re-enable them. Every time users manually re-enable their coins, the\nblock explorer will dynamically adjust its circulating supply value.\nNew Treasury Model is Live\nThe second principal component of this hardfork is the activation of Particl’s\nnew and decentralized treasury model, which provides the ecosystem with\nperpetual PART revenue. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/] for more details.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]As a\nresult of this successful hardfork, anyone can now submit funding requests on\nParticl’s CCS platform to fund and support initiatives that directly benefit the\necosystem. Any funding request has to be approved by Particl stakeholders\nthrough an on-chain vote for the funds to be allocated from the treasury.\n\nIf you want to submit a proposal, please head over to the CCS platform\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] and read the instructions provided on there.\n\nIncrease in Staking Rewards\nAs part of the new treasury model, staking rewards are also getting a bump.\nIndeed, as of today, Particl’s emission rate has increased from 2% per year to\n8%, with half of the rewards going directly into the Treasury Fund.\n\nThat means that, as an individual staker, your staking rewards double from 2%\nper year to a minimum of 4%. But, of course, the actual yield rewarded to you\nfrom staking PART varies depending on how many more PART coins are being staked\nby other people. If, for example, only 50% of all PART coins stake on the\nnetwork, then you can expect your annual returns to be closer to 8% than 4%. You\ncan use CryptoID’s useful extraction tool\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!extraction] to track the percentage of all\nPART coins being staked by their owner.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would like to thank you all for your incredible support and\nunderstanding through this challenging series of events. As we officially turn\nthe page on the vulnerability exploit with the hardfork, the team is excited to\nmove forward once again and spend its time growing and promoting the Particl\necosystem.\n\nStay tuned as we near the mainnet release of Particl V3 and soon release a bunch\nof exciting news, including the new roadmap, on Particl News.\n\nWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and that’s precisely the case here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Particl Core 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12], which is now\nreleased in full, is the client that activates the hardfork. Exchanges have been\ncontacted, and have agreed to go ahead with the hardfork as planned.\n\nThis marks an important milestone for Particl as it turns the page on the\ninflationary bug discovered earlier this year and deploys the new decentralized\ntreasury model to fund and support the Particl ecosystem.\n\n> Note 1: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] if you haven’t\nalready done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will lead you to\nconnect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other people will\nnot be relayed, and you won’t be able to use anon/blind balances or Particl\nMarketplace.\n> Note 2: If you are casting your vote for the proposal currently going through\nits voting period (the first team funding request\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-vote-scheduled/]), then that means\nthat you are already using Particl Core 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If that's the\ncase, there is nothing more for you to do, you're already all set!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s this Hardfork About?\nThis coming hardfork, scheduled for the 12th of July, 2021 at 17:00 UTC and\nactivated by Particl Core 0.19.2.12, has two primary purposes.\n\nRe-Enabling Temporarily Disabled Anon and Blind Balances\nParticl Vulnerability DisclosureLearn everything about Particl’s recent\nvulnerability discovery and emergency hardfork.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]The Particl team\nnoticed, in February 2021, a discrepancy between the expected and the observed\nsupply. Indeed, it was found that there were more coins in circulation than\nthere should.\n\nThe team immediately investigated the situation and discovered that an attacker\nhad exploited the chain. This allowed a hacker to create a certain number of\ncoins out of thin air to sell them on the trading markets. The bug that made\nthis possible was located and fixed in an emergency hardfork, leading to anon\nand blind balances being temporarily disabled.\n\nThe hardfork re-enables legitimate anon and blind balances while keeping\nexploited ones disabled.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model Activation\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]\nAdditionally, the Particl community recently approved a new treasury model to\nprovide the ecosystem with a decentralized and perpetual source of PART income.\nThis allows anyone to create and publish proposals on the CCS platform and get\ntheir initiative(s) funded if approved by the community through an on-chain\nvote.\n\nThe hardfork activates this new treasury model live on mainnet.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and land on the proper chain, all\nyou need to do is update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.12 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212Hashes8381f9a3f00c4515c32f87d9a66cc04ce3de2ad1aad95171e7c4cd99d91b46dc\nparticl-0.19.2.12-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] * Download\n   link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12\n\nThis version is already live, as a full release, and you can download it\ndirectly on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If you are\ncold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, simply enter\nthis command to update your node: cd ~/partyman && ./partyman update.\n\nOnce you’ve updated your node, you don’t need to do anything else. You’ll\nhardfork on the 12th of July, at 17:00 UTC, with the rest of the network. The\nhardfork is an entirely automatic process as long as you’re running the correct\ncore version.\n\nAnything Else Included in the Hardfork?\nThe two main items of this hardfork have been detailed in the first section of\nthis blog post, after the introduction. However, a few other minor items are\nincluded, which are available in the release notes of Particl Core 0.19.2.12.\nYou can simply follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212] \nto get the full list of additions included in this release.\n\nMaking Particl V3’s Mainnet Release Possible\nAn important but indirect result of this hardfork is that it will make the\nmainnet release of Particl V3 possible. Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on\nmainnet up until the hardfork.\n\nThat’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client,\nuses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling\nescrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind\nbalances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.\n\nAs the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and\nthus able to be released on mainnet.\n\nAs an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one\nweek after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3\nrelease ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as\nsmoothly as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and\nwants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through\nthis unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are\nincredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the\nParticl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.\n\nFollowing the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new\npost-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the\necosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.\n\nWe cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized\ne-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience! So stay awesome, and let’s rock the\nmonths and years to come, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on mainnet up until the hardfork.</p><p>That’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client, uses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling escrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind balances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.</p><p>As the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and thus able to be released on mainnet.</p><p>As an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one week after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3 release ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as smoothly as possible.</p><hr><p>The entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and wants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through this unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are incredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the Particl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.</p><p>Following the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new post-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the ecosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.</p><p>We cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized e-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience!

It requests\n35,250 PART per month from the treasury fund for a period of 6 months only\nafter\nwhich the team will submit a new funding...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]Over the past few weeks, the Particl team has proposed an out-of-the-box\nstrategy to fund the development and expansion of the Particl ecosystem and the\nteam’s operations [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/].\n\nThe strategy consists of a new decentralized treasury model that gets\nautomatically funded by the protocol using a portion of the network’s staking\nrewards. Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then\nsubmit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the\ntreasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote. This\nprovides the Particl ecosystem with an adequate PART income source intended to\nsupport and enhance the Particl project.\n\nFor a project, idea, or initiative to be funded from the Treasury Fund, it needs\nto be first published on the CCS platform as a proposal, and then, go through an\non-chain voting round. That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing\nits funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds\nthat will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related\noperations for a duration of 6 months.\n\nParticl Team’s Funding Request\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250\nPART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this\nperiod expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to\npublish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\nAlthough this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring\nmore financial stability and security to the project.\n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide\nfunding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different\npurposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended\nto be split.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0),\n   BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities.\n * Management, legal, and administration (8%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (12%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange\n   listing budgets.\n\nThe Team's Vision Moving Forward\nIn the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount\nof capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on\ndevelopment. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl\nMarketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking,\nand the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.\n\nOther areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and\ncommunity growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to\nthese areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s\nprecisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.\n\nMore Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth\nParticl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its\nblockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the\nway they deserve. That’s all about to change!\n\nAs part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed\nfrom the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives\naimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will\nestablish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.\n\nAdditionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and\nis scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.\n\nSupporting and Expanding the Team\nFor the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal\nrestructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized\ntreasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we\nhave identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have\nworked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding\nallows it.\n\nThis restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership,\ncommunications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic\nobjectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.\n\nAt the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members\nto be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.\n\n * Cryptoguard — Project management and communications\n * Gerlof van Ek (crz) — Project and development management, Lead Designer,\n   UI/UX, and front-end developer\n * Imran — Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships\n * Henk Swardt — Development management and coordinator\n * Tecnovert — Lead core developer\n * Arnold Bansemer — Lead desktop developer\n * Kewde — Marketplace developer, OMP, and core\n * Juha Kovanen — Marketplace developer\n * Martin — UI & UX integration and front-end developer\n * Dros — Marketing, branding, and business research & development\n * Dasource — Technical research & development\n\nNote: More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents\nthe current situation at the time of writing this blog post.\n\nTeam Expansion\nFunding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A\ngreater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or\ncontracting work with partners.\n\nThe expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically\ndeployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.\n\nAdditionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its\nadvisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.\n\nEncouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions\nAlthough the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its\noperations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led\ngovernance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its\nlevel of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led\ninitiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.\n\nTo that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools,\ndocumentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new\nideas and projects.\n\nBudgets and Expenses\nInfrastructure Expenses\n“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to\nassure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited\nto, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain\nregistrations, server maintenance, etc. \n\nAt the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a\npersonal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are\nintended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off\nindividual team members.\n\nBudgets\n\n“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that\nthe team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl\necosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not\ninclude team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.\n\nMarketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)\n\n * Content Creation, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube,\n   social media channels, and other mediums.\n * Digital Ads, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e.,\n   Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.\n * Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program, to grow the number of active vendors\n   on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.\n\nMarketing Funds (Event-based)\n\n * Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards, to help grow the project with new\n   members/users and keep things interesting within the community.\n * Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, to increase Particl’s exposure by\n   leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).\n * Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns, to increase Particl’s exposure in\n   blockchain and technology-related media.\n * Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), to increase\n   Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.\n\nExchange Listings and Partnerships Fund\n\n * Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, to get Particl listed on\n   quality exchanges and other third-party services.\n * Partnership and team collaboration funds, to ease the establishment of\n   partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.\n\nLegal Fund\n\n * Legal costs, to pay for any required legal services.\n * Corporate fees, to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.\n\nEach month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the\nParticl team from the treasury model.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific\nbudget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for\nexample, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that\nprecisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will\nremain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that\nspecific budget to be used later on, as needed.\n\nAlthough these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as\nwe progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the\nnumber of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly\nreviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward.\nNew budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team\nwants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation\nand to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.\n\nThe Reserve Fund\nAny extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries,\nexpenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This\nincludes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources\nof income for the team.\n\nThis Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against\nsudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is\nexpected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing\nsafety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.\n\nA New Legal Entity to Support the Project\nTo support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with\nany legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly\njurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over\nthe previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug,\nSwitzerland.\n\n * A more flexible legal entity operating within a well-respected and\n   pro-blockchain jurisdiction.\n * Clear and progressive legal guidance for blockchain and cryptocurrency\n   projects.\n * More financially efficient structure with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller\n   monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.\n\nThis new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such\nas acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges),\nholding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury,\nemitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments\n(i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases\n(i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.\n\nThe Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed\nagreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set\nup the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new\nlegal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal\nends so that the project can move forward swiftly.\n\nNote: The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not\nresponsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.\n\nLet’s Summarize\nThere’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this\nproposal gets you.\n\n * Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more\n   defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings\n   overall quality improvement in all business areas.\n * Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will\n   significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.\n * Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development,\n   marketing, legal, business, etc.\n * New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing\n   on the products and their benefits.\n * Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors\n   and customers.\n * Commitment to grow the user base and community.\n * Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges,\n   third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.\n\nWith the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the\nParticl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make\nit stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the\nParticl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of\nmarketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following \nthis link [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]. \n\nThe proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so\nplease leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or\ncomment.

Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then submit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the treasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote.

That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing its funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds that will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related operations for a duration of 6 months.</p><h2 id=\"particl-team-s-funding-request\">Particl Team’s Funding Request</h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>This funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1. Although this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring more financial stability and security to the project.</p><p>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide funding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\">Funding Distribution Breakdown</h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended to be split.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (8%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (12%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange listing budgets.</li></ul><h2 id=\"the-team-s-vision-moving-forward\">The Team's Vision Moving Forward</h2><p>In the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount of capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on development. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl Marketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking, and the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.</p><p>Other areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and community growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to these areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s precisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.</p><h3 id=\"more-focus-on-promoting-particl-s-awesome-products-and-growth\">More Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth</h3><p>Particl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its blockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the way they deserve. That’s all about to change!</p><p>As part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed from the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives aimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will establish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.</p><p>Additionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and is scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.</p><h2 id=\"supporting-and-expanding-the-team\">Supporting and Expanding the Team</h2><p>For the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal restructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized treasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we have identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have worked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding allows it.</p><p>This restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership, communications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic objectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members to be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Cryptoguard </strong>— Project management and communications</li><li><strong>Gerlof van Ek (crz) </strong>— Project and development management, Lead Designer, UI/UX, and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Imran </strong>— Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships</li><li><strong>Henk Swardt</strong> — Development management and coordinator</li><li><strong>Tecnovert </strong>— Lead core developer</li><li><strong>Arnold Bansemer </strong>— Lead desktop developer</li><li><strong>Kewde </strong>— Marketplace developer, OMP, and core</li><li><strong>Juha Kovanen </strong>— Marketplace developer</li><li><strong>Martin </strong>— UI &amp; UX integration and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Dros</strong> — Marketing, branding, and business research &amp; development</li><li><strong>Dasource</strong> — Technical research &amp; development</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents the current situation at the time of writing this blog post.</em></p><h3 id=\"team-expansion\">Team Expansion</h3><p>Funding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A greater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or contracting work with partners.</p><p>The expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically deployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.</p><p>Additionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its advisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.</p><h3 id=\"encouraging-and-stimulating-third-party-contributions\">Encouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions</h3><p>Although the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its operations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led governance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its level of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led initiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.</p><p>To that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools, documentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new ideas and projects.</p><h2 id=\"budgets-and-expenses\">Budgets and Expenses</h2><h3 id=\"infrastructure-expenses\"><strong>Infrastructure Expenses</strong></h3><p>“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to assure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited to, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain registrations, server maintenance, etc. </p><p>At the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a personal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are intended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off individual team members.</p><p><strong>Budgets</strong></p><p>“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that the team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not include team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.</p><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube, social media channels, and other mediums.</li><li><strong>Digital Ads</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e., Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.</li><li><strong>Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program</strong>, to grow the number of active vendors on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Event-based)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards</strong>, to help grow the project with new members/users and keep things interesting within the community.</li><li><strong>Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure by leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).</li><li><strong>Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in blockchain and technology-related media.</li><li><strong>Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.</li></ul><p><strong>Exchange Listings and Partnerships Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, </strong></strong></strong>to get Particl listed on quality exchanges and other third-party services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Partnership and team collaboration funds, </strong></strong></strong>to ease the establishment of partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Legal </strong></strong>costs<strong><strong>,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any required legal services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Corporate fees,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.</li></ul><p>Each month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the Particl team from the treasury model.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific budget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for example, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that precisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will remain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that specific budget to be used later on, as needed.</p><p>Although these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as we progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the number of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly reviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward. New budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team wants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation and to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.</p><h3 id=\"the-reserve-fund\"><strong>The Reserve Fund</strong></h3><p>Any extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries, expenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This includes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources of income for the team.</p><p>This Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against sudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is expected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing safety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-legal-entity-to-support-the-project\">A New Legal Entity to Support the Project</h2><p>To support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with any legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over the previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug, Switzerland.</p><ul><li>A <strong>more flexible</strong> legal entity operating within a well-respected and pro-blockchain jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Clear and progressive legal guidance</strong> for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.</li><li><strong>More financially efficient structure </strong>with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.</li></ul><p>This new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such as acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges), holding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury, emitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments (i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases (i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.</p><p>The Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed agreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set up the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new legal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal ends so that the project can move forward swiftly.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not responsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.</em></p><h1 id=\"let-s-summarize\"><strong>Let’s Summarize</strong></h1><p>There’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this proposal gets you.</p><ul><li>Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings overall quality improvement in all business areas.</li><li>Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.</li><li>Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development, marketing, legal, business, etc.</li><li>New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing on the products and their benefits.</li><li>Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors and customers.</li><li>Commitment to grow the user base and community.</li><li>Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges, third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.</li></ul><p>With the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the Particl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make it stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the Particl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of marketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.</p><hr><p>To read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9\">this link</a></strong>. </p><p>The proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so please leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or comment. As always, the schedule for this proposal’s voting period will be clearly announced a few days before it starts on all the usual Particl channels.</p><p>We hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the potential to significantly change things around by giving you, as a stakeholder of Particl, tremendous value. Let it be the trigger that lights the spark for the Particl ecosystem, giving it the needed exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce that it deserves.</p><p>Be a part and cast your vote on this pivotal proposal!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

This led to clear strategic objectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members to be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Cryptoguard </strong>— Project management and communications</li><li><strong>Gerlof van Ek (crz) </strong>— Project and development management, Lead Designer, UI/UX, and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Imran </strong>— Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships</li><li><strong>Henk Swardt</strong> — Development management and coordinator</li><li><strong>Tecnovert </strong>— Lead core developer</li><li><strong>Arnold Bansemer </strong>— Lead desktop developer</li><li><strong>Kewde </strong>— Marketplace developer, OMP, and core</li><li><strong>Juha Kovanen </strong>— Marketplace developer</li><li><strong>Martin </strong>— UI &#x26; UX integration and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Dros</strong> — Marketing, branding, and business research &#x26; development</li><li><strong>Dasource</strong> — Technical research &#x26; development</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents the current situation at the time of writing this blog post.</em></p><h3 id=\"team-expansion\">Team Expansion</h3><p>Funding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A greater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or contracting work with partners.</p><p>The expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically deployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.</p><p>Additionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its advisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.</p><h3 id=\"encouraging-and-stimulating-third-party-contributions\">Encouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions</h3><p>Although the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its operations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led governance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its level of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led initiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.</p><p>To that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools, documentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new ideas and projects.</p><h2 id=\"budgets-and-expenses\">Budgets and Expenses</h2><h3 id=\"infrastructure-expenses\"><strong>Infrastructure Expenses</strong></h3><p>“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to assure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited to, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain registrations, server maintenance, etc. </p><p>At the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a personal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are intended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off individual team members.</p><p><strong>Budgets</strong></p><p>“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that the team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not include team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.</p><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube, social media channels, and other mediums.</li><li><strong>Digital Ads</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e., Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.</li><li><strong>Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program</strong>, to grow the number of active vendors on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Event-based)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards</strong>, to help grow the project with new members/users and keep things interesting within the community.</li><li><strong>Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure by leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).</li><li><strong>Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in blockchain and technology-related media.</li><li><strong>Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.</li></ul><p><strong>Exchange Listings and Partnerships Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, </strong></strong></strong>to get Particl listed on quality exchanges and other third-party services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Partnership and team collaboration funds, </strong></strong></strong>to ease the establishment of partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Legal </strong></strong>costs<strong><strong>,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any required legal services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Corporate fees,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.</li></ul><p>Each month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the Particl team from the treasury model.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific budget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for example, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that precisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will remain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that specific budget to be used later on, as needed.</p><p>Although these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as we progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the number of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly reviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward. New budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team wants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation and to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.</p><h3 id=\"the-reserve-fund\"><strong>The Reserve Fund</strong></h3><p>Any extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries, expenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This includes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources of income for the team.</p><p>This Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against sudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is expected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing safety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-legal-entity-to-support-the-project\">A New Legal Entity to Support the Project</h2><p>To support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with any legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over the previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug, Switzerland.</p><ul><li>A <strong>more flexible</strong> legal entity operating within a well-respected and pro-blockchain jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Clear and progressive legal guidance</strong> for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.</li><li><strong>More financially efficient structure </strong>with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.</li></ul><p>This new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such as acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges), holding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury, emitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments (i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases (i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.</p><p>The Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed agreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set up the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new legal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal ends so that the project can move forward swiftly.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not responsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.</em></p><h1 id=\"let-s-summarize\"><strong>Let’s Summarize</strong></h1><p>There’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this proposal gets you.</p><ul><li>Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings overall quality improvement in all business areas.</li><li>Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.</li><li>Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development, marketing, legal, business, etc.</li><li>New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing on the products and their benefits.</li><li>Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors and customers.</li><li>Commitment to grow the user base and community.</li><li>Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges, third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.</li></ul><p>With the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the Particl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make it stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the Particl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of marketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.</p><hr><p>To read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9\">this link</a></strong>. </p><p>The proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so please leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or comment. As always, the schedule for this proposal’s voting period will be clearly announced a few days before it starts on all the usual Particl channels.</p><p>We hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the potential to significantly change things around by giving you, as a stakeholder of Particl, tremendous value.

This marks a significant moment in Particl history as the end\nresult is a new, more powerful self-funding mechanism for the ecosystem.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go through the timeline for the\ncoming weeks as the new decentralized treasury makes its way on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nThe Decentralized Treasury Proposal vote, the first-ever “protocol consensus\nchanging vote”, was an important milestone for Particl because it proposed\napplying critical changes to the protocol. Indeed, the proposal suggested\nraising the yearly PART coin emission rate from 2% to 8%, with half of the\nstaking rewards being automatically deposited into a treasury fund by the\nprotocol.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mind-blowing 96.6% approval rate (minimum required was 75%) and a \n70.6% participation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 10,080\nblocks, with 6,884 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 239 voting\nagainst it.\n\nThe participation rate for this voting round increased by ~7% compared to the\nprevious (and first) proposal that required a vote. This is an incredibly\nencouraging news in light of Particl’s transition into a community governed\nproject and shows just how active its stakeholders are.\n\nWhen Will it Go Live?\nNow that the results are official and that the decentralized treasury model has\nbeen approved, it can now be deployed on the Particl blockchain. For this to\nhappen requires a hardfork which relies on two deliverables.\n\nThe first one is, obviously, the integration of the decentralized treasury code\ninto the blockchain. The code for the changes has been completed and the build\nis now going through a thorough testing process on a side network (Particl clone\nnetwork).\n\nThe second deliverable is the integration of the output whitelist into the\nblockchain. This is tied to the output claim process which is currently ongoing.\nAs a reminder, the pre-fork process ends on June 21st, 2021. If you want your\ntemporarily disabled anon and blind outputs to be re-enabled in the coming\nhardfork, make sure you’ve read read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/] and submit your claim\nbefore that date, if needed.\n\nOnce the cutoff date of the claim period is reached, the final pre-fork output\nwhitelist will be bundled with the next Particl Core release and be submitted to\nexchanges so they can start the process of preparing for the coming hardfork. \n\nIf all goes well, Particl should be forking on the 12th of July, 2021. This is\ncurrently a target, the actual hardfork may happen a bit before or after,\ndepending on how fast exchanges and partners get ready for the fork. As always,\nwe will keep you updated with any news on the regard.\n\nThe Team Funding Proposal Goes Live Early This Week\nPutting in place a decentralized treasury model was only a first step in funding\nback the current Particl team. The second step is another proposal that will\nrequest capital from the treasury fund to fund the team and its operations. This\nproposal isn’t unlike what anyone else in the community can bring forward, but\nit’ll be Particl’s first-ever proposal to request resources from the treasury\nfund.\n\nThe proposal will detail the team’s strategy moving forward and will explain how\nit intends on utilizing the funds it is claiming. The proposal will be published\nand begin its discussion phase in the early moments of the week, on the CCS\nplatform. Make sure to be around if you want to provide comments and feedback on\nthe team proposal!\n\nNow’s the Best Time to Get Involved\nNow that the decentralized treasury model is about to go live on mainnet, you\ncan prepare your proposals and get them ready to be published. If, in the past,\nyou’ve had projects or ideas for Particl but couldn’t get the required capital\nto start them up, you now possess all you need to overcome that hurdle.\n\nBecause every submitted proposal first requires a discussion phase, and then a\nvoting phase of a minimum of one week, don’t hesitate to let the community about\nyour idea as soon as possible. This would ensure that the ecosystem and treasury\nfund get used right from the start and that no time is wasted before this new\naddition to the protocol starts benefiting the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is very excited about the new decentralized treasury\nmodel and can’t wait to see what you all come up with in terms of initiatives,\nprojects, businesses, and services. Particl now possesses the tools and\nresources to make anything happen; the sky is now the limit. It is now up to\neach and every one of us, the Particl community members, to make Particl a\nresounding success. So LFG!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

You can now submit your anon and blind outputs\nto the Particl team to re-activate your temporarily disabled coins.\n\nThis blog post details how to submit your claim to the team and provides all the\ninformation you need to know about it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is the Output Claim Process?\nA few months ago, the Particl team discovered and fixed a vulnerability in the\ncode that allowed an attacker to exploit RingCT transactions to create PART\ncoins out of thin air.\n\nTo remedy the situation, the Particl team proceeded to an emergency hardfork and\nset in motion a contingency plan to stop the attacker from doing more damage. As\na result, all coins stored on anon and blind balances have been temporarily\ndisabled.\n\nThe Output Claim Process is how you can submit a claim to the team so that your\ndisabled coins can be re-enabled when the coming hardfork goes live.\n\nFor more information on the exploit, you can refer to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. For a deeper\nexplanation of the solutions deployed, you can refer to this one\n[https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\nSeparate Process From the “Low-Pass Filter”\nTo re-enable anon and blind coins that are temporarily disabled, the team\ndeployed two separate solutions; the Output Claim Process, which this blog post\nis about, and a low-pass filter.\n\nThe low-pass filter is a function that will be enabled on the day of the coming\nhardfork. It will let you re-enable any anon or blind outputs equal to or lower\nthan 200 coins yourself, without the help of the Particl team. In other words,\nif your outputs contain a number of coins equal to or lower than 200, then you\ndon’t need to go through this Output Claim Process and submit a claim to the\nteam to re-enable them.\n\nRequirements to Qualify for the Output Claim Process\nTo qualify for the Output Claim Process, you need to have (1) blind or anon\noutputs containing disabled coins and (2) at least one blind or anon balance\ncontaining more than 200 coins.\n\nHow to Submit Your Claim\n * Access the output claim portal here\n   [https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4].\n\nThe Output Claim Process is powered by the Jira platform.

It is,\nhowever, important to be aware that it is separated into two phases; the\npre-fork and post-fork phases.\n\nIf you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June,\n2021), then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your\ncurrently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies\nthat your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nKeep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance\nbefore the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the\nactual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase\nis roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.\n\nIf you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021), then\nyou’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs\nre-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at\nthe current time, not scheduled.\n\nOutput Activation Process\nOnce you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to\ndetermine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker. If your claim\nis approved, it will then be added to a whitelist that will specify what outputs\nwill be re-enabled on the day of the hardfork.\n\nAs this process aims to prevent the attacker from moving exploited coins after\nthe hardfork, the only criterion to have your output(s) re-enabled is that it\nnot be owned by the attacker itself.\n\nThe Particl team has developed a tracer script that can help determine whether\nor not outputs are legitimate or exploited, but in some cases, more information\nmay be required. The exact process used to validate outputs will vary on a\ncase-by-case basis depending on various factors.\n\nOnce the Particl team validates a claim, the submitted data will then be\nanonymized and passed on to a second group composed of community members tasked\nwith verifying the validated data. This process is entirely anonymous, meaning\nthe community group can't know who submitted a specific claim. It aims at\nproviding a second security layer to ensure no suspicious or contested claim\ngets approved.\n\nIf a claim would be rejected by either the Particl team or the community group,\nit’ll still be possible for the person making the claim to plead their case to\nthe community by submitting a CCS proposal of their own. Any CCS proposal\nrelated to individual claims will be required to be approved by Particl\nstakeholders through a vote.\n\nData Collection Policy\nData Sharing\nOnly team members directly involved with the Output Claim Process will have\naccess to the submitted data. The data will then be anonymized before being sent\nto the community group for the verification process. The data won't be shared\nwith team/community members not involved in the process or with any third-party. \n\n> Note: Jira is a third-party platform with access to the data uploaded to it. For\nthis reason, we highly recommend encrypting your output data file using the PGP\nkey provided above before submitting your claim.\nData Storage\nThe output data will be securely kept for some time by Particl team members\ndirectly involved with the process as that helps match and validate outputs for\nlate claims. We're looking at a period of roughly one year, after which point\nit'll be deleted entirely.\n\nWhen, exactly, the data will be deleted will be adequately communicated in\nadvance to give late claimers to submit their claims before data that could help\nthem gets deleted. \n\nKeep in mind that once a claim is validated, its associated data will be\nanonymized not to provide a link between the data and which user submitted it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow that the Output Claim Process is officially live, we're getting ready to get\nback to normal and turn the page on this unfortunate event.

As a result, all coins stored on anon and blind balances have been temporarily disabled.</p><p>The Output Claim Process is how you can submit a claim to the team so that your disabled coins can be re-enabled when the coming hardfork goes live.</p><p>For more information on the exploit, you can refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/\"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>.

It will let you re-enable any anon or blind outputs equal to or lower than 200 coins yourself, without the help of the Particl team. In other words, if your outputs contain a number of coins equal to or lower than 200, then you don’t need to go through this Output Claim Process and submit a claim to the team to re-enable them.</p><h3 id=\"requirements-to-qualify-for-the-output-claim-process\">Requirements to Qualify for the Output Claim Process</h3><p>To qualify for the Output Claim Process, you need to have <strong>(1)</strong> blind or anon outputs containing disabled coins and <strong>(2)</strong> at least one blind or anon balance containing more than 200 coins.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-submit-your-claim\">How to Submit Your Claim</h1><ul><li><strong>Access the output claim portal <a href=\"https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4\">here</a>.</strong></li></ul><p>The Output Claim Process is powered by the Jira platform.

It is, however, important to be aware that <strong>it is separated into two phases</strong>; the pre-fork and post-fork phases.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies that your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Keep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance before the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the actual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase is roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current time, not scheduled.</p><h1 id=\"output-activation-process\">Output Activation Process</h1><p>Once you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to determine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker. If your claim is approved, it will then be added to a whitelist that will specify what outputs will be re-enabled on the day of the hardfork.</p><p>As this process aims to prevent the attacker from moving exploited coins after the hardfork, the only criterion to have your output(s) re-enabled is that it not be owned by the attacker itself.</p><p>The Particl team has developed a tracer script that can help determine whether or not outputs are legitimate or exploited, but in some cases, more information may be required. The exact process used to validate outputs will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on various factors.</p><p>Once the Particl team validates a claim, the submitted data will then be anonymized and passed on to a second group composed of community members tasked with verifying the validated data. This process is entirely anonymous, meaning the community group can't know who submitted a specific claim. It aims at providing a second security layer to ensure no suspicious or contested claim gets approved.</p><p>If a claim would be rejected by either the Particl team or the community group, it’ll still be possible for the person making the claim to plead their case to the community by submitting a CCS proposal of their own. Any CCS proposal related to individual claims will be required to be approved by Particl stakeholders through a vote.</p><h1 id=\"data-collection-policy\">Data Collection Policy</h1><h3 id=\"data-sharing\">Data Sharing</h3><p>Only team members directly involved with the Output Claim Process will have access to the submitted data. The data will then be anonymized before being sent to the community group for the verification process. The data won't be shared with team/community members not involved in the process or with any third-party. </p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Jira is a third-party platform with access to the data uploaded to it. For this reason, we highly recommend encrypting your output data file using the PGP key provided above before submitting your claim.</blockquote><h3 id=\"data-storage\">Data Storage</h3><p>The output data will be securely kept for some time by Particl team members directly involved with the process as that helps match and validate outputs for late claims. We're looking at a period of roughly one year, after which point it'll be deleted entirely.</p><p>When, exactly, the data will be deleted will be adequately communicated in advance to give late claimers to submit their claims before data that could help them gets deleted. </p><p>Keep in mind that once a claim is validated, its associated data will be anonymized not to provide a link between the data and which user submitted it.</p><hr><p>Now that the Output Claim Process is officially live, we're getting ready to get back to normal and turn the page on this unfortunate event.

As a result, all coins stored on anon and blind balances have been temporarily disabled.</p><p>The Output Claim Process is how you can submit a claim to the team so that your disabled coins can be re-enabled when the coming hardfork goes live.</p><p>For more information on the exploit, you can refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/\"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>. For a deeper explanation of the solutions deployed, you can refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/\"><strong>this one</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"separate-process-from-the-low-pass-filter-\">Separate Process From the “Low-Pass Filter”</h3><p>To re-enable anon and blind coins that are temporarily disabled, <strong>the team deployed two separate solutions</strong>; the Output Claim Process, which this blog post is about, and a low-pass filter.</p><p>The low-pass filter is a function that will be enabled on the day of the coming hardfork. It will let you re-enable any anon or blind outputs equal to or lower than 200 coins yourself, without the help of the Particl team. In other words, if your outputs contain a number of coins equal to or lower than 200, then you don’t need to go through this Output Claim Process and submit a claim to the team to re-enable them.</p><h3 id=\"requirements-to-qualify-for-the-output-claim-process\">Requirements to Qualify for the Output Claim Process</h3><p>To qualify for the Output Claim Process, you need to have <strong>(1)</strong> blind or anon outputs containing disabled coins and <strong>(2)</strong> at least one blind or anon balance containing more than 200 coins.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-submit-your-claim\">How to Submit Your Claim</h1><ul><li><strong>Access the output claim portal <a href=\"https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4\">here</a>.</strong></li></ul><p>The Output Claim Process is powered by the Jira platform.

It is, however, important to be aware that <strong>it is separated into two phases</strong>; the pre-fork and post-fork phases.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies that your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Keep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance before the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the actual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase is roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current time, not scheduled.</p><h1 id=\"output-activation-process\">Output Activation Process</h1><p>Once you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to determine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker. If your claim is approved, it will then be added to a whitelist that will specify what outputs will be re-enabled on the day of the hardfork.</p><p>As this process aims to prevent the attacker from moving exploited coins after the hardfork, the only criterion to have your output(s) re-enabled is that it not be owned by the attacker itself.</p><p>The Particl team has developed a tracer script that can help determine whether or not outputs are legitimate or exploited, but in some cases, more information may be required. The exact process used to validate outputs will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on various factors.</p><p>Once the Particl team validates a claim, the submitted data will then be anonymized and passed on to a second group composed of community members tasked with verifying the validated data. This process is entirely anonymous, meaning the community group can't know who submitted a specific claim. It aims at providing a second security layer to ensure no suspicious or contested claim gets approved.</p><p>If a claim would be rejected by either the Particl team or the community group, it’ll still be possible for the person making the claim to plead their case to the community by submitting a CCS proposal of their own. Any CCS proposal related to individual claims will be required to be approved by Particl stakeholders through a vote.</p><h1 id=\"data-collection-policy\">Data Collection Policy</h1><h3 id=\"data-sharing\">Data Sharing</h3><p>Only team members directly involved with the Output Claim Process will have access to the submitted data. The data will then be anonymized before being sent to the community group for the verification process. The data won't be shared with team/community members not involved in the process or with any third-party. </p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Jira is a third-party platform with access to the data uploaded to it. For this reason, we highly recommend encrypting your output data file using the PGP key provided above before submitting your claim.</blockquote><h3 id=\"data-storage\">Data Storage</h3><p>The output data will be securely kept for some time by Particl team members directly involved with the process as that helps match and validate outputs for late claims. We're looking at a period of roughly one year, after which point it'll be deleted entirely.</p><p>When, exactly, the data will be deleted will be adequately communicated in advance to give late claimers to submit their claims before data that could help them gets deleted. </p><p>Keep in mind that once a claim is validated, its associated data will be anonymized not to provide a link between the data and which user submitted it.</p><hr><p>Now that the Output Claim Process is officially live, we're getting ready to get back to normal and turn the page on this unfortunate event.

Just like the previous vote\non the Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html], which\nended up with a fantastic participation rate, this coming voting period is going\nto be another first in Particl’s history; the first-ever protocol consensus\nchanging vote.\n\nLet’s see what that means and explore this proposal’s timeline.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal in Short\nThe Decentralized Treasury Model\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] is a critical proposal that\nsuggests modifying the blockchain parameters to ensure a self-sustainable and\nsteady source of PART income to the ecosystem. If approved, this would lead to\ncreating a Treasury Fund that would collect, at every staked block, a number of\nPART coins that can then be used by either the Particl team or the community to\nfund initiatives and projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about this proposal, you can refer directly to the proposal here\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] or read the related Particl\nNews blog post here\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/].\n\nThe First-Ever Protocol Consensus Voting Process\nThis proposal suggests modifying the PART emission rate and dividing block\nrewards between stakers and a Treasury Fund. And because the scope of the\nchanges proposed here are quite significant and affect the protocol directly, a\n“protocol consensus changing vote\" is thus required.\n\nA protocol consensus changing vote is not much different than any other type of\non-chain voting on Particl. The differences are with the required approval rate,\nwhich is 75% instead of 60%, and the duration of the voting process, which is\n10,080 blocks (~2 weeks) instead of 5,040 (~1 week).\n\nAside from these two differences, the process of voting on a protocol consensus\nchanging proposal is exactly the same as voting on a non-protocol consensus\nproposal.\n\nThe Timeline\nTo give enough time for stakeholders to prepare their nodes for the vote, we\nwant to reveal today the timeline that will lead us to begin this voting\nprocess. That’ll allow everyone to prepare accordingly and ensure no block is\nwasted (i.e., a block that registers no vote).\n\nThis Tuesday\nThis Tuesday (tomorrow), we will close the proposal’s discussion phase and merge\nit to get it ready for its voting phase. If you still have questions, comments,\nor general feedback about this proposal, please leave a comment on its Github\npage [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] before it gets merged.\n\nOn the same day, we will communicate the block numbers for when the vote will\nstart and end. Expect a pre-notice of roughly 72 hours (approximation based on\naverage block time) before the vote starts.\n\nParticl’s staking application, Partyman, will also be updated and allow\nstakeholders to set up their voting preferences in advance so that their node(s)\nstart casting votes as soon as they can.\n\nThis Friday\nIt is estimated that, on this week’s Friday, the voting period will begin. This\nis only an estimate as the actual time the voting will start is based on a block\nnumber, not a specific date or time. As block times can vary (they are on\naverage 2 minutes apart), we can only offer an estimate.\n\n10,080 Blocks Later\n10,080 blocks after the voting period begins, or approximately two weeks, the\nvoting period will end and we’ll be able to communicate the official results\n(they are publicly available on the blockchain).\n\nTo ensure the team acts as fast as possible on the outcome of the vote, we will\nprepare, in advance, builds containing the required modifications for the\ndecentralized treasury model to be implemented.\n\nIf the proposal is approved by stakeholders, we will send these builds to\nexchanges and request their collaboration to roll out the hardfork (exchanges\nrequire a pre-notice of several days or weeks). If, at some point, there is a\nmathematical certainty that the proposal is approved, the team will submit in\nadvance its request to hardfork to exchanges, even if the voting process is not\nentirely done. That should save the project a few days and allow us to move\nfaster.\n\nIf the proposal is rejected, the team will not use the builds it developed in\nadvance and keep, unchanged, the blockchain parameters as they are currently. In\nthat situation, the Particl blockchain will still hardfork, but that’ll only\ncontain changes related to the re-activation of temporarily disabled anon and\nblind outputs.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, this is a critical proposal for the future of the project and the\necosystem. It has vast implications and may lead to vital changes to the\nunderlying protocol of the blockchain. Regardless of if you want to approve or\nreject this proposal, it is highly recommended that you cast your vote and let\nyour voice be heard. There has never been a more important time to do so.\n\nAs always, we want to thank you for your immense support and hope that you all\nvote in great numbers on this future-shaping proposal.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

If approved, this would lead to creating a Treasury Fund that would collect, at every staked block, a number of PART coins that can then be used by either the Particl team or the community to fund initiatives and projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem.</p><p>To learn more about this proposal, you can refer directly to the proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8\"><strong>here</strong></a> or read the related Particl News blog post <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h1 id=\"the-first-ever-protocol-consensus-voting-process\">The First-Ever Protocol Consensus Voting Process</h1><p>This proposal suggests modifying the PART emission rate and dividing block rewards between stakers and a Treasury Fund. And because the scope of the changes proposed here are quite significant and affect the protocol directly, a “protocol consensus changing vote\" is thus required.</p><p>A protocol consensus changing vote is not much different than any other type of on-chain voting on Particl. <strong>The differences are with the required approval rate, which is 75% instead of 60%, and the duration of the voting process, which is 10,080 blocks (~2 weeks) instead of 5,040 (~1 week).</strong></p><p>Aside from these two differences, the process of voting on a protocol consensus changing proposal is exactly the same as voting on a non-protocol consensus proposal.</p><h1 id=\"the-timeline\">The Timeline</h1><p>To give enough time for stakeholders to prepare their nodes for the vote, we want to reveal today the timeline that will lead us to begin this voting process.

This marks a significant milestone\nfor the Particl ecosystem as it moves towards a more community-powered form of\ngovernance.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go over this proposal’s\nimplications.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nVoting for the Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] was a\nsignificant event for the Particl project. It was the first time a CCS proposal\nrequired to be approved through a vote and, for this reason, served as a great\nshowcase and test of Particl’s on-chain voting technology.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mindblowing 99.97% approval rate (minimum required is 60%) and a \n63.17% participation rate (minimum required is 20%). Indeed, the vote lasted for\n5,040 blocks, with 3,184 of them voting in favor of the proposal and just one\nblock voting against it.\n\nWhat About the Claim Process Now?\nWith the proposal officially approved by Particl stakeholders, now’s the time to\nget moving! As such, we can now announce that the claim period will begin\ntomorrow. To help you understand the output claim process and its timeline, we\nwill publish, tomorrow, a blog post on Particl News containing all the necessary\ninformation to submit your outputs and get them validated so that they can be\nre-enabled after the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIt’s important to be aware that the output claim process will be separated into\ntwo phases; the pre-fork and post-fork phases. \n\nIf you submit your outputs for validation before the upcoming hardfork and the\ncutoff date, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use\nyour currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course,\nimplies that your claim gets approved.\n\nKeep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance\nbefore the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the\nactual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase\nis actually going to be several days or weeks before the hardfork. We will\nclearly communicate this deadline before its time.\n\nIf you submit your outputs after the upcoming hardfork, then you’ll be part of\nthe post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but\nyou’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current\ntime, not scheduled.\n\nFor this reason, we strongly recommend submitting your outputs as fast as you\ncan.\n\nHeaded Towards Community Governance\nIt is safe to say that this on-chain voting exercise, the first of its kind on\nthe Particl network, was a resounding success. It highlights just how active\nParticl stakeholders are and how willing they are to actively participate in the\ngovernance of the project.\n\nWith this highly encouraging participation rate in mind, you can expect more\nproposals requiring a vote to be published on the CCS in the weeks, months, and\nyears to come. Some of them may come from the Particl team itself, but anyone\ncan submit a proposal of their own and request a vote for it.\n\nOn that end, the Particl team would like to reiterate its position that it fully\nsupports and encourages quality community initiatives. It is by having a good\nmix of team and community proposals, as well as a significant diversity in the\nideas proposed on the CCS, that Particl will achieve optimal levels of\ndecentralization!\n\nSecond Proposal Voting to Begin This Week\nThe Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] is\nonly the first proposal to require on-chain voting of many to come. As such, a\nsecond proposal, the Decentralized Treasury Model proposal\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8], will begin its voting phase\nat the end of this week.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News as we will publish, later today, a blog post\nexplaining in detail the timeline for this proposal and its voting phase. If you\nstill have questions, comments, or general feedback about it, please leave a\ncomment on its Github page [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] \nbefore it gets merged into the voting phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your overwhelming support and participating in such\nnumbers in this critical first on-chain voting process for Particl. We are as\nconfident as ever moving forward with a more community-powered form of\ngovernance and are pretty excited to see all the great things we will achieve\ntogether!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These new builds fix the vast\nmajority of previously identified bugs and issues.

That's where you come in!\n\nIf you encounter any problem while testing this new version of Particl V3 or\nhave feedback to give, please add a \"new issue\" on Github (click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new/choose]). Make sure to\nexplain in detail the problem you’ve encountered, how to reproduce it, and the\nOS you’re using. The Particl developers will then pick it up and work on it.\n\n> Note 1: The “Windows bug” preventing Particl V3 from launching properly for some\nWindows user is still present with this release. The cause has been identified\nand is currently being resolved. It is a slightly more complicated issue to fix\nand, for this reason, will be fixed in the next Particl V3 testnet build.\n> Note 2: Please follow carefully the installation instructions located in the\nsection below, especially if you’ve previously installed and run a Particl V3\ntestnet build.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.0.0-RC-test003: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.0.0-RC-test003\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.0.0 Public Testnet (release 3) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopSecond public testnet release build for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop v3.0.0NB!!

Using the last testnet client you've used before this new release, move all\n    testnet coins from any Market wallets to a different wallet (i.e., the\n    default wallet). Close Particl Desktop entirely so that it is no longer\n    running.\n 2. While Particl Desktop is NOT running, delete the testnet wallet folder \n    profiles (located in particl/testnet).\n 3. Then, delete the folder containing the MP database (located in \n    particl-market/testnet/03).\n\nLocation of Folders on Windows\n * Profiles Folder \n\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Particl\\testnet or \n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Particl\\testnet\\wallets\n\n * MP Database\n\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\\testnet\\03\"\n\nLocation of Folders on MacOS\n * Profiles Folder\n\n~/Library/Application Support/Particl/testnet\n\n * MP Database\n\n~/Library/Application Support/particl-market/testnet/03\n\nLocation of Folders on Linux\n * Profiles Folder\n\n~/.particl/testnet\n\n * MP Database\n\n~/.particl-market/testnet/03\n\nDiscussions and Feedback\nYour insights are infinitely valuable for us to enhance and improve Particl\nDesktop and Particl Marketplace. To that end, the Particl community forum\n[https://particl.community/] is the perfect place for focused discussions and to\nget to know what others have observed.\n\nTo help to streamline community testing for Particl V3-testnet, the community\nhas prepared a Marketplace Testing category to the forum where you can report\nissues to other community members and see what others are coming up with. Simply\nfollow this link [https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing] to\nland in the right place.\n\nStill, if you find any observation that has found a certain degree of consensus,\nyou are kindly asked to formally publish it on the Github Issues\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] page. This way, it is\nguaranteed that the developers won’t miss it.\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node:\n   addnode \"212.47.250.16:51938\" \"add\"\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * NB!! The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source\n   code. Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\n   source code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval\n   of time has passed.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground.\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog\nWhat follows is a list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements made to Particl\nV3 since its first testnet release. This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nParticl Market\n- Update how categories are retrieved for various markets\n\n- Blacklisting of markets (when flagging/voting to remove markets) should not\nhappen when voting but when calculating the vote result\n\n- Prevent automatic deletion of any old/expired listings that are still included\nin a cart\n\n- Fixed removal of a joined market failing if the market has been flagged by the\ncurrent user\n\n- Updated the default categories for Open Market type of markets.\n\nParticl Desktop (Market Module)\n- Updated the identity drop-down toggle as it appears to do nothing if identity\ncreation/addition is disabled and there are no additional identities available\n(which is the default state)\n\n- Present a previously missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when attempting to create\na new market with an encrypted (locked) wallet\n\n- Display a more applicable error message when accepting a bid fails due to\ninsufficient funds\n\n- Swapped the positions of the public and anon balance amounts in the Overview\ncomponent (to make more sense, and was requested quite a bit by the community)\n\n- Display when a promoted market expires in the Market Browser tab.\n\n- Set the 'Completed and Archived' checkbox in both the Buy > Orders page and\nthe Sell > Orders page, to be checked by default. This addresses a concern that\ncompleted or cancelled orders seemed to disappear\n\n- Changed the country selection filters in the Browse [Listings] page to render\nwith check boxes next to the country name. Clearing a country filter by\nre-selecting it was not very clear before, and this attempts to guide the user\nby indicating that that a selected country can be re-selected to clear it\n\n- After successfully creating a storefront market, the category editor opens to\ndirect the storefront admin to add categories\n\n- Fixed input validation criteria on the Create Market page: max character\nlengths were not validating correctly.\n\n- Display the market ID key on each promoted market, so as to provide a unique\nidentifier for a promoted market.\n\n- Updated the code for retrieving the correct market category list when\npublishing products (necessary due to changes in the Market system's handling of\nlisting categories)\n\n- Fixed an intermittent issue when editing a previously created product in which\na market and category were selected and saved: the category may not have always\nbeen shown to be selected correctly, and the category list may have shown the\nincorrect category list.\n\n- Added an option to navigate back to 'Products and Listings' from the 'Product\nImport' section (previously the only option was to use the main menu to navigate\nback to the 'Sell' page, and subsequently to the 'Products and Listings' tab).\n\n- Fixed the linked URL for Transaction ID's displayed for an order in both the\nBuy > Orders page and the Sell > Orders page, that would always point to the\nmainnet block explorer rather than the testnet block explorer when running on\nthe testnet chain.\n\n-Fixed order notification counters not working as intended, particularly around\ncancelled/rejected/completed orders\n\nParticl Desktop (Wallet Module)\n- Allow for the transaction ID to be copied in both the Overview page as well as\nthe Transaction History page\n\n- Added a warning during address label editing that indicates that the label is\nnot saved until the save button is clicked\n\n- Zapping of cold staking funds is now disabled when the wallet balance is 0\n\n- Fixed an issue preventing someone from disabling cold staking when their\nwallet balance funds is 0.\n\nParticl Desktop (Layout and Styling)\n- Simplified the display of the wallet module's transaction table entries (also\nas viewed on the wallet module's Overview page)\n\n- Tweaked the background blur for modals (looks nicer now)\n\n- Aligned visual changes made in other tweaks with the overall application theme\n(i.e., updated the market visualization in the market browser for the displaying\nof the unique market ID as well as the displaying of the market promotion\nexpiration time)\n\n- Added an explicit section in the market creation page detailing how a created\nmarket is private by default unless the keys are shared or the market is\npromoted\n\n- Minor styling tweaks and cleanup of unused styles\n\nGeneral\n- Enabled the generation of Windows 32-bit builds again\n\n- Fixed an error message being displayed that crashes the application when the\nuser closes the application while the market module is starting up.\n\n- Testing, updates and fixes related to updating Particl Core versions 0.19.2.5 \nto 0.19.2.8\n\n- Allow for specific URLs to be opened in the user's current browser instead of\nin a webview container within the application\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to fix parsing of startup params/flags that\ncontain dashes\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to allow for the core console modal to\nprocess command string escapings as per Particl Core\n\n- Fixed various spelling mistakes in the text\n\n- Added the ability to display a randomized \"Message of the Day\" on the\nloading/welcome page. These are not currently displayed as the messages are not\nyet available, but the functionality is now available\n\n- Updated text strings where applicable\n\n- Fixed CircleCI test runner to execute again (note: just gets CircleCI running\nagain - testing still fails due to problematic test cases which still need to be\nfixed and/or written)\n\n- Enabled codespell checks during test execution\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second round of community testing has started, now let's get cracking! Don't\nforget to also spread the word around about the upcoming Particl V3 mainnet\nrelease. Every bit helps, whether that is testing, promoting, or even just\nsharing screenshots and GIFs of Particl V3! \n\nWe are blessed to have such a dedicated and passionate community, and for this\nreason, we'd like to thank you for your continued support and patience as we get\nthis baby ready for mainnet!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It breaks down the proposed solutions to re-enable temporarily\ndisabled anon and blind outputs and the strategy used to re-establish the\nblockchain’s integrity with the correct supply moving forward.\n\nTo get up to speed with that information, simply follow the Particl News link\nlocated at the top of this section.\n\n> Note: An update has been added to the above blog post to indicate how to collect\nand submit outputs using the new Particl Desktop 2.3.6 release.\nIncreased Focus on Community Governance\nOn-Chain Voting and CCS ProposalsLearn everything about Particl’s on-chain\nvoting system and how it ties into community CCS proposals!Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/]Over the past weeks and\nmonths, the Particl project has initiated a significant shift towards a more\ndecentralized method of governance. This shift aims at putting you, every\ncommunity member, into a more important position of power over what happens with\nthe project.\n\nAs such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing\nhow the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain\nvoting tool and the CCS proposal system.\n\nThe on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the\nblockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on\nthe CCS.\n\nIf you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the\nParticl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on\nby the community.\n\nFor all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in\nwith the CCS system, check out this blog post available on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/].\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]To\nempower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance\nmodel, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model\nthat could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.\n\nThis decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in\nthe coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to\n8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other\n50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.\n\nThe Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft\nproposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit\nthe Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the\ntreasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the\non-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.\n\nIn May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post\nexplaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds\nfrom the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose,\nand so on. Keep your eyes peeled on Particl News for when that blog post lands.\n\nFirst Proposal to Require a Vote Now Live on the CCS\nDelegated Output Claim Management by cryptoguard · Pull Request #7 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal is to implement a streamlined and\nmore\nefficient way to process manual output claims and reactivate temporarily\ndisabled anon and blind balances.RationaleOn the 25th of Febr...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7]April also saw the first CCS\nproposal ever to require an on-chain community vote to be activated. Indeed,\ncreated out of firm community feedback, the Delegated Output Claim Management\nProposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7] suggests nominating a\ngroup composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate\nindividual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. \n\nOnce validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one\ncomposed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This\nsecond group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no\nclaim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.\n\nIt seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire\nmethod to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon\nthe assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.\n\nThis proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for\nvoting in the next few days. If you have any questions or comments, you can\nvisit the AMA/FAQ thread dedicated to this proposal on Reddit by following this\nlink\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/n0ld5d/amafaq_delegated_output_claim_management_proposal/]\n.\n\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nNew Particl Releases and V3 Progress ReportDownload and install the new Particl\nDesktop and Core releases and get up to speed with the latest Particl V3\nprogress report.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-releases-and-v3-progress-report/]As Particl V3\nnears completion for its mainnet release, a development progress report has been\npublished during April. It explains, in detail, what’s been completed since the\nlast report, what’s being worked on, and also what’s left to complete for the\nnext testnet round to go live.\n\nInterestingly, the report also mentions that all slowdowns and issues mentioned\nin the March 2021 Project Update have been resolved and that Particl V3\ndevelopment is back at its usual, full pace. You can now expect more frequent\ndevelopment updates regarding Particl Desktop (Particl V3) and other components\nof the Particl ecosystem.\n\nNew Particl Desktop and Core releases\nNew Particl Releases and V3 Progress ReportDownload and install the new Particl\nDesktop and Core releases and get up to speed with the latest Particl V3\nprogress report.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-releases-and-v3-progress-report/]To help users\nsubmit their outputs to the team, new Particl Core (0.19.2.6) and Particl\nDesktop (2.3.6) releases have been pushed to Github. These releases will also\nease and simplify the process for users to submit individual claims to re-enable\ntemporarily disabled anon and blind outputs when the time comes for it.\n\nAs always, it’s highly recommended to update your Particl client to the latest\nversion.\n\nWork on BasicSwap Resumes\nNow that the code for the second hardfork and the tracer script is complete,\nParticl Lead Core Developer Tecnovert has resumed working on BasicSwap,\nParticl’s upcoming atomic swap based DEX.\n\nBasicSwap, which enables trustless and private swaps between different\ncryptocurrencies (not just in and out of PART), is poised to play a vital role\nwithin the Particl ecosystem moving forward. Not only will it provide more\nresilience against the power exchanges hold over Particl, but it’ll also make\nacquiring PART easier, more accessible, and entirely anonymous. An integration\nof BasicSwap into Particl Desktop is planned and is currently in progress (more\ndetails on that in a later Particl News blog post).\n\nAs development continues, BasicSwap will soon be opened for testing as a public\nbeta. Stay vigilant as it will be announced on Particl News when ready.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet prepared for May as things are about to lift for Particl. You can expect the\nvoting periods for two major proposals to go live, which will mark a new phase\nfor the Particl project, one more focused on community governance and\ndecentralization.\n\nThings are about to get exciting and move forward at a much faster pace than the\npast few months.

This shift aims at putting you, every community member, into a more important position of power over what happens with the project.</p><p>As such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing how the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain voting tool and the CCS proposal system.</p><p>The on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the blockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on the CCS.</p><p>If you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the Particl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on by the community.</p><p>For all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in with the CCS system, check out <a href=\"https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/\"><strong>this blog post available on Particl News</strong></a>.</p><h1 id=\"decentralized-treasury-model\">Decentralized Treasury Model</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about the new CCS proposal to form a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Blog</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/d61e2b944bf46e43f071527ffeff4776/medium-particl-treasury.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>To empower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance model, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model that could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.</p><p>This decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in the coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to 8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other 50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.</p><p>The Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft proposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the treasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the on-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.</p><p>In May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post explaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds from the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose, and so on.
