I’ve had the\nchance to have several back and forths with him, and have asked him a few\nquestions to let you all know a bit more about our new fellow Particl family\nmember! You can follow him on the following platforms:\n\nGithub: https://github.com/spazzymoto\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-edwards-82464992/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCould you give a small resume of your professional journey?\n> After school, I’ve started working for a company that does process\ninstrumentation. I was mainly coding front ends that interfaced with the\ndevices. I worked there for around 2 years and then took my “gap year” where I\nwent sailing in the med and the carribean for about 2 years.When I got back to\nSouth Africa, I was chatting to Ryno who told me to come for an interview at the\ncompany he was currently working at, which did financial based software. I got\nthe job there and that is where I spent my last 9 years.\n\nSo where did you meet Ryno initially?\n> I met Ryno years ago, I went to a house party with some friends when we were\nstill in school. Turns out it was at Ryno’s house. We’ve been friends since\nthen.\nWhere does the Spazzymoto username come from?\n> Growing up, I did a lot of sailing with my dad and I think he came up with\nSpazzymoto as the name for one of our boats. I latched on to it as it’s a\nusername no one else uses that I’ve seen, so it makes registering at new\nwebsites really easy.\nHas Particl been your introduction to blockchain development?\n> It has been. I did a course or two at my old company to see how we could\npotentially use blockchain, but these were very high-level overviews.\nWere you personally involved/interested in some way in cryptocurrencies before\nParticl then?\n> Besides owning some cryptocurrencies and following a few, mainly Particl & Nano,\nI wasn’t really involved although it is an area that has always interested me. I\nthink it has massive potential and I can’t wait to see what’s to come.\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenge for cryptocurrencies’ mainstream (or\nwider) adoption?\n> I think the biggest problems I see, in my opinion, are:1) I could explain to my\nparents how to buy Particl, for example. I think massive improvements have been\nmade to make this process easier, but I think we as a community can do better!\n2) I think another issue is convincing people to actually use their crypto on\nthe marketplace instead of just “hodling”. I guess no one wants to spend today\nwhat could be worth a lot more in the future. I think this will get better as\nthe crypto prices stabilize though.\n\nHow did you get to join Particl?\n> After 9 years at my previous company, I felt like Iwas in a bit of a rut/comfort\nzone, that I wasn’t really challenging myself anymore. I therefore took the\nplunge and registered on a South African tech job site to see what was out there\nand if there were any jobs were I felt that I could challenge myself. Low and\nbehold, Ryno found me there and the rest is history as they say.\nWhat makes you the most excited about Particl?\n> I think Particl’s vision, it has a great team of people guiding and working on\nit. I think the marketplace is a great example of the dedication of this team to\ndrive innovation in the crypto space.\nWhat is your fresh/outside perspective on Particl?\n> The thing I love most about Particl compared to, say Bitcoin, is that I see it\nas a green cryptocurrency. The amount of energy being consumed to mine bitcoin\nis outrageous. That, and I feel like Particl consistently pushes the boundaries,\nI can’t wait for the marketplace to hit mainnet.\nDo you plan on personally use it? What would you like to sell or buy the most?\n> I am definitely going to use it, I will have to go see what I can sell, although\nI’m not really sure I’d have anything to sell at this point, but you never know!\nAs for buying, anything that means one less trip to a shopping center! I hate\nshopping centers.\nWhat is your specific role in Particl Desktop? In other words, what is a typical\nday for you working for Particl.\n> My role is to turn coffee into code! I think compared to my previous job, I get\nto actually code a lot more as opposed to all the design & estimation meetings\nthat I was used to. I am new to the project, but I’m hoping I can dig in and\nhelp share the load with the rest of the guys.\nWhat item or part of Particl will you be working on? I’ve heard you were going\nto start on Copay. What updates are you making to it?\n> My first task has been to update the Particl Copay app to the latest version\nfrom Bitpay. This was quite a few commits behind and required some updates to\nthe supporting bitcore wallet service and supporting libraries.Following updates\nwill be: An iOS version, notifications, support for Particl, but also Bitcoin &\nBitcoin Cash wallets, and cold staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDue to the team’s almost exclusive focus on marketplace development as of late,\nthe Particl Copay mobile app had been put on the backburner for some time. It’s\ndefinitely going to be refreshing to see all these updates take place for\nParticl’s mobile app, especially the long-awaited iOS version and cold staking\nfeatures.

All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins\nand still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but\nsmaller, staking rewards. To know all the benefits cold staking pools can bring\nyou as well as the network, please read our blog post linked just below this\nparagraph.\n\nCold Staking Pools — What You Need to Know\n[https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3]\nCold staking pools have been an item the community has been requesting for\nquite\nsome time, and they are now available…\n[https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3]\n\nVery shortly after the release of the cold staking pool protocol, we were\ndelighted to see three independently ran pools see the day.\n\n * Tecnovert’s Pool http://66.172.10.231:903/\n * Tecnovert’s Pool (Testnet) http://66.172.10.231:902/\n * CryptoAcademie’s Pool http://167.179.93.172/\n * Particl.Page’s Pool https://pool.particl.page/\n\nTo get more technical information about cold staking pools as well as tutorials\non how to connect to an existing pool or create one of your own, please read our\ndedicated Wiki pages linked below:\n\n * Technical information: https://particl.wiki/pools\n * Join an existing pool: https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_connect\n * Create your own pool: https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_create\n\nInterview With Robert Edwards\nInterview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nOn the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert\nEdwards.

The Particl Copay upgrades currently\nbeing worked on include multi-currency support (i.e. hold Bitcoin directly on\nParticl Copay), cold staking capabilities, iOS compatibility, and more.\n\nTo get to know Rob a bit better, don’t forget to read his interview published\non\nour blog\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nby following the link just above this section of the Community Update!\n\nParticl Core 0.17.1.0 Moves to Pre-Release Stage\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n\nTo get a strong start of the year, Tecnovert moved Particl Core 0.17.1.0 to its\npre-release stage, on mainnet. This means anyone can now download and install\nthis new Core update.\n\nIt’s important to note that, even though a lot of progress has been made on\n0.17.1.0 as it relates to the Trezor hardware wallet integration\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed], this\nupdate does not bring any new immediate feature or fix to Particl, and is being\npushed in the spirit of keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s at all\ntime.\n\nParticl’s Github Page Reaches 20,000 Commits\nOn December 12, Particl Core’s Github repository reached an interesting\nmilestone by registering it’s 20,000th commit (now standing at 20,185\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core])! This is both a testament to the\nteam’s relentless efforts at building the Particl platform and the benefits of\nkeeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s.\n\nParticl Ranks as the 11th Best Crypto Github Account of 2018\nAnother clear demonstration of what we mean when we say we’re out here to code\nand develop, not just hype and waste time, is the fact that Particl was ranked\nby CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] as the 11th best crypto Github project\nin 2018. CoinCodeCap is similar in nature to Darpal Rating\n[https://medium.com/dprating] (which unfortunately hasn’t put out any new Github\nranking for months) and ranks projects not based on price or marketcap, but by\nthe actual development being made to it.\n\nHere is how Particl ranked throughout the year in code rankings:\n\n * CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] (last 12 months) -> 21st\n * CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] (last 12 months) -> 11th\n * Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/dprating] (monthly) -> Constantly between\n   3rd and 7th, except for their last report where they oddly started taking\n   marketcap into consideration\n * Chinese KOL [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/962457662423273472] \n   (February 2018) -> 4th\n\nParticl’s Development Year in Review\nWe’ve just published an animation of all the work that’s been done over the year\non Github. Using the same open-source software we used for our Development\nTimeline blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513], we’ve\nfocused on the work done by the Particl team on all active Particl Github\nrepositories [http://github.com].\n\nIn the above video available on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg], developers with\ntheir names in green represent Particl team members while developers with their\nnames in white/grey are Bitcoin folks. Not only does this video proves that the\nParticl development team is relentless and very active, but also shows just how\nbeneficial keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin is.\n\nYes, it does look like Bitcoin developers are making commits to Particl Core,\nbut they’re really making commits to Bitcoin Core. The reason why they’re\nshowing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code\nis reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security,\nstability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly\nreflected on Particl Core. It’s like two teams working hand in hand!\n\nMubiz About to Release its New User Interface\n> \nFor those not aware of Mubiz, they are community members building a web\ninterface that will allow you to access Particl’s Open Marketplace directly from\nthe web as well as pay with more traditional means of payments than\ncryptocurrencies. Mubiz will also offer a wide array of services targeted to\nbuyers such as customer support, returns of products, reputation, shipping\nmanagement, escrow management (buyers won’t need to lock up extra funds), and\nmore. In other words, Mubiz seeks to make Particl’s Open Marketplace as easy to\nuse as any other traditional marketplace by building a service on top of the\nParticl protocol.\n\nMubiz announced this week that they will be releasing their new and improved\nuser interface tomorrow (Saturday the 5th of January 2019), and we are very\nexcited to see how it will look like!\n\nInfographics\nWe released two Open Marketplace infographics in December, if you missed those,\nhere they are! Share them far and wide!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the development update part of this Community Update.

The reason why they’re showing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code is reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security, stability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly reflected on Particl Core. It’s like two teams working hand in hand!</p><h3 id=\"mubiz-about-to-release-its-new-user-interface\">Mubiz About to Release its New User Interface</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>For those not aware of Mubiz, they are community members building a web interface that will allow you to access Particl’s Open Marketplace directly from the web as well as pay with more traditional means of payments than cryptocurrencies.

CoinCodeCap is similar in nature to <a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating\"><strong>Darpal Rating</strong></a> (which unfortunately hasn’t put out any new Github ranking for months) and ranks projects not based on price or marketcap, but by the actual development being made to it.</p><p>Here is how Particl ranked throughout the year in code rankings:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\"><strong>CryptoMiso</strong></a><strong> (last 12 months) -></strong> 21st</li><li><a href=\"https://coincodecap.com/\"><strong>CoinCodeCap</strong></a><strong> (last 12 months) -></strong> 11th</li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating\"><strong>Darpal Rating</strong></a> <strong>(monthly) -></strong> Constantly between 3rd and 7th, except for their last report where they oddly started taking marketcap into consideration</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/962457662423273472\"><strong>Chinese KOL</strong></a> <strong>(February 2018) -></strong> 4th</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-s-development-year-in-review\">Particl’s Development Year in Review</h3><p>We’ve just published an animation of all the work that’s been done over the year on Github.

Not only does this video proves that the Particl development team is relentless and very active, but also shows just how beneficial keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin is.</p><p>Yes, it does look like Bitcoin developers are making commits to Particl Core, but they’re really making commits to Bitcoin Core. The reason why they’re showing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code is reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security, stability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly reflected on Particl Core. It’s like two teams working hand in hand!</p><h3 id=\"mubiz-about-to-release-its-new-user-interface\">Mubiz About to Release its New User Interface</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>For those not aware of Mubiz, they are community members building a web interface that will allow you to access Particl’s Open Marketplace directly from the web as well as pay with more traditional means of payments than cryptocurrencies. Mubiz will also offer a wide array of services targeted to buyers such as <strong>customer support</strong>, <strong>returns of products</strong>, <strong>reputation</strong>, <strong>shipping management</strong>, <strong>escrow management</strong> (buyers won’t need to lock up extra funds), and more. In other words, <strong>Mubiz seeks to make Particl’s Open Marketplace as easy to use as any other traditional marketplace</strong> by building a service on top of the Particl protocol.</p><p>Mubiz announced this week that they will be releasing their new and improved user interface tomorrow (Saturday the 5th of January 2019), and we are very excited to see how it will look like!</p><h3 id=\"infographics\">Infographics</h3><p>We released two Open Marketplace infographics in December, if you missed those, here they are!

There is a very simple reason behind it: it’s one of the first\ntime people can actually gain full control over their own money and transact\nwith anyone in the world without requiring the assistance or oversight of any\nthird-party or authority figure. In other words, Bitcoin gives us, the people,\nfinancial and economic freedom like never before.\n\nAs great as it sounds, Bitcoin is still unfortunately pretty dependent on\ncentralized infrastructure, and thus, is having a hard time realizing its\nvision. When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what\ndo you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat\ncurrencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an\neCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service\ncompany that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf.\nThat is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating\nthrough all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized.\nNot only does this practice goes against everything Bitcoin was created for,\nnamely the vision of a new economy, one that is independent of centralized\nauthorities and third-parties, but it also makes Bitcoin’s adoption as a\ncurrency a dud.\n\nSo how do we fix that problem? How can we fill the gap to adoption and place the\nfinal piece of the puzzle, so to speak? How can we get to the point where we\nwon’t have to exit crypto anymore because spending Bitcoin and other coins will\nbe easier than switching back to the old global fiat economy?\n\nBitcoin’s Missing Piece to its Grand Puzzle\nBitcoin is almost everything a currency should be, but there appears to be\nsomething missing for a true crypto-based economy to flourish and thrive. Of\ncourse, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and\nwithout intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult\nto find within all the noise. Because most people value convenience so much,\nthey would rather spend more money and “exit” the crypto ecosystem rather than\ngoing through the hassle of finding these vendors.\n\nThe end result is that, as it stands today, Bitcoin is used for mostly three\nthings: trading/speculation, remittance payments, and store of value. It is\ncertainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is\ncertain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services\nis, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat\ncurrencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people\noutside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main\nreasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.\n\nWhen we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to\nfirst recognize the challenges we still face to this day. Without Bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies being at least as easily, affordably, and conveniently\nspendable as traditional currencies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is likely to\nremain stuck within its own bubble. The path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\n> The path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the\nindependent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized\ninfrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\nWith the Bitcoin cryptocurrency ecosystem and community quickly growing within\nthe last few years, it seems the final roadblock in the path to mainstream\nadoption and the realization of crypto as a truly independent economy is the\nability to be able to easily spend coins without third-party and have it be as\nconvenient and affordable as it would be when spending traditional currencies\nwithin the global fiat economy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Day Has Come for Crypto to Claim its Independence\nUp until now, and even after all these years, there hasn’t been any clear\nsolution to the issue of not being able to spend Bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies with the same freedom and convenience you can transact them.\nMany companies and websites have tried to claim they were allowing people to\neasily spend their coins, but in the end, it always required you to trust that\nentity and pay fees on top of it. Far from ideal!\n\nThere is, however, a project presenting itself as a solid and completely\ntrustless solution to the now decade-old coin spending problem, and could very\nwell help Bitcoin’s adoption as an actual currency. Let’s dive right into what\nmakes this project such a good candidate to be that missing piece of the\nBitcoin’s puzzle.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace\nBuilt on the most recent Bitcoin codebase, Particl’s Open Marketplace is a\ndecentralized, fully trustless marketplace specifically designed to work with\nyour favorite cryptocurrency. Imagine a platform similar to eBay, but with no\nintermediary whatsoever, the possibility to use your favorite coin (including\nBitcoin), built with privacy at its core, and with barely any fee. All the good\nstuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!\n\nThe absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace\nto run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The\nbuilt-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin\ncodebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that no party,\nsuch as a platform operator or payment processor, can access your personal\ninformation. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping\naddress to the vendors you’re buying products from.\n\nBuilt on the Bitcoin Codebase\nParticl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has\nall the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin,\nincluding a default integration of Segwit, Lightning Network\n[http://lightning.network]-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of\nthe Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is\nnamed Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that Particl is not an ICO, not an\nEthereum-token, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control\nover its ecosystem. The blockchain was launched in a very fair way years ago and\nis developed by a team of mostly Bitcoin fanatics [http://particl.io/about-us] \nthat have been working in crypto for quite some time and have made names for\nthemselves. Particl’s Github page [http://github.com/particl] is one of the most\nactive one in the entire blockchain industry, and the amount of work being done\non it is tremendous, especially in comparison to other cryptocurrency projects,\nalways ranking in among the top coins in Darpal’s Github Audit Reports\n[https://medium.com/@DPRating].\n\nUse Your Favorite Coin\nStraying away from the counter-productive “tribalism” currently plaguing the\ncrypto industry, Particl Open Marketplace’s underlying protocol is designed to\nwork with your favorite cryptocurrency. While initial versions of the\nmarketplace might only work with PART to begin with, it has been coded in such a\nway that integrating almost any coin to its platform is made trivial. Of course,\nBitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.\n\nTribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when\nfighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed\nby the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, \nParticl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate\nin favor of its native currency. Forcing users to use a native currency is a\nmistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly\nunappealing to most people. Particl’s Open Marketplace is designed to benefit\nthe entire crypto ecosystem and add utility to all coins!\n\nPrivate-by-Design\nUsing some of the latest privacy technologies in the industry, the Open\nMarketplace is private-by-design, meaning that all purchases and sales made from\nwithin its platform are private by default, regardless of the coin used to make\nthe purchase.\n\nIn fact, Particl has been the first project to integrate RingCT, the privacy\nprotocol made popular by Monero, on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase\nother than Cryptonote, for that matter). Moreover, the entire platform is built\nwith privacy at its core, meaning no data can ever leak out of the platform or\nbe recorded in a publicly auditable fashion on the blockchain, protecting its\nusers from abusive data analysis and industry copycats. Content is stripped of\nall its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is\ndesigned to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable.\nAdditionally, you can start your own private market (currently called “bubbles”)\nand make products available only to those who you send the access key to, making\nthe entire process even more private and completely away from the eyes of\ncompetitors.\n\nRidiculously Low Fees\nParticl’s Initial Fee Schedule (Will Decrease Over Time)What would be the use of\nsuch a marketplace if fees were high? The whole point of this article was to, in\npart, point out how expensive shopping with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\ncan get because you are forced to use third-parties which, among the many\ndisadvantages they cause, charge users with fees that make spending coins not a\ncost-effective activity. For the crypto economy to really become a viable\noption, fees need to be kept at a minimum, which is exactly the case on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\nWhile Particl is already very low on fees at this current moment in time, it\nwill ultimately reach its vision and be fully integrated with both scalable and\nentirely trustless solutions which will make it a near-zero fee platform.\nProtocols such as atomic swaps\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp] (already live on mainnet\nsince October 2017), Lightning Network [http://lightning.network], Segwit, and\nothers will make using Particl extremely affordable and as convenient and fast\nas traditional eCommerce platforms.\n\nGenerally speaking, charging vendors with barely any fee, especially when they\nare used to be being abused by traditional platforms, means they will be able to\neither make more profit-per-sale or lower their prices to gain an advantage over\ntheir competitors and get bigger sales volume. The end result for the customer\nis likely to be more affordable products than anywhere else on the web. Fees on\ntraditional eCommerce platforms are outrageous, the new crypto economy is a fair\none that is centered around its users, not the platform’s operator!\n\nNo Intermediary At All\nNo, you are not dreaming. All of this is indeed available without the use of any\nthird-party or central authority whatsoever. Every feature available on the Open\nMarketplace comes from 100% trustless protocols.

Looking for\nsomething? Just type what you wish to purchase in the search bar, and be exposed\nto a multitude of vendors selling what you need. Selling stuff? Just list your\nproducts on the Open Marketplace and instantly get the exposure you deserve in\nfront of the right target audience.

There is a very simple reason behind it: it’s one of the first time people can actually gain full control over their own money and transact with anyone in the world without requiring the assistance or oversight of any third-party or authority figure. In other words, Bitcoin gives us, the people, financial and economic freedom like never before.</p><p>As great as it sounds, Bitcoin is still unfortunately pretty dependent on centralized infrastructure, and thus, is having a hard time realizing its vision. When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what do you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat currencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an eCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service company that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf. That is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating through all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized. Not only does this practice goes against everything Bitcoin was created for, namely the vision of a new economy, one that is independent of centralized authorities and third-parties, but it also makes Bitcoin’s adoption as a currency a dud.</p><p>So how do we fix that problem? How can we fill the gap to adoption and place the final piece of the puzzle, so to speak?

Of course, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and without intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult to find within all the noise. Because most people value convenience so much, they would rather spend more money and “exit” the crypto ecosystem rather than going through the hassle of finding these vendors.</p><p>The end result is that, as it stands today, Bitcoin is used for mostly three things: trading/speculation, remittance payments, and store of value. It is certainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is certain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services is, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat currencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people outside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main reasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.</p><p>When we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to first recognize the challenges we still face to this day. Without Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being at least as easily, affordably, and conveniently spendable as traditional currencies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is likely to remain stuck within its own bubble. The path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.</p><blockquote>The path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.</blockquote><p>With the Bitcoin cryptocurrency ecosystem and community quickly growing within the last few years, it seems the final roadblock in the path to mainstream adoption and the realization of crypto as a truly independent economy is the ability to be able to easily spend coins without third-party and have it be as convenient and affordable as it would be when spending traditional currencies within the global fiat economy.</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-day-has-come-for-crypto-to-claim-its-independence\">The Day Has Come for Crypto to Claim its Independence</h2><p>Up until now, and even after all these years, there hasn’t been any clear solution to the issue of not being able to spend Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the same freedom and convenience you can transact them.

In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve users' financial privacy and security.</p><h1 id=\"the-need-for-privacy-in-decommerce\">The Need for Privacy in DeCommerce</h1><p>Particl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure online marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT transactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation, RingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable capabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms have even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as exemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we have previously explored in depth <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Moreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences, tracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without consent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an unsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a scenario we’ve also previously discussed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>To safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl Marketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or distribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata. All marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such as buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through end-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">a peer-to-peer data and messaging platform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes</a>.</p><p>This privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data ownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks, exploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>While various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are still needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that eliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries within the eCommerce domain.</p><p>However, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for cryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising their safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious strangers.</p><p>As we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of cryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as eCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and well-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
