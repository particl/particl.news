This week, we've made some good progress in improving both Particl\nDesktop and Particl Core, so let's look into it right away.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer has suffered a minor injury\nthat took time off of major tasks. With this context in mind, he focused on\nsmaller (but needed) and easily deliverable improvements proposed by some of our\nmarketplace sellers.\n\n 1. In the wallet transaction list, transactions that have been abandoned will\n    now be properly displayed instead of showing the current \"0/12\n    confirmations\" indicator. Users will also be able to abandon transactions\n    right from Particl Desktop.\n 2. A filter to the \"batch publish\" modal has been added. It lets sellers filter\n    the visible products by published market, enabling them to more easily\n    republish listings when they have multiple markets and many items (with\n    items specific to particular markets). In short, it provides them the option\n    to only show items belonging to a particular market, rather than searching\n    through all the items across all the markets one by one. In some cases, it\n    can save several minutes, if not hours, especially when it comes to large\n    vendors who often update their inventories and regularly add new items.\n\nLooking forward to the coming week, we'll be able to resume progress on product\ncodes and hopefully wrap it up before the end of the week. Then, we'll continue\nworking on the in-market messaging system to get it ready for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop 3.2 update.\n\nParticl Core Development Update\nThis week, we've added some improvements and bug fixes to the Particl Core 0.21\ncodebase. Notably, an issue was fixed where the wallet can freeze when unlocking\nafter receiving an anon transaction while locked.\n\nIf the user then closes the wallet (unaware that it's stuck), it leads to errors\ncreating future transactions with AddAnonInputsFailed. This issue is now fixed\nas part of Particl Core 0.21.2.7, which is available as a pre-release here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.7].

In this week's report, we're providing a bit more information about the\nupcoming BasicSwap DEX and its open beta release timeline, so if you had\ninterrogations about it, be sure not to miss this section!\n\nWithout further ado, let's jump right in. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've wrapped up the new product code functionality which gives the\nability for sellers to better categorize and update their products.\n\nIt allows for a seller to uniquely identify their items according to their own\npredefined system. Note that this has no impact on the buyer side as the product\ncodes are not publicly displayed along with a listing; they simply exist to\nprovide some assistance to sellers in terms of inventory management. It will\nalso allow us to introduce, in the future, additional features to provide more\nthorough product updates via CSV import or alternative methods using product\ncodes as unique identifiers.\n\nOther than that, we've applied a few UI improvements to Particl Desktop, both on\nthe marketplace and desktop apps, as was suggested by current vendors.\n\nGoing into next week, the in-market messaging system (buyer - seller inbox) will\nbe the sole priority and we expect to wrap it up soon, after which Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release.\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've dealt with a tricky issue regarding integrating cold\nstaking and cold staking pools into the upcoming Particl Electrum wallet. This\nissue is still being actively resolved and is the current main focus at this\ntime for Particl's core developer Tecnovert.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Progress Update\nWe've received a few questions this week regarding Particl's upcoming\ncross-chain and private DEX; BasicSwap. As mentioned previously, we are\ncurrently working on the user interface of the protocol. This is the last\nremaining item before its open beta is ready to be released, but it's a critical\none nonetheless as it will largely contribute to the first impression people\nwill have about it. That's twice as true for any user that isn't currently a\nParticl community member (and we absolutely want to welcome them as part of our\nawesome community). That's the reason why we want to spend the proper time to\nensure that the user interface is as optimal and simple to use as possible.\n\nIndeed, in the last few years, we've seen many attempts at decentralized\nexchanges. One of the most recurring reasons why some of them do not see great\nsuccess is because they are too complicated to use for the \"common user\". \n\nTurns out, simplicity is one of BasicSwap's strengths. Indeed, it doesn't\nrequire any complicated terminal operations to function (other than the initial\nsetup, which is only temporary until proper builds are released), and all\nfeatures and functions are fully accessible from a web browser (even though it's\nstill a local application). \n\nBut to reach its full potential, it needs to be properly supported by a simple\nyet powerful user interface. And because the sheer number of features and\noptions available can get confusing for the casual crypto user; we're taking\ngreat care of building an easy-to-use but also eye-candy user interface. After\nall, we do not want to limit our user base to the technically advanced and\ngeeks; we want any crypto user to be able to benefit from a private,\ndecentralized, and no BS trading exchange that's not after their money or data. \n\nIt's important, however, to keep in mind that the first version of BasicSwap\n(its open beta) is only the first step towards a more ambitious goal. Although\nwe are confident that the open beta itself, which will run on mainnet, will\ngather a good number of users on its own, the real game-changer comes once we\nsuccessfully complete a more flexible framework we're working on.\n\nIndeed, we are working, right at this moment, on a flexible framework that would\nmake it easier for anyone to leverage the BasicSwap protocol and deploy the\nsystem on other platforms (i.e., Particl Desktop, a website, cryptocurrency\nwallets, etc). Once that is complete, that's when we expect BasicSwap to really\nshine and be integrated by partners and other players within the blockchain\nindustry. That's directly in line with our inclusive and non-tribalistic\napproach; a decentralized, free (as in freedom), and private ecosystem built for\nthe benefit of all.\n\nBut as for the progress being made on the user interface of the open beta\nitself, we have been making very good progress on it specifically within the\npast two weeks. We can confirm it is the current main focus of Particl designer\nGerlof van Ek and we expect to be able to start teasing the UI soon enough.\n\nKeep an eye out for any update on Particl News as BasicSwap is the next big\nthing to attach itself to the Particl ecosystem. We are inching closer than even\nto become 100% unstoppable! \n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nHave you tuned in to the Super Dangerous Club yet? Every Thursday at roughly ~2\nPM GMT, Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe Fisher discuss\nvarious outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of our society,\npolitics, and tech. \n\nYou might hear about...\n\n? Geopolitical news and events\n? Cryptocurrency, blockchain, and AI\n? The exponential advancement of technologies\n? Current global societal challenges\n?

For\nthat reason, we're making sure that the feature will be ready for Particl\nDesktop 3.2 in order to deploy the system suggested by the proposal promptly. To\nmake that happen more quickly, we will initially release this feature on vendor\nnodes only (no GUI integration).\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nAs for Particl Core, most of the week has been spent improving Particl Electrum\nand fixing a few reported issues. We're happy to report that Particl Electrum is\nnearing its official release and will be made available from both desktop and\nmobile devices. \n\nAdditionally, core's default ring size has also been adjusted to match the\ndefault value of Particl Desktop, improving privacy by unifying the values of\ndecoys.\n\nOn the topic of privacy, we invite you to read an important blog post we've\npublished this week on Particl News.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
