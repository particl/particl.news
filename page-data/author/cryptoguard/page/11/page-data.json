Because it is, in and of itself, a rather large\ntask that touches on many different components at once, there isn't anything\nmuch different to mention compared to last week other than the fact that we are\nmaking concrete progress towards Particl Desktop 3.3. \n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis has been a productive week for BasicSwap in general. We've kept on working\non the various security tests to ensure that everything functions as it should\nand that as many edge cases as possible are covered. As always, you can follow\nthe progress by checking out the Github commits here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nWe've also been making good, steady progress on the user interface. At this\npoint, it looks likely that it will be complete by next week and that we'll be\nable to initiate one last round of testing before going public with the beta!\n\nWe've also kept busy building a proper landing page for BasicSwap. The DEX's\nwebsite is intended to communicate the value proposition of the DEX in a quick\nand user-friendly manner and will go a long way in growing the project. The\nwebsite is scheduled to release at the same time as the beta. \n\nWrapped PART Token Now Live!\nEarlier this week, the community deployed a self-drived initiative that makes\nPART available on the Binance Smart Chain as a wrapped asset. \n\nContract Address 0x332a334cb631061298c6fe0da1a1b7a337ef5c72 | BscScanThe\nContract Address 0x332a334cb631061298c6fe0da1a1b7a337ef5c72 page allows users\nto\nview the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract\naddress. Users can also interact and make transactions to the contract directly\non BscScan.Binance (BNB) Blockchain ExplorerBscScan.com\n[https://bscscan.com/address/0x332a334cb631061298c6fe0da1a1b7a337ef5c72]Indeed,\nby using wrapping.services [https://wrapping.services/get/part/], you can now\nwrap PART into a BSC token and use it within the Binance ecosystem on compatible\nsmart-contracts. This initiative expands Particl's utility and opens up more\nopportunities, notably with the addition of wPART to BSC's most popular DEX: \nPancakeSwap [https://pancakeswap.finance]. Note that, to be able to use PART on\nPancakeSwap, you need to manually input its contract address displayed just\nbelow.\n\nwPART's contract address: 0x332A334cb631061298c6Fe0da1a1B7a337eF5C72\n\n * To add liquidity on PancakeSwap, follow this link\n   [https://pancakeswap.finance/add] and select the pairing token(s) you want to\n   support (i.e., BUSD, BNB, etc).\n * To bring wPART to other chains, you can various different bridges such as \n   cbridge [https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer].\n\nNote: wPART is deployed by wrapping.services, a centralized wrapping service\nprovider. For this reason, we highly recommend to exercise caution when\nconverting PART into wPART and do your own research. Additionally, be careful of\nwhich dApps you use when interacting with other networks. Even though these\ntypes of blockchain provide a lot of utility, they also host many dApps that\nhave either been hacked, exploited, or proven as scams over time. Do not wrap\nmore than you can afford to lose!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This week has been a busy one with two Particl Desktop releases\nand the important detailed announcement of BasicSwap, Particl's upcoming\nprivate, free, and unrestricted DEX.\n\nSo let's not wait any longer and get down to the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nDesktop Client Updates ✅\nThis week, we've released two Particl Desktop updates (3.2.1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1] and 3.2.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]). Both of these\ndesktop client updates are intended to fix bugs and improve the overall user\nimprovements with a few tweaks to the desktop client and marketplace dApp. \n\nNotably, Particl Desktop 3.2.2 fixes a particular bug that caused, in some\ncircumstances, listings and orders to not show up on some user's clients due to\nthe market service not being able to receive SMSG messages from Particl Core\nwhen offline. This is now resolved.\n\nBecause both of these clients fix a lot of issues, we strongly recommend\nupdating your desktop client as soon as you can so that you can benefit from the\nmost up-to-date Particl experience.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 ?️\nAs the two previously-mentioned Particl Desktop client updates occupied most of\nthis week's time, the work related to Particl Desktop 3.3 mentioned in last\nweek's development progress report is still ongoing.\n\n> We're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts with Particl\nDesktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when the desktop\nclient is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related updates coming\nto Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nIndeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that\nmay be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be\nable to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to\nconfigure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor\nfrom the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already\nrunning core service. — Quote from last week's progress report\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-24-06-2022/]\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAs we find ourselves in the final phase of BasicSwap's closed beta, we are\npreparing the ground for the open beta release. \n\nAs such, we've published an in-depth presentation of what BasicSwap is, what\nmakes it unique, what benefits you can draw from it, and how it's going to\nfoster a more private, free, and open financial system with no central point of\nfailure. Yes, we know this is a bold claim, but we completely own it and will\nlet BasicSwap speak for itself when it goes live. Stay tuned for more BasicSwap\nupdates coming very soon to Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]Aside from\nthis announcement, we've been running various tests and minor updates to\nBasicSwap, which will keep on going up until the release point.\n\nAs for the DEX's GUI, all of the independent modules and pages are now completed\nand we're in the final process of stitching everything together. This is the\nlast remaining part before we can start the last round of internal testing, and\nwe'll then be able to release the open beta publicly.\n\nUpdate on Marketplace Listing Fees\nBack in February, we proposed a hardfork that was accepted by stakers. This\nadded Taproot functionality into the Particl blockchain, but also fixed a bug\nwith the dynamic marketplace listing fee functionality.\n\nSince then, stakers have signaled to the network that they wanted lower SMSG\nfees, effectively massively reducing marketplace listing fees. We wanted to take\nthe opportunity, this week, to update you on what the current figures are.\n\nWhen Particl hardforked in February, the SMSG fee rate was standing at 20767.\nAfter a few months of signaling, it now stands at a mind-blowing 37!\n\nFor reference, we've polled a seller with ~300 listings on the marketplace and\nthey've stated that, in the past 30 days, they've only paid ~2.77 PART in\nlisting fees for the totality of their listings, listed every day.\n\nWithout applying any conclusion to the numbers above, we felt necessary to\nupdate the community on the current figures so that it can decide whether the\nfees should keep going down, stay as is, or be raised. As a reminder, this blog\npost [https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] explains, in\ndetail, how to signal your fee preference as a staker.\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing FeesAdjust the Particl Marketplace listing fees\nusing your staking power.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/]If anything, this\nshows that the bug fix back in February was successful and that the community\ncan now effectively and promptly adapt listing fees to any situation,\npreference, or need. This is a great news for the future of the platform and the\nnetwork's commitment to decentralized governance!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

That's how it goes! This\nweek, we've been making progress on all fronts while maintaining the Particl\nDesktop 3.2.1 testnet round that's currently ongoing and working along the\nfeedback received from the community.\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump into the nitty gritty details of this week's\ndevelopment progress!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nTestnet Status ?\nShortly after the publication of last week's progress report, we released, on\ntestnet, the latest version of Particl Desktop (3.2.1). So far, we have received\nvery few reports of issues from the community. And so, the builds seem to be\nstable on the various environments that used to be problematic, which means\nwe'll be able to release it on mainnet within the next few days. Should there be\nany issue with the \n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 ?️\nAside from taking care of the current testnet round, most of the rest of the\nweek has been spent digging into the coming changes for Particl Desktop 3.3. \n\nAt this time, we're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts\nwith Particl Desktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when\nthe desktop client is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related\nupdates coming to Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nIndeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that\nmay be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be\nable to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to\nconfigure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor\nfrom the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already\nrunning core service.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

It\nchanges the code so that outputs will be marked as \"change only\" if the script\nthey're received on is derived from the internal key chain and the containing\ntransaction spends outputs from the wallet.\n\nBefore this fix, the only criteria was that the output script was from the\ninternal key chain, meaning if a transaction was sent from another wallet to an\ninternal key (path m/1/...), the receiving wallet would treat all the outputs as\n\"change\" despite not owning any of the inputs to the transaction. And because\nchange outputs are hidden in the output of some RPC functions, the transaction\nwould not show in listtransactions or listsinceblock without a debit entry. It\nwould, however, show in filtertransactions, but without output details.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've merged minor BasicSwap DEX improvements\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master] and have been working\nthrough the process of finalizing the first version of the GUI for the open beta\nphase before we run a final internal testing round.

For example, if you wish to swap XMR for a total of 0.15 BTC, but there\nisn't any order of precisely 0.15 BTC on the order book, this change allows you\nto either take a fraction of a larger order or multiple smaller orders.\n\nWhile these two major changes are nearly completed, there are a few DB-related\nchanges that still need to happen before they are fully ready, but that should\nbe completed shortly.\n\nFinally, we've been making additional back-end improvements to the BasicSwap\nprotocol and have been making steady progress to the DEX's user interface as\nwell.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

upcoming major development cycle coming after Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump into the details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nAs we near the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.1, we've been finishing up with\nthe two remaining issues and running tests to ensure their integration. So far,\nwe've picked up a small issue in relation to the Electron dependency update in\nParticl Desktop, and we'll be addressing that this weekend and going into next\nweek.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAside from the usual and steady progress made to the upcoming DEX's user\ninterface, this week we've been exploring different ways to get a Bitcoin node\nsynced up rapidly.\n\nFor reference, while BasicSwap connects directly to a Monero public node, it\nrequires a full node for both Bitcoin and Particl to function. And while syncing\nthe Particl blockchain is not so tedious, syncing the whole Bitcoin chain can\ntake quite a lot of time. \n\nAnd so, to ensure the best user experience and as few adoption obstacles as\npossible, we've started looking at different options to circumvent that process.\nAt this time, we've identified one solution that would work relatively well and\nvery significantly cut the time required to get BasicSwap ready to swap Bitcoin,\nbut we'd like to test it more before we're ready to announce it.\n\nIn other BasicSwap news, we are almost ready to push a bunch of changes to the\nDEX's protocol that will allow users to pick up multiple orders from the order\nbook or fractions of orders.

This process will not only introduce a new layer of\ndistributed services to the ecosystem and bring Particl up to par with the\nexpected level of accessibility from Web3 apps, but it will also improve said\nWeb3 in many ways by tackling some of its most urgent issues, as we've\nhighlighted in this Particl Story\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/].\n\nIn fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to\nmake the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers,\nvendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable\nwith established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work,\nand more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3\necosystem and community.\n\nWhile we are still spending time to finalize the details of this significant\nevolutionary phase, we are now almost ready to publicly reveal the big plans\nwe've got lined up for Particl going forward and we'll be announcing it very\nshortly on Particl News with a comprehensive and in-depth blog post. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable with established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work, and more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3 ecosystem and community.</p><p>While we are still spending time to finalize the details of this significant evolutionary phase, we are now almost ready to publicly reveal the big plans we've got lined up for Particl going forward and we'll be announcing it very shortly on Particl News with a comprehensive and in-depth blog post. </p><hr><p>As always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and what it's working towards achieving.

\n\nWithout losing any time, let's get down to the crux of this week's update right\naway!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nAs we've mentioned in recent past updates, we've been working on updating\nParticl Desktop's dependencies to make the client up-to-date with all the latest\nversions of the packages it uses. This would, notably, fix some launch issues\nthat have been happening with some OS environments such as Manjaro or Fedora\nLinux distributions.\n\nToday, we can report that the base changes are mostly sorted out and that there\nare 2 changes left before we can officially mark this task as completed:\n\n 1. Complete the marketplace tests (ensuring that all updated dependencies work\n    as expected);\n 2. Complete the ZMQ-related changes for electron to ensure that Particl Desktop\n    works without issues on Windows.\n\nOnce those changes are done, we'll start the process of building Particl Desktop\nacross the different platforms and then test that all the expected functionality\nworks within these environments. We expect to get started on that during the\ncourse of next week. \n\nOnce everything is tested and confirmed to be ready, we'll create test builds\nfor internal testing, and if no issues are detected, then we'll end up releasing\nthis as Particl Desktop 3.2.1.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

We've made, once again, some good progress on both the DEX's user\ninterface and the ability to pick up multiple or fraction of orders from its\norder book, although that feature is not fully ready yet.\n\nListing Seeding Proposal\nWith product codes now integrated into Particl Desktop 3.2, we can now move\nahead with the marketplace listing seeding CCS proposal\n[http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nAs a reminder, this CCS proposal, headed by Arnold Bansemer and Cryptoguard,\naims at populating the marketplace with a significant number of listings and\nautomating some of the processes involved with the publishing of listings and\nprocessing of orders.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we'll have the first iteration of this proposal ready after\nwhich point we'll iterate it over and improve as we move ahead. Because this\nproposal is being managed in a personal capacity, its development is not part of\nthe official team scope but is going to be a focus for its owners nonetheless\nfor the next few weeks.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This week, we've\ntrucked along working on the next desktop client update as well as making nice\nprogress on improving the underlying BasicSwap code along with its interface.\n\n\nLet's not wait further and check out these updates in more detail!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nEarlier today, we published an important blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/] on Particl News\nhighlighting some of the potential deliverables we've got planned for Particl\nDesktop 3.3. Included in this blog post are strong hints at what the next\nevolutionary phase of Particl — which comes right after the release of the\nupcoming desktop client update — will look like.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 — What to ExpectFind out what you can expect for the\nupcoming Particl Desktop 3.3. release.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/]We highly recommend\nyou to give this article an attentive read and stay tuned for following blog\nposts on the topic of the next evolutionary phase for Particl coming very soon\non Particl News.\n\nIn terms of development progress this week, most of the focus has once again\nbeen on updating the various Particl Desktop dependencies and ensuring their\nproper integration and compatibility with the entirety of the desktop client.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been one crowned with very positive progress on the BasicSwap side\nof things. Not only have we made significant progress to the GUI, inching us\never closer to a point of release-readiness, but we've also been making\nbreakthrough improvements to its underlying code.\n\nIn fact, in its current state, BasicSwap only allows you to take the full amount\nof a single order from the order book. However, we've been working on improving\nthat logic by allowing you to take only a fraction of a single order, or\nmultiple orders at once. This significantly improves the usability of the DEX\nand makes it much more flexible. Although this improvement is not yet completed,\nit is well underway and we'll keep you up-to-date about it.\n\nRegarding the launch, we'd like to mention that we'll soon be ready to begin a\ntesting round, with its GUI included, within the closed Beta group. This testing\nround aims to ensure the smoothest possible public release with no issue at the\nprotocol or GUI level. Of course, we'll keep you up-to-date and informed as well\nwhen that happens so that you stand at the ready for the long-anticipated\nlaunch!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This new feature lets sellers and buyers (or potential\nbuyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form. \n\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new update introduces user messaging in two different ways. On one end,\neach listing now has a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to\nthe seller. All messages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable,\nmeaning anyone can see current and past messages sent this way. This function is\nlikely to replace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get\nyour feedback and thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet\nround.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\nAt this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make\nit possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use\nParticl Marketplace.\n\nPrivate in-order conversation between a seller and a buyerWith the messaging\nsystem now ready for the marketplace, we are currently looking at a few minor\nissues raised within the last few days and, if there's any fix required, they'll\nbe included in Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nBarring any issue stemming from the current round of internal testing, we'll be\nready to release Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet within the next 24 to 72 hours.\nThen, if all goes well, we'll be able to release it, on mainnet, a few days\nafter that.\n\nAs always, we highly encourage you to come and help us test this new major\nParticl Desktop release to ensure that no edge case or environment-specific\nissue is missed by the team. Additionally, as we've mentioned just a bit above,\nwe're also curious about your feedback regarding the deprecation of the Reviews\nfunctionality in favor of public chatrooms within listing pages.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nNew Particl Core Version ✅\nRelease Particl Core 0.21.2.9 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129Hashes56c899c09cb11948c9b81e92ff2599fbcf8cd18b10fd3e708064d37b1b1c4bbd\nparticl-0.21.2.9-aarch64...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]Earlier this\nweek, we pre-released Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9], a release\nfocused on network stability, on Github. It includes a variety of SMSG network\nimprovements and also improves the stability of the blockchain's connectivity by\nbanning misbehaving peers more effectively. Follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129] \nfor the full list of changes.\n\nWhile this is still marked as a pre-release, meaning your cold staking nodes\nwon't update automatically through Partyman, we encourage you to install this\nnew version and report back to the team should you encounter any issues. It will\nbe marked as a full release shortly.\n\nParticl Electrum ✅\nRelease 4.2.1.5 Particl · tecnovert/electrum\nHashesdb67abb00dc575a4270c88cbd36105ae72355f7edc1c21830865fd8f9769afcb\nElectrumParticl-4.2.1.5-arm64-v8a-release.apkf8df945d44de292395cdc20452931fa12d2fd2a1fa9352a794e76be74ab8da15\nElectrumPart...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl]We've also\npushed a minor cosmetic fix\n[https://github.com/particl/electrum/commit/f1b8c13636c9ffcf6fd37a03340d4eff2d7f0354] \nto Particl Electrum mobile which changes the display of staking transactions\nfrom a negative fee to a correctly marked staking reward.\n\nTo that effect, we pushed, a few hours ago, new mobile builds (.apk) for Android\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl] that fix\nthis issue.\n\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute\nto particl/particl-core development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]As usual,\nvarious code adaptions and merges have been done as part of our ever-ongoing\nprocess of keeping Particl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You\ncan always keep track of those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nAs a reminder, while this task may appear \"mundane\" on the surface, it is vital\nfor the deployment of certain functionalities that are critical to the success\nof our ecosystem. \n\nFor example, Taproot, which is now available on Particl, is poised to become an\nimportant feature of the upcoming BasicSwap DEX. By not keeping the Particl Core\ncodebase up-to-date with the ongoing Bitcoin developments, integrating such a\nmajor feature would not only be very messy and time-consuming, but it would also\npotentially be unsafe as it would be missing important dependencies.\n\nWhat keeping up with the Bitcoin codebase allows Particl to do is to leverage\nall the new exciting updates, features, and functionalities of Bitcoin and\nintegrate them, when and if needed, into our wider ecosystem in a timely and\nsafe manner.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe do not have anything in particular to mention this week on BasicSwap other\nthan what was mentioned in last week's report. We are still working on\nfinalizing the DEX's user interface and it is the current main focus of our\ndesigner and lead UI/UX, Gerlof van Ek.\n\nExclusive Episode of the Super Dangerous Club\nYou're probably already aware of the Super Dangerous Club, the weekly show by\nParticl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe Fisher. They talk about\nvarious topics touching on technology, geo-politics, futurism, and more. \n\nLast week, they focused their episode on the Particl project and Particl\nMarketplace. If you're a fan of Particl, then this one is an episode you must\nnot skip.\n\nWhile the episode itself is not yet released anywhere other than on Clubhouse,\nwe thought of sharing it here in advance for our weekly progress update readers\nonly.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms.

You can always keep track of those changes by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\">this link</a></strong>.</p><p>As a reminder, while this task may appear \"mundane\" on the surface, it is vital for the deployment of certain functionalities that are critical to the success of our ecosystem. </p><p>For example, Taproot, which is now available on Particl, is poised to become an important feature of the upcoming BasicSwap DEX. By not keeping the Particl Core codebase up-to-date with the ongoing Bitcoin developments, integrating such a major feature would not only be very messy and time-consuming, but it would also potentially be unsafe as it would be missing important dependencies.</p><p>What keeping up with the Bitcoin codebase allows Particl to do is to leverage all the new exciting updates, features, and functionalities of Bitcoin and integrate them, when and if needed, into our wider ecosystem in a timely and safe manner.</p><h3 id=\"basicswap-\">BasicSwap ?</h3><p>We do not have anything in particular to mention this week on BasicSwap other than what was mentioned in last week's report.

We hope to resolve the other two issues by the end of this coming\nweekend, or early into the coming week.\n\nOnce these issues are resolved, the new messaging system for the marketplace app\nwill be ready, which means Particl Desktop 3.2 will also be ready for its\ntestnet round. We are aiming, barring any unforeseen issues, to begin the\nprocess of getting the testnet builds ready for release by mid or late next\nweek. We will keep you updated about the process.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nParticl Core 23.0 ✅\nThis week on Core, we've started the week on a strong foot by pre-releasing \nParticl Core 23.0.1.0 (RC2)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.1.0rc2]. If you're\ncurious enough to test it out, you can download it from Tecnovert's personal\nrepository, but know that this release is not yet officially supported by the\nteam (experimental) and is reserved for advanced or adventurous users only.\n\nRelease Particl Core 23.0.1.0 RC2 · tecnovert/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/23.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md#2301Hashes78e28b677d3a9115b5359ccb4f20a72177813f52ad183bdb9033ee0b30628c5c\nparticl-23.0.1.0rc2-x86...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.1.0rc2]Frozen\nHeart ❄️ ?\nThere has also been a bit of drama related to a vulnerability found in some\ncoins' implementation of RingCT and its Bulletproofs protocol improvement.\nDubbed Frozen Heart, the vulnerability, ethically disclosed by the Trail of\nBits, allowed for the forging of zero-knowledge proofs, rendering the protocol's\nsoundness void. \n\nWhile the Trail of Bits team did not mention Particl in the list of affected\nprojects, we've built a few tests of our own to verify beyond a doubt whether\nthis would affect Particl or not. We are happy to finally report that, after\nproper testing and investigation, we can confidently say that Particl is safe\nand unaffected by this vulnerability.

In fact, cold staking pools that were using\nmulti-signature addresses (i.e., coldstakingpool.com\n[https://coldstakingpool.com]) had been affected by a bug that prevented the\nautomated distribution of staking rewards after the release of Particl Core\n0.19.2.19. \n\nThis bug has been resolved yesterday, cold staking pools operators have been\nnotified of the fix, and rewards have already been successfully distributed to\nstakers that are staking on pools that have since then made the update. The\napplied fix has for bonus effect to make cold staking pools significantly\nfaster. You can check out the fix here\n[https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/commit/09aecddc1f9078f20e2bb57342270a04fc63f6e9]\n.\n\nv0.21, compact leveldb, use rapidjson, abort on failure, show pending ·\nparticl/coldstakepool@09aecddPooled coldstaking demo.

We'll share more details as soon as possible.\n\nCore Maintenance and More Onion Seeds ?\nAs is usual, we've worked on maintaining Particl Core up-to-date with recent\nBitcoin changes. We've also added a bunch of new onion seeds into Core which\nshould make routing your Particl connection through Tor more stable. You can\nhave a look at the new seeds here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/46f780a4e93425a1e8f90c4da169ffaf5a4b6497]\n.\n\nnet: Add onion seeds · particl/particl-core@46f780aParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree.

And while Particl Core 0.19 has been\nvery stable for Particl, it's high time to move the remaining of the network\nthat isn't yet running 0.21 to this version.\n\nThis will improve the reliability of Tor routing on Particl by unifying the\nversion of Tor's protocol being used.\n\nSoonTM Development Ltd Spending Report\nSoonTM Development Ltd is the legal entity supporting the Particl team. It is\nwhat holds custody and manages the funds claimed from the network's Treasury by\nthe Particl team.\n\nFollowing community requests, a spending report has been released on the \ncompany's website [https://soontm.io/]. You can consult it by following this\nlink [https://soontm.io/spending].\n\nAs was mentioned in the proposal, because little was spent on marketing at the\ntime of the first cycle, the funds that were allocated to this have been\ndeposited into the team's reserve for later use.\n\nThe spending report for the second funding cycle (and subsequent cycles alike)\nwill be available on the website, in the same way as this report, shortly after\nthe end of it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

And\nboy has this week been a busy one with the release of several updates both to\nParticl Core and Particl Desktop.\n\nSo let's not waste any time and jump right into the crux of this update!‌\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nThis week has been championed by the release of two very important updates to\nParticl Desktop [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-3-released/]. Indeed,\nan odd issue surfaced in which marketplace listings were not being received and\ndecrypted by other peers of the network.

This\nweek, we've got some exciting development on the side of Particl Desktop, with\nits new version finally nearing the beginning of the testnet round of testing!\n\nLet's jump right in and get into these details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week we've seen significant progress with the upcoming messaging system\nthat will be added to the marketplace. Dare we say that it is...right around the\ncorner? ?\n\nIn fact, it is now nearing completion, with the majority of the work in Particl\nDesktop being now completed. As it stands now, there are only a couple of issues\nthat still need to be addressed and one or two additional features that still\nneed to be implemented relating to the messaging. Still, those are minor\ncompared to the work that's already been done on that end.\n\nFor example, the ability to save a label, like a name or an identifier, to a\nparticular chat address still needs to be added to the desktop client; a feature\nthat should take no time to add. \n\nIn addition, there are still a couple of non-messaging issues that we've come\nacross that need to be looked at. By fixing these, along with the\nnow-quite-impressive number of improvements and bug fixes since our last desktop\nclient update, you can guess that Particl Desktop 3.2 is going to have a much\nbetter user experience and feel much smoother, especially for vendors who've\nsubmitted a non-negligible list of feedback, comments, and suggestions! Thank\nyou all for your constant reports; they help immensely in improving Particl!\n\nWith all of the above in mind, the focus for next week will be to complete all\nof the messaging-related changes (final desktop client implementation issues and\nfinal additional features) and do the final internal testing of the entirety of\nthe messaging implementation. We'll also strive to finish off the other\nnon-messaging issues. \n\nAnd so, we hope to be able to initiate the building process for Particl Desktop\n3.2 towards the end of next week or early into the following week. Regardless of\nwhen that process starts, expect a thorough update on the matter in next week's\nprogress report!\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've rebased the PartPayServer based on a request from a\npotential new partner to use the latest version of Particl Core. That means the\npayment server is now compatible with Taproot!\n\nFor those who don't know, PartPayServer is a payment module that can be\nintegrated into any website to accept both Bitcoin and Particl payments. The\npayment module can be integrated onto almost any website or platform or be added\nto any WooCommerce shop using the BtcPayServer plugin (cross-compatible with\nPartPayServer). \n\nIf you would like to accept Bitcoin or Particl payments on your website or\nonline shop (not hosted on Particl Marketplace), we recommend getting\nPartPayServer here [https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver].\n\nGitHub - tecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor.Accept Bitcoin payments. Free,\nopen-source & self-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor. - GitHub -\ntecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin pa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver]You'll find all the required\ndocumentation on setting it up here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver/blob/master/README.md]. Additionally,\nif you want to install and run the WooCommerce plugin, refer to this document \nhere [https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/]. Although the documentation is\nmade for BtcPayServer, PartPayServer is completely cross-compatible with the\nplugin and will work without issue. Just make sure to enable the Separate\nPayment Gateways setting to accept PART and get to the api key from btcpayserver\nby going to: Account -> Manage account -> api keys. It's listed in the next\nsection after automatically setting up the api key. Finally, for this to work,\nyou'll need to set up your own store and wallets in PartPayServer.\n\nAside from this rebase, the rest of the focus has gone towards keeping the\nParticl codebase up-to-date with Particl Core, as is usual.\n\nBroadcasting Lower Market Listing Fees\nAs most of you know, the size of the Particl Marketplace listing fees is\ndependent on what the network wishes to see. Anyone who stakes PART can\nbroadcast their fee preferences and influence the rate with which the\nmarketplace bases its listing fees.\n\nSince the fee broadcasting feature was fixed and re-enabled on our last\nhardfork, the community has lowered listing fees significantly. Indeed, we've\nseen a 66.6% decrease in listing fees, going from a target fee rate of 20,767 to \n6,935 at the time of this writing. So how does that translate into real-world\ndata? Let's check it out.\n\nFor this example, let's assume a seller sells 100 items over 30 days. He\naverages three high-quality images and a reasonable description length in each\nlisting. Thus, this example assumes an SMSG message size of around 0.5 MB. In\ntotal, after a month's worth of listing with PART's value set at $0.80), the\nseller would have paid $83.22 in total. Note that because there is no sales fee\nor any other eCommerce-related fee on the platform, that is all the seller will\npay, regardless if sales are made or not. However, the fiat valuation of the\nlisting fee does change depending on the PART price.\n\nWith this data on hand, now you're in a better position to judge whether or not\nyou want to broadcast lower or higher fee target rates. If you'd like to change\nyour preferences, we invite you to read the blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] and change your\npreferences accordingly!\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing FeesAdjust the Particl Marketplace listing fees\nusing your staking power.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This week, we've had the pleasure of seeing the\nlong-anticipated release of Particl Electrum and have been making steady\nprogress on the various components that make our current primary focus.\n\nLet's get into the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week regarding Particl Desktop, has seen its focus split into two fronts.\n\nOn the in-market messaging front, we're continuing to make progress on the inbox\nsystem. We're currently nearing completion of its integration into the ordering\nprocess (buy flow), and once that is complete, we'll start on its listing-based\nintegration.\n\nAside from work being done on the new messaging system, we've received a few\nissue and bug reports from some of the vendors currently operating on the\nmarketplace. This has led to the discovery of a couple of issues in the\nmarketplace codebase, as well as the addition of additional functionalities.\n\nFor this reason, we've seen a temporary decrease in the number of listings\ncurrently published on the marketplace as some of the sellers, some of which\nhave encountered similar issues, are waiting for them to be resolved before\nrelisting. In some cases, the changes can be made locally, and so we expect some\nmore listings to come back up even before the next release of Particl Desktop\n3.2.\n\nBasicSwap and Particl Core Progress Update\nThis week has seen the long-anticipated release of Particl Electrum, the light\nwallet which lets you manage your PART wallets without having to sync the entire\nblockchain. As such, two releases have been made this week with the second one\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/] adding the ability to\ncold stake funds stored on Electrum using Partyman as well as introducing the\nability to send funds to stealth (private) PART addresses.\n\nParticl Electrum 4.2.1.4 AvailableCold stake funds held on Particl Electrum\nusing Partyman and send funds to stealth addresses.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/]But as mentioned,\nmanaging funds through the Particl Electrum client is merely scratching the\nsurface of what we intend to do with it. Indeed, its back-end codebase provides\nlight services that can be used to make distributed applications more\naccessible. In Particl's case, it becomes notably useful for future web and\nlight releases of BasicSwap and the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, large merges have been made from Bitcoin's upstream code into\nParticl Core. You can see a list of the most notable additions since the new\nParticl Core 23.0 update by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/41d2a75f89f80ecc6ed35a642b83db0d61a9f44e/doc/release-notes-particl.md#next-major-version]\n. As always, these changes are critical to keep Particl's code as secure and\nmodern as possible.\n\nparticl-core/release-notes-particl.md at\n41d2a75f89f80ecc6ed35a642b83db0d61a9f44e · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree.

That means that it'll be possible to activate the\nadditional layer of privacy that Tor offers either when first setting up the\nclient or later on by manually routing its connection through the onion layer.\nAlong with this notable privacy update, we've updated the DEX's Bitcoin node to\nwork over the more recent 22.0 version.\n\nAs for its user interface, we are still making steady progress, and it is the\ncurrent main focus of Particl's designer Gerlof van Ek. We will keep you updated\nand will provide additional information about its release timeframe as soon as\nwe are able to.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving. None of it would be possible without you\nall!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend we'll see you all back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This week, we've been trucking along the various components on\nour plate and have been making steady progress, bringing us closer to delivering\non some major items.\n\nLet's get into the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nWe're happy to announce that we have finished up the marketplace-related code\nfor the upcoming messaging system! What remains to be completed is the UI and\nthe integration into Particl Desktop, which is currently the main focus.\n\nIn the coming week, we'll likely be finishing up the UI changes for the\nOrders-related messaging and then also work towards finishing up the UI for the\nlisting-related messaging. \n\nAnd so, with that in mind, it is safe to say that the more challenging parts of\nthis significantly crucial new feature are now mostly done and behind us.\n\nAdditionally, we've been busy making minor fixes and improvements based on user\nfeedback. As such, Particl Desktop 3.2 is expected to run much more smoothly and\ninclude a wide variety of improvements to the desktop client and the marketplace\ncodebase. Again, thanks to all users taking the time to report bugs and feedback\nto the team; it is instrumental in making the product as good as possible!\n\n> Note: As is usual for any major Particl release, Particl Desktop 3.2 will be\nreleased on testnet prior to going live on mainnet. This will make it possible\nfor a larger pool of testers to play around with the new release and ensure that\nit remains stable under a wider range of environments.\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nThis week on core, we've completed all development and testing for the upcoming\nlight wallet Particl Electrum. \n\nHowever, within the last 24 hours, an upstream update to one of the packages\nrequired to build the Windows client received an upstream update that broke the\nprocess. This made building the Windows client not possible until some point\ntoday where it was fixed by the Electrum team\n[https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/commit/8559d1eb723c8c462c3d2a7365967ada46ef21c5]\n. With this issue now resolved, we will be able to launch the building process\nbefore the end of the day and release Particl Electrum once that is complete! \n\nThis is a great milestone for Particl because, as you may know by now,\nElectrum's back-end is intended to become a cornerstone of Particl's broader\naccessibility ambitions, notably by enabling Particl Marketplace and the\nBasicSwap DEX to be deployed on and accessed from the web.\n\nIn other words, using Particl Electrum as an end-user wallet is only scratching\nthe surface of what it's intended to be.\n\nAside from this, we've been pursuing the work mentioned in last week's update\nregarding BasicSwap and the merging of Bitcoin 23.0 into Particl Core, as is\nusual.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below.

weekly progress report.\nThis week has once again been a continuation of the various components being\nworked on with steady progress being made on all fronts.\n\nWithout further ado, let's jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, the upcoming marketplace messaging system that allows buyers and\nsellers to message each other has been the sole focus. While progress may seem\nslow on that end, it is steady, and we can report that the main hurdles are\nlikely now out of the way.\n\nNext week, we'll be making some related changes to the marketplace codebase and\nputting more focus and emphasis on the UI component of this messaging system.\n\nThe in-market messaging layer is currently the main focus and the last remaining\nmajor item before we can go live with the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nParticl's upcoming light wallet, Particl Electrum, is currently in its last\ntesting phase. We can report that no major issue has been encountered so far\nsince we've started this final round of testing; it's been smooth sailing, and\nthat is an excellent indicator. Particl Electrum should be ready to be released\nnext week!\n\nAs for BasicSwap, we are making outstanding progress both on its user interface\nand codebase. Indeed, we're currently improving various aspects of the codebase\nbut, perhaps more interesting for this update, adding Tor functionality to it as\nwell.\n\nIndeed, once initially released, it will be possible to launch BasicSwap and\nroute it either through \"clearnet\" or through Tor. Furthermore, this option is\navailable right from within the installation process. That means you won't have\nto launch BasicSwap first to adjust this setting, allowing you to avoid\ndeploying your node on either clearnet or Tor if you need to avoid doing so\n(i.e., in some countries, you may want to avoid simply connecting to the Tor\nnetwork).\n\nAbout the user interface, we fully intend on making it as user-friendly as\npossible so that most people can get started quickly and reap its benefits\nwithout needing to be an \"advanced user\". This is a common mistake with\ncross-chain DEXes that often leads to a lack of adoption. To that end, we are\nworking on making the user interface expand on BasicSwap's core functions and\nbring the user experience to a level more similar to what you would expect from\n\"traditional exchanges\". \n\nWe'd also like to mention that, even though we are calling this upcoming launch\nan \"open beta\", the release will be fully functional and let you easily swap\nassets like Bitcoin, Monero, and Particl on their respective mainnet networks.\nDon't be fooled by the \"beta\" status of BasicSwap; we are calling it this way\nbecause we have a much broader vision for it going into the future. Its first\nbeta release should already be smooth enough to become your go-to exchange.\n\nFinally, we've also made good progress on bringing the Particl code up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin's latest version (23.0), and we should have a release ready for it,\nwith the new guix framework, quite soon. As always, this is an ever-ongoing task\nbut still requires a fair amount of effort every week.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below.

This week has been a continuation of the various components being worked\non with steady progress being made on all fronts.\n\nLet's jump right into the crux of this update!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, good progress has been made on the marketplace messaging system. As a\nreminder, this system allows for two transacting parties (the buyer and the\nseller) to communicate at any point in time during a transaction. This is the\nlast remaining item before Particl Desktop 3.2 is ready to be released and is\nthe current primary focus of Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer.\n\nAdditionally, two issues that were reported by current active users of the\nmarketplace have been resolved. They are as follows.\n\n 1. Fixing the removal/deleting of images from a template in the marketplace.\n    This issue has been successfully resolved.\n 2. The very first startup of PD at times failed to save the relevant\n    configuration to the core particl.conf file, and then would have all the\n    changes written to the particl.conf on the on 2nd startup. This would result\n    in a potential reindex of the blockchain on the 2nd startup and possible\n    issues on that first use of PD/particl-core.\n\nGoing into next week, working on the messaging system will remain the primary\nfocus as we head towards the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nWhen it comes to Particl Core, a lot of work has gone into merging all the\nlatest changes made to Bitcoin 23.0 into Particl. This is an ever-ongoing task\nand you can follow the progress at any point in time by monitoring the Particl\nCore repository on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nCommits · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.

We are currently testing\nthe client extensively to ensure the integration works as intended. \n\nAdditionally, a few general improvements over the original Electrum codebase\nhave been added in, notably as we intend to use Particl Electrum as the back-end\nfor many of what we have planned moving forward (i.e., web or mobile framework). \n\nNote that, if you prefer using Particl on your mobile device, you'll be happy to\nknow that Particl Electrum comes along with a mobile application. And while its\nupstream interface is rather basic, we'd like to remind you that the primary\ncenter of interest here when it comes to Particl Electrum is the back-end\ncapabilities that it provides. As such and moving forward, its codebase will\nallow for the development of better mobile applications based on it, which could\nserve as solid replacements for the current Particl Copay application.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms.

In this week's report, we're providing a bit more information about the\nupcoming BasicSwap DEX and its open beta release timeline, so if you had\ninterrogations about it, be sure not to miss this section!\n\nWithout further ado, let's jump right in. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've wrapped up the new product code functionality which gives the\nability for sellers to better categorize and update their products.\n\nIt allows for a seller to uniquely identify their items according to their own\npredefined system. Note that this has no impact on the buyer side as the product\ncodes are not publicly displayed along with a listing; they simply exist to\nprovide some assistance to sellers in terms of inventory management. It will\nalso allow us to introduce, in the future, additional features to provide more\nthorough product updates via CSV import or alternative methods using product\ncodes as unique identifiers.\n\nOther than that, we've applied a few UI improvements to Particl Desktop, both on\nthe marketplace and desktop apps, as was suggested by current vendors.\n\nGoing into next week, the in-market messaging system (buyer - seller inbox) will\nbe the sole priority and we expect to wrap it up soon, after which Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release.\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've dealt with a tricky issue regarding integrating cold\nstaking and cold staking pools into the upcoming Particl Electrum wallet. This\nissue is still being actively resolved and is the current main focus at this\ntime for Particl's core developer Tecnovert.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Progress Update\nWe've received a few questions this week regarding Particl's upcoming\ncross-chain and private DEX; BasicSwap. As mentioned previously, we are\ncurrently working on the user interface of the protocol. This is the last\nremaining item before its open beta is ready to be released, but it's a critical\none nonetheless as it will largely contribute to the first impression people\nwill have about it. That's twice as true for any user that isn't currently a\nParticl community member (and we absolutely want to welcome them as part of our\nawesome community). That's the reason why we want to spend the proper time to\nensure that the user interface is as optimal and simple to use as possible.\n\nIndeed, in the last few years, we've seen many attempts at decentralized\nexchanges. One of the most recurring reasons why some of them do not see great\nsuccess is because they are too complicated to use for the \"common user\". \n\nTurns out, simplicity is one of BasicSwap's strengths. Indeed, it doesn't\nrequire any complicated terminal operations to function (other than the initial\nsetup, which is only temporary until proper builds are released), and all\nfeatures and functions are fully accessible from a web browser (even though it's\nstill a local application). \n\nBut to reach its full potential, it needs to be properly supported by a simple\nyet powerful user interface. And because the sheer number of features and\noptions available can get confusing for the casual crypto user; we're taking\ngreat care of building an easy-to-use but also eye-candy user interface. After\nall, we do not want to limit our user base to the technically advanced and\ngeeks; we want any crypto user to be able to benefit from a private,\ndecentralized, and no BS trading exchange that's not after their money or data. \n\nIt's important, however, to keep in mind that the first version of BasicSwap\n(its open beta) is only the first step towards a more ambitious goal. Although\nwe are confident that the open beta itself, which will run on mainnet, will\ngather a good number of users on its own, the real game-changer comes once we\nsuccessfully complete a more flexible framework we're working on.\n\nIndeed, we are working, right at this moment, on a flexible framework that would\nmake it easier for anyone to leverage the BasicSwap protocol and deploy the\nsystem on other platforms (i.e., Particl Desktop, a website, cryptocurrency\nwallets, etc). Once that is complete, that's when we expect BasicSwap to really\nshine and be integrated by partners and other players within the blockchain\nindustry. That's directly in line with our inclusive and non-tribalistic\napproach; a decentralized, free (as in freedom), and private ecosystem built for\nthe benefit of all.\n\nBut as for the progress being made on the user interface of the open beta\nitself, we have been making very good progress on it specifically within the\npast two weeks. We can confirm it is the current main focus of Particl designer\nGerlof van Ek and we expect to be able to start teasing the UI soon enough.\n\nKeep an eye out for any update on Particl News as BasicSwap is the next big\nthing to attach itself to the Particl ecosystem.

This issue is still being actively resolved and is the current main focus at this time for Particl's core developer Tecnovert.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-dex-progress-update\">BasicSwap DEX Progress Update</h2><p>We've received a few questions this week regarding Particl's upcoming cross-chain and private DEX; BasicSwap. As mentioned previously, we are currently working on the user interface of the protocol. This is the last remaining item before its open beta is ready to be released, but it's a critical one nonetheless as it will largely contribute to the first impression people will have about it. That's twice as true for any user that isn't currently a Particl community member (and we absolutely want to welcome them as part of our awesome community). That's the reason why we want to spend the proper time to ensure that the user interface is as optimal and simple to use as possible.</p><p>Indeed, in the last few years, we've seen many attempts at decentralized exchanges. One of the most recurring reasons why some of them do not see great success is because they are too complicated to use for the \"common user\". </p><p>Turns out, simplicity is one of BasicSwap's strengths. Indeed, it doesn't require any complicated terminal operations to function (other than the initial setup, which is only temporary until proper builds are released), and all features and functions are fully accessible from a web browser (even though it's still a local application). </p><p>But to reach its full potential, it needs to be properly supported by a simple yet powerful user interface. And because the sheer number of features and options available can get confusing for the casual crypto user; we're taking great care of building an easy-to-use but also eye-candy user interface. After all, we do not want to limit our user base to the technically advanced and geeks; we want any crypto user to be able to benefit from a private, decentralized, and no BS trading exchange that's not after their money or data. </p><p>It's important, however, to keep in mind that the first version of BasicSwap (its open beta) is only the first step towards a more ambitious goal. Although we are confident that the open beta itself, which will run on mainnet, will gather a good number of users on its own, the real game-changer comes once we successfully complete a more flexible framework we're working on.</p><p>Indeed, we are working, right at this moment, on a flexible framework that would make it easier for anyone to leverage the BasicSwap protocol and deploy the system on other platforms (i.e., Particl Desktop, a website, cryptocurrency wallets, etc). Once that is complete, that's when we expect BasicSwap to really shine and be integrated by partners and other players within the blockchain industry. That's directly in line with our inclusive and non-tribalistic approach; a decentralized, free (as in freedom), and private ecosystem built for the benefit of all.</p><p>But as for the progress being made on the user interface of the open beta itself, we have been making very good progress on it specifically within the past two weeks. We can confirm it is the current main focus of Particl designer Gerlof van Ek and we expect to be able to start teasing the UI soon enough.</p><p>Keep an eye out for any update on Particl News as BasicSwap is the next big thing to attach itself to the Particl ecosystem.

This week, we've made some good progress in improving both Particl\nDesktop and Particl Core, so let's look into it right away.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer has suffered a minor injury\nthat took time off of major tasks. With this context in mind, he focused on\nsmaller (but needed) and easily deliverable improvements proposed by some of our\nmarketplace sellers.\n\n 1. In the wallet transaction list, transactions that have been abandoned will\n    now be properly displayed instead of showing the current \"0/12\n    confirmations\" indicator. Users will also be able to abandon transactions\n    right from Particl Desktop.\n 2. A filter to the \"batch publish\" modal has been added. It lets sellers filter\n    the visible products by published market, enabling them to more easily\n    republish listings when they have multiple markets and many items (with\n    items specific to particular markets). In short, it provides them the option\n    to only show items belonging to a particular market, rather than searching\n    through all the items across all the markets one by one. In some cases, it\n    can save several minutes, if not hours, especially when it comes to large\n    vendors who often update their inventories and regularly add new items.\n\nLooking forward to the coming week, we'll be able to resume progress on product\ncodes and hopefully wrap it up before the end of the week. Then, we'll continue\nworking on the in-market messaging system to get it ready for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop 3.2 update.\n\nParticl Core Development Update\nThis week, we've added some improvements and bug fixes to the Particl Core 0.21\ncodebase. Notably, an issue was fixed where the wallet can freeze when unlocking\nafter receiving an anon transaction while locked.\n\nIf the user then closes the wallet (unaware that it's stuck), it leads to errors\ncreating future transactions with AddAnonInputsFailed. This issue is now fixed\nas part of Particl Core 0.21.2.7, which is available as a pre-release here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.7].

To\nmake that happen more quickly, we will initially release this feature on vendor\nnodes only (no GUI integration).\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nAs for Particl Core, most of the week has been spent improving Particl Electrum\nand fixing a few reported issues. We're happy to report that Particl Electrum is\nnearing its official release and will be made available from both desktop and\nmobile devices. \n\nAdditionally, core's default ring size has also been adjusted to match the\ndefault value of Particl Desktop, improving privacy by unifying the values of\ndecoys.\n\nOn the topic of privacy, we invite you to read an important blog post we've\npublished this week on Particl News. It details our vision for the project, what\nrole privacy plays into it, and why we've designed PART's privacy setup the way\nwe did.
