While this integration is still in the testing phase and not yet\nready for a full production roll-out, it represents a major step forward and has\nbeen updated on BasicSwap's dev Github branch.\n\nOur next focus is addressing the management of change during the conversion from\nregular LTC to MWEB balances. Currently, the change from such conversions also\nbecomes MWEB but remains in the regular address instead of transitioning to\nMWEB. Resolving this will be one of our main goals in the coming week.\n\nNew Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've recently rolled out updates for two coin cores: Firo and Litecoin. As\nalways, we strongly recommend that you keep your core nodes updated to the\nlatest versions, which is particularly important in this instance as both Firo\nand Litecoin have upcoming hardforks — Firo with the introduction of Lelantus,\nand Litecoin with the full integration of MWEB.\n\nFor guidance on how to update your coin cores, please refer to the step-by-step\ninstructions provided in the Particl Academy here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nWe've successfully completed testing BasicSwap's installation wizard version 2.0\nfor Windows last week and are now testing it for OSX. It is nearly ready to\npre-release it.\n\nAs a new addition, the updated installer now lets you update the DEX, and also\nincludes additional scripts to update its dependencies and launch the\napplication (not just install it) by double-clicking on an icon.\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe are making steady progress on finalizing version 2.1 of BasicSwap's user\ninterface, and need a few extra days to finish everything up. \n\nNote that, this week, we've incorporated changes to the user interface to\nsupport the new Litecoin balance types. Additionally, we've made the necessary\nmodifications to accommodate multi-wallet functionality, which will be required\nif coin cores need this feature.\n\nMiscellaneous ✅\n * Investigate and fix issue with wallet unlock getting stuck at \n   SecureMsgWalletUnlocked\n * Make BasicSwap multi-wallet capable\n * Rename rpc_callback -> call_rpc\n\nPrivacy Coins Getting Delisted ⚡️\n> #Monero [https://twitter.com/hashtag/Monero?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] and\nother #privacy\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] coins like \n#DASH [https://twitter.com/hashtag/DASH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] or #FIRO\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIRO?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] will soon be\ndelisted from most if not all major centralized exchanges\n\nBut fear not!

This was highlighted this week by the actions of several\nexchanges either delisting privacy coins or demanding the addition of\ntransparent features, limiting their privacy aspects.\n\nWe want to reiterate that BasicSwap DEX stands firm in its commitment to user\nprivacy. It will never ask you to verify your identity, impose arbitrary limits\non you, nor will privacy coins ever be delisted. The DEX is designed to be\ncompletely resilient, operating without centralized control or interference.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, with planned milestones such as web compatibility, light\nnodes, remote services, and more coin listings, the year promises to be a\nsignificant one for BasicSwap. These developments will not only enhance the DEX\nbut also contribute significantly to the ongoing fight for our privacy and\nfreedom.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable (December 23, 2023) ?️\nIn case you weren't able to catch it live, we've uploaded our latest Privacy\nRoundtable, featuring our friends from PIVX and Firo, to our YouTube channel.\nThe last session was particularly interesting as we delved into the impact of\nAI's advancement on our privacy and were honored to have a co-founder of the\nZano project join us for the discussion.\n\nIf you haven't had the chance to listen to this insightful conversation yet, we\nhighly recommend checking it out. \n\nYoutube Playlists ?️\nWe'd like to take a moment to highlight the fact that we now curate playlists on\nour Youtube channel, making it easier for you to find content that's most\nrelevant to your interests. \n\nThese playlists cover a variety of topics including Particl Marketplace,\nBasicSwap DEX, general information about our project, as well as a compilation\nof recent appearances, interviews, and talks we've participated in.\n\n * Discover our playlists: https://www.youtube.com/@Particl/playlists\n\nDr. Kap's Youtube Channel ▶️\nIf you like watching or listening to Particl's advisor Dr. Kap, you'll be\npleased to learn that he now has a Youtube channel which aggregates past and\nfutures appearances.\n\n * Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@drkap1\n * Last interview of John McAfee with Dr. Kap and CryptoRamble: \n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBDFRJSfLCA&list=PLd-1ipx0nhF_Tr1k6T22h8js9joekOAPg\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBDFRJSfLCA&list=PLd-1ipx0nhF_Tr1k6T22h8js9joekOAPg]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe are still rectifying a minor issues and incorporating modifications based on\nthe feedback we have received since the introduction of Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nAs a reminder, we've identified a particular issue involving order processing on\nParticl Marketplace, meaning that you may encounter issues accepting orders,\nprogressing through escrow steps, and properly submitting bids to sellers. We\nare currently investigating that issue and will incorporate its fix in the\nupcoming Particl Desktop 3.3.1 release.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ?\nWe are still at the early stages of building the seller app and have been\npreparing for its development cycle, collecting feedback and suggestions from\nsome of the vendors currently selling on the marketplace at the same time.\n\nNotably, this week we've been working on the capability of the seller app to\nwork with plugins along with an external group of developers that is exploring\nthe feasibility of building a liquidity engine specifically designed to support\nsellers on the marketplace.\n\nIf you have any seller-related feature requests, suggestions, or ideas, we'd\nlove to hear about them. The app provides a quick way to deploy and experiment\nwith different seller-related features, so the more input we receive on that\nend, the more we can work with!\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've pushed a couple of commits to BasicSwap's codebase while a\ncouple of others are still pending submission. \n\n * Accepted bids will timeout if the peer does not respond within an hour after\n   the bid expires.\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md#0060]\n * Ensure messages are always sent from and to the expected peer addresses.\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md#0060]\n\nWe're currently in the process of wrapping up a few changes/fixes to BasicSwap\nbefore shifting more priority to the next key milestone, SMSG 2.0. You can track\nthe progress as it happens here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nSMSG 2.0 is indeed a critical item towards our vision of an independent,\nprivate, and pro-liberty economy as it provides Particl dApps like BasicSwap and\nthe marketplace the required level of scalability to support widespread\nadoption. Moreover, it will facilitate the availability of Particl dApps over\nthe clearweb (\"Web2\"), as well as from its very own and decentralized web\nenvironment.\n\nWe will keep you updated on this topic and publish multiple articles explaining\nSMSG 2.0 in more details on Particl News once its development cycle officially\nbegins.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've unfortunately been unable to release the new BasicSwap GUI this week as we\nhave been working on resolving some bugs, notably in relation to its dark theme.\nWe've fixed the good majority of them today and are wrapping up the last pieces\nfor imminent release.\n\nAs we mentioned last week, the new GUI will be released in two phases, the first\none comprising of the revamped GUI codebase, including the features announced in\nprevious progress reports, and the second one introducing a set of features that\nhave been requested by the community only recently. This includes, for example,\nindicators highlighting what orders can be taken partially.\n\nAs part of this second release, we also want to explore more experimental\nfeatures available on the codebase, but not yet the GUI, such as the grouping of\norders, which would allow orders of the same rate to be \"merged as one\" on the\norder book, but whether they will be able to be released at this stage, or\nwhether it is too early, is yet to be determined.\n\nMarket Making Script ✅\nWe've completed the majority of the work in relation to BasicSwap's market\nmaking script. While stile basic in itself, it allows you to easily maintain\nliquidity on BasicSwap without having to manually complete several steps.\n\nThis involves, notably, automatic republishing of orders onto the book,\nautomatic price adjustments based on current market rates (with programmable\ncustom profit margins for arbitrage), automatically bidding on orders that meet\nspecific criteria, and so forth.\n\nAt present, we are in the process of connecting our market making script to a\nliquidity provider partner. This will enable you to maintain a constant ratio of\nbalances (e.g. BTC, XMR, etc.) when carrying out swaps on the platform. To put\nit simply, you will have the capacity to offer liquidity for different assets\nwhilst ensuring the balances stay relatively the same as you use BasicSwap, thus\nallowing you to benefit from the margins without having to manually adjust your\nbalances every time.\n\nWe are also assessing other options for providing liquidity, such as connecting\nBasicSwap with other market making systems such as Hummingbot, for example, but\nthis is slated for a later time this year.\n\nParticl & PIVX on Twitter Space Later Today ?️\nToday this Friday at 2:30 PM, Particl and PIVX will be live on Twitter Space \ndiscussing current events in the crypto market and the role of privacy in\nachieving personal liberty.\n\n> Thrilled to be hosting a live Space with @_PIVX\n[https://twitter.com/_PIVX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] and @thegreatestdoc\n[https://twitter.com/thegreatestdoc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] this Friday at 2:30 PM\nEST!\n\nJoin us as we discuss #PIVX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/PIVX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw], @BasicSwapDEX\n[https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw], and explore the\nsignificance of #privacy\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] for our\nliberties ?\n\nMake sure to stay for the Q&A https://t.co/vy7Z8x5jBh… https://t.co/5wJCCTKX49\n\n— Particl (@ParticlProject) March 5, 2023\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1632471154895077382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nBe sure to join us in this discussion and ask any question you may have in the\nQ&A period towards the end of the stream!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
