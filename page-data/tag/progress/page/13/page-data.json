The first category, Global Settings, are\nclient-wide settings that regulate the entire Particl Desktop client. These\nsettings are effective for all wallets and contain options like enable UPnP,\nconnect clients via proxy, or choose the client’s language (for those who prefer\ntheir client not to display text in English).\n\nThe second type of settings, Wallet Settings, are parameters that are effective\nonly within the specific wallet on which they have been set up. What it means is\nthat when changing preferences within the Wallet Settings page, the changes only\napply to the wallet you’re currently in. Changes will not affect other wallets\nand each one can have its independent parameters. An example of wallet-specific\nsettings would be Notifications Settings, where you can specify what you want to\nbe notified of (payment received, pending orders, staking rewards, new\nproposals, etc).\n\nAs it stands today, all the technical changes that were required for the Global\nSettings are now completed. The team is now busy with tweaking the GUI/front-end\nto display the new changes correctly and to easily allow for the updating of\nthese parameters as well as the addition of new options, in the future.\n\nOpen Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is Particl’s first official Dapp. It is a decentralized and\nprivate-by-default marketplace where anyone can buy and sell stuff for crypto at\nnear-zero cost and without leaving a trace.\n\nMarket Management\nRead More: Market Management Tool\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nThe lowest hanging fruit for improving Particl's user experience is by making\nseveral tweaks to the user interface of…\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\n\nMarket Management is the Open Marketplace’s tool which allows anyone to create a\nshop or a personal market. This is a key component for the Open Marketplace and\nwill be a cornerstone for its adoption as it will allow more customization and\ntools for sellers (i.e. promoting listings, shops, or markets).\n\nAt this moment, the development team is working on the creation and integration\nof seller profiles. Seller profiles are a major addition coming along with\nMarket Management. They allow users to create “profiles” for each wallet. Each\nprofile has its very own “identity” and the client will offer a lot of options\nto manage profiles (i.e. a profile can be manually selected, per wallet, and can\nalso be associated with multiple markets at once). To better understand the\ndistinction between Markets, Profiles, and Identities, as introduced by the\nMarket Management tool, there’s no better explanation than the image below that\nwas put together by Juha Kovanen [https://github.com/xludx], Lead Open\nMarketplace Developer.\n\nA breakdown of Profiles, Markets, and IdentitiesAdditionally, because the Market\nManagement tool is such a big feature, and because it touches most of the Open\nMarketplace’s components, the team’s going through a significant marketplace\nrefactoring process so that the new changes can seamlessly be integrated.\n\nMystery Feature (Will be Revealed at SFBW)\nThe team has been quietly working on a secret feature which will be a major\ndriver to adoption. This feature will only be revealed on Friday the 1st of\nNovember at 11:30 am at SFBW’s Epicenter during Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe’s talk. Of\ncourse, it will be mentioned at the conferences, even before the speech, so if\nyou’re coming to SFBW or are in Vegas, you might get an exclusive scoop! This\nfeature will be a major driver to adoption for the Particl Open Marketplace and\nhas been a long-awaited addition.\n\nThe back-end code for this feature is now almost complete, with the front-end\nintegration beginning this week, if all goes well. Particl’s development team\nplans on starting the internal testing by the end of the week. While it’s likely\nthat the feature won’t be ready for release during SFBW, it will still be\nannounced regardless, even if that means that it will be released a short time\nafter the conference.\n\nOnce the feature is announced, a blog post will be published on Particl.news\nwith all the details!\n\nParticl Core\nParticl Core is the underlying blockchain protocol on which the Particl\necosystem runs.\n\nParticl’s Lightning Network\nParticl Lightning Network Now Available on Testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️ Last week, Particl's Core\nDeveloper and Cryptographer, Tecnovert …\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n\nTo make sure the Particl network can handle as many transactions as possible,\nParticl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert], has re-enabled Bitcoin-style Segwit scripts\ncompatibility with Particl Core and reverted Particl’s Lightning Network to a\nsimpler implementation that’s closer to Bitcoin’s. This will allow for a much\nsimpler implementation of Particl’s Lightning Network on mainnet and also make\nPART easier to integrate to PSBT hardware wallets\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki].\n\nWhile it’s probably going to be some time until the Lightning Network is\nrequired for Particl to handle more transactions on its network (it’s estimated\nthat the Particl network can do about 70–80 public transactions per second),\nthis is a good pre-emptive measure to ensure that the protocol is ready as soon\nas it needs to be used.\n\nIt’s important to note that the Lightning Network can be used for more than just\nscaling a blockchain network. It can, for example, be used to facilitate and\nimprove the performance of atomic swaps or conduct swaps directly on LND,\nwithout even using atomic swaps. It is expected that LND will be used, in the\nfuture, to facilitate PART swaps.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1 Pre-Released\nAlways with keeping with the latest Bitcoin Core development in mind, Particl\nCore 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] has been\npre-released on testnet and mainnet. While this isn’t particularly the biggest\nor most exciting update of Particl Core ever, it is important to keep these\nupdates coming as it makes sure Particl’s version doesn’t drift away from the\n“mother code”.\n\nIn reality, the longer you wait to update a Bitcoin-based codebase to Bitcoin’s\nlatest version, the more complicated and time-consuming it gets to update it\nlater. Additionally, it ensures that the chain benefits from all the same\nusability, performance, and security updates that Bitcoin gets.\n\nIf you feel like helping out, you can download Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] today and\nreport any bug you find on Github, that is, if you find any, of course!

This update\nincludes all the latest Open Marketplace improvements as well as two new\nmarketplace features: Question & Answers and Product Imports.\n\nQuestions & Answers: This feature allows you to ask and answer questions on a\nlisted item. The questions can be answered by anyone else as well as the seller\nof the item. When a seller replies to a question, it is marked with a special\ndesignation so that it is obvious that it is the seller’s answer to the\nquestion. The feature isn’t unlike Amazon’s very popular Q&A section on each\nlisted item’s page. This first version of the Q&A implementation does not\ncurrently include a notification system, but it will be part of a further\nupdate. A notification system for questions is already being worked on.\n\nQuestions & AnswersProduct Imports: This feature allows you to import products and inventories from\noutside sources.

It enables fast payments at a\nnear-zero fee and can scale extremely well, making it ideal to accommodate large\nnumbers of transactions per second. The Lightning Network can, in theory,\nsupport many more transactions per second than to credit card providers and\npopular online payment processors.\n\nLND will support the Particl blockchain and allow it to support large amounts of\ntraffic without being negatively impacted by it. It is an important piece for\nthe envisioned Particl technology stack and is instrumental to the network’s\nability to reach mainstream adoption.\n\nWhat the Lightning Network also enables is the decentralized, cross-chain\nexchange of cryptocurrencies. When two blockchains both have compatible\nLightning Network implementations running, cross-chain cryptocurrency trades can\nbe executed without any intermediary being required to ensure both parties stay\nhonest and honor their end of the deal. This type of exchange is very similar to\natomic swaps, but potentially more flexible.\n\nWhat are the Benefits?\nThe Lightning Network provides many benefits to the blockchains that are\ncompatible with it and opt to implement it.\n\nInstant Payments\nLightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation\ntimes. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a\nblockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in\nmilliseconds to seconds.\n\nScalability\nCapable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.\nCapacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching\npayment per action/click is now possible without custodians.\n\nLow Cost\nBy transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for \nexceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant\nmicro-payments.\n\nCross Blockchains\nCross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous\nblockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can support the same\ncryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across\nblockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.\n\n> Source: https://lightning.network/\nTest it Yourself!\nIt is now possible to test the Lightning Network yourself! Because the\nimplementation is currently pretty bare-bone, it is mostly recommended for\nadvanced users. If you would like to give it a go, use Tecnovert’s Particl LND\nscript displayed below.\n\n> Note: This script runs on RegTest (pre-testnet)\nIf you have questions about Particl LND, join our Discord channel\n[http://discord.me/particl] and look for the #testing or #Open-Development \nchannel.\n\nSo What’s Next?\nThere is still a lot to do, more stability to achieve, and more testing required\nbefore Particl LND can be used with real funds. This script lays the foundation\nof what will later become a much more user-friendly integration of the Lightning\nNetwork on Particl, but at the moment, it is still reserved for the more\nadvanced users.\n\nOne thing we are particularly excited with is the integration of Confidential\nTransactions onto the Lightning Network, or what we like to call Blinded \nLightning.

This feature has now successfully been implemented\non RegTest (pre-testnet) and is fully working\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]. Some of the Particl\ndevelopers are now using the time between now and the mainnet release to make it\nmore resource-efficient and smoother to use. As Arnold Bansemer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] says, “Better to use the time we have until\nthe release to get it done properly now rather than just enough to make it work”\n.\n\nRealigns market-beta branch with market branch by zaSmilingIdiot · Pull Request\n#1512 ·… [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]\nThis opts for the non-destructive (albeit 'muddy') commit history. This is in\npreparation for reviewing and merging of…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]\n\nThe multi-wallets feature should hit testnet somewhere this week or early next\nweek. Visit particl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826] \n later this week as we will publish a full article explaining everything there\nis to know about multi-wallets.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nDemonstrating in real-time the Open Marketplace in Hong Kong has been a very\nconstructive exercise. It showed the current V2.0 build to be pretty stable and\nable to handle hours of demonstration without really causing any issue. It has\nalso been the best opportunity we’ve ever had to test the decentralized\ngovernance mechanism of the marketplace.\n\nIn fact, while we were at the conference demonstrating the marketplace,\nundesirable products started to be listed by some testnet user. Remember, the\nOpen Marketplace is entirely decentralized. No party can singlehandedly remove\nlistings from it. Still, we wanted to keep the marketplace as clean as possible\nas we were showing it off.\n\nLuckily, the Particl testnet network is different from the mainnet network. It\nis tweaked in a way where the Particl team holds a large sum of testnet coins.\nThis is to ensure the network can run smoothly with a low number of nodes and\nthat the team can easily test the decentralized governance mechanism.\n\nWe did successfully take those listings off using the builds we had at the\nconference. This confirms and validates that the decentralized governance\nmechanism is now ready for mainnet!\n\nCT Escrow (Privacy Enabled by Default)\nThe implementation of CT transactions in the escrow smart-contract makes all\nmarketplace transactions untraceable — amounts will be hidden — by default. This\nrequires a special form of escrow that processes transactions using only CT. —\nSee OMP Library and Bitcoin 0.18 below for more info.\n\nThe Particl developers already have a working escrow in RegTest (pre-testnet)\nthat works using RingCT transactions only. By playing around with it, they\nrealized modifying it so that it could work using CT transactions (instead of\nRingCT) would be relatively easy. It would also protect the integrity of the\nproject. Particl is, after all, a privacy-focused project. It is not looking\ninto compromising privacy or security for anything else. This is why we’ve\ndecided to implement CT transactions before releasing the Open Marketplace on\nmainnet.\n\nAs it stands today, the escrow mechanism has been successfully converted to work\nwith CT transactions. The team is currently fine-tuning some of the system’s\nparameters and working on the full integration into the marketplace. This escrow\nsystem will effectively replace the one currently in place on testnet.\n\nThe good news is that most of the heavy lifting has already been done in regards\nto this task. The integration and fine-tuning processes are trivial in\ncomparison.\n\nOMP Library\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is based on the Open Market Protocol (OMP)\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/] developed by Particl developer \nKewde [https://github.com/kewde]. It is a standardized and open format\ncontaining most of the economic interactions of an online marketplace. This\nlibrary gives the Open Marketplace’s backend much more flexibility and options\nthan it currently has. While it was already implemented into the marketplace, \nits full integration is necessary for the new escrow model to function.\n\nExcept for the new CT escrow, the OMP Library will not offer any\nnoticeable/visible improvements until some point in the future. In fact, all it\ndoes is give the back-end of the marketplace more tools and parameters to\nleverage (i.e. custom listing fields\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/public-listing-format/extended/extended-listing.html]\n, escrow refunds & negotiations\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/private-message-format/overview.html]\n, etc). The library will, however, prove itself to be essential as we move\nforward into the Beta phase of development.\n\nThe OMP Library is still currently being implemented into the marketplace and\nParticl Desktop application.\n\nUI/UX Tweaks\nNew Hover Function Shows Spendable, Locked, and Total Balance Anywhere on\nParticl DesktopWhile we were presenting the marketplace in Hong Kong, we met\nmany people coming from different backgrounds and with different experiences.\nThis has generated for us a long list of feedback, comments, and suggestions,\nlots of them being about UI/UX improvements.\n\nSome of our developers have taken this list and started implementing the\nsuggestions we think will improve the user experience. These tweaks are minor\nand won’t take much time to resolve. They are not function-related issues, but\nmerely visual fixes. At this moment, The Open Marketplace’s interface is ready\nfor mainnet. These tweaks will only make it better.\n\nBitcoin Codebase 0.18\nHave you noticed that all the latest testnet versions of the Open Marketplace\nhave been running on Particl Core 0.18 while the mainnet version of Particl\nDesktop still operates on Particl Core 0.17? That’s because most of the\nmodifications we’ve made to the marketplace in the last few weeks have been\nbuilt with Particl Core 0.18 in mind.\n\nThere have been lots of issues when testing testnet (0.18) within the same\nenvironment as a mainnet wallet (0.17). This is due to a so-called “backward\ncompatibility” issue — some of the new features may need to be integrated\ndifferently on 0.17 than on 0.18. Yes, we are definitely serious when praising \nTecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert] for his amazing work. Keeping Particl’s\ncodebase, as well as everything built on top of it, up-to-date with Bitcoin’s\nlatest core version is a complex, ever-evolving, and time-consuming task.\n\nWe’ve been following the development of Bitcoin Core 0.18 very closely. We’ve\nalso been constantly preparing all the changes required for the update\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]. Earlier this month,\nthe Bitcoin developers have released the tentative release date of April 3rd for\nthe 0.18 Bitcoin update.\n\nRelease schedule for 0.18.0 · Issue #14438 · bitcoin/bitcoin\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]\nHere is a proposed release schedule for 0.18.0, the next major release of\nBitcoin Core. Like for previous major…\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]github.com\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]\n\n * Click here to read the full Bitcoin Core 0.18 Release Notes\n   [https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.18.0-Release-Notes-Draft]\n\nSince the release date of Bitcoin Core is scheduled for after the end of Q1, we\nwould need to modify a lot of components of the marketplace so that they could\nwork on Particl Core 0.17. They would then need to be reverted back to their\ninitial form (built for 0.18) only a few days after the first mainnet release.\nThis would be an unnecessarily time-consuming process that wouldn’t provide any\nadded benefit to the marketplace. This is the main driver for why the mainnet\nrelease of the “official” Open Marketplace builds will go just a few days into\nQ2.\n\nWe’ve also always said we didn’t want to release a Bitcoin codebase version\nprior to Bitcoin doing it. This is not only a mark of respect for the developers\nworking on this incredible codebase but a security measure for the Particl\nproject. This is why we always wait a couple of days before updating our\ncodebase — should there be any issue on Bitcoin’s end, we would wait for it to\nbe resolved before updating our codebase.\n\nThis is why we have taken the decision to wait for Particl Core to update to its\n0.18 version before releasing the marketplace on mainnet. Not only will this\nsave a good amount of development time (which will be used more efficiently),\nbut it will also allow developers to keep perfecting the release and run more\ntests while we wait for the Particl Core 0.18 update.\n\n> Note: The current Alpha Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 has successfully been tested\non mainnet. There hasn’t been any new identifiable issue as a result of this\ninternal test.\nGeneral Small Tweaks & Fixes\nAs always, the Particl developers are constantly making tweaks, fixes, and\nimprovements to all the components of the marketplace. This will always be the\ncase as we strive to offer the best, blockchain product in the industry, bar\nnone. Don’t forget to log any feedback, suggestion, bug, or comment on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. This is the best way to\nattract the attention of one of Particl’s developers and is the quickest way to\nmake changes happen!\n\n> NOTE: For more information about what item are being worked on and reviewed,\nplease visit the Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report/] page on\nParticl.io\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainnet Release Timeframe\nWith all the above considered, we’d like to make the mainnet release timeframe\nclearer. At this moment, we’ve successfully tested the Open Marketplace Alpha\n2.0 on mainnet, without any issue. We will, however, publicly release the first\nmainnet version of it only after Particl Core 0.18 is released —taking us into\nmid-April if the current Bitcoin release schedule\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438] sticks. That’s because we need\nto let Bitcoin Core 0.18 run on Bitcoin for a couple of days, make sure no issue\narises, update Particl Core to 0.18, and then push the Open Marketplace on\nmainnet.\n\nThe short time between now and the date of the mainnet release for the\nmarketplace will allow Particl developers to implement the changes and fixes\nidentified in TOKEN2049 as well as fine-tune and improve the initial mainnet\nfeatures (CT escrow, multi-wallets, interface, etc). This small extra time will\nalso allow them to run more tests and deliver a more stable first mainnet build.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you’ve been looking into selling and buying stuff on the Open Marketplace,\nthen now is definitely the time to get prepared! Particl is going to unlock the\nfull potential of global online commerce and will lead to the biggest revolution\nthe eCommerce sector has ever had. It only gets more exciting from this point\nonward.\n\nWe have a lot of content coming in the next few days — announcements, future\nfeatures sneak peeks, explainers, blog posts, videos, tutorials, and etc. Don’t\nmiss any of it by joining us on the awesome Particl Discord\n[http://discord.me/particl] server!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Marketplace-Development-Update/1-XhMg71IgwzJvwt1wCmxSOQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"mainnet-features-progress-outstanding-items\">Mainnet Features, Progress, &amp; Outstanding Items</h3><p>We packed our bags and headed off to TOKEN2049 last week with the Open Marketplace in tow.

It showed the current V2.0 build to be pretty stable and able to handle hours of demonstration without really causing any issue. It has also been the best opportunity we’ve ever had to test the decentralized governance mechanism of the marketplace.</p><p>In fact, while we were at the conference demonstrating the marketplace, undesirable products started to be listed by some testnet user. Remember, the Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized. No party can singlehandedly remove listings from it. Still, we wanted to keep the marketplace as clean as possible as we were showing it off.</p><p>Luckily, the Particl testnet network is different from the mainnet network. It is tweaked in a way where the Particl team holds a large sum of testnet coins. This is to ensure the network can run smoothly with a low number of nodes and that the team can easily test the decentralized governance mechanism.</p><p>We did successfully take those listings off using the builds we had at the conference. <strong>This confirms and validates that the decentralized governance mechanism is now ready for mainnet!</strong></p><h3 id=\"ct-escrow-privacy-enabled-by-default-\">CT Escrow (Privacy Enabled by Default)</h3><p>The implementation of CT transactions in the escrow smart-contract makes all marketplace transactions untraceable — amounts will be hidden — by default. This requires a special form of escrow that processes transactions using only CT. — <em>See OMP Library and Bitcoin 0.18 below for more info.</em></p><p>The Particl developers already have a working escrow in RegTest (pre-testnet) that works using RingCT transactions only. By playing around with it, they realized modifying it so that it could work using CT transactions (instead of RingCT) would be relatively easy. It would also protect the integrity of the project. Particl is, after all, a privacy-focused project. It is not looking into compromising privacy or security for anything else. This is why we’ve decided to implement CT transactions before releasing the Open Marketplace on mainnet.</p><p>As it stands today, <strong>the escrow mechanism has been successfully converted to work with CT transactions. The team is currently fine-tuning some of the system’s parameters and working on the full integration into the marketplace.</strong> This escrow system will effectively replace the one currently in place on testnet.</p><p>The good news is that most of the heavy lifting has already been done in regards to this task. The integration and fine-tuning processes are trivial in comparison.</p><h3 id=\"omp-library\">OMP Library</h3><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is based on the <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>Open Market Protocol (OMP)</strong></a> developed by Particl developer <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a>. It is a standardized and open format containing most of the economic interactions of an online marketplace. This library gives the Open Marketplace’s backend much more flexibility and options than it currently has. While it was already implemented into the marketplace, <strong>its full integration is necessary for the new escrow model to function</strong>.</p><p>Except for the new CT escrow, the OMP Library will not offer any noticeable/visible improvements until some point in the future. In fact, all it does is give the back-end of the marketplace more tools and parameters to leverage (i.e. <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/public-listing-format/extended/extended-listing.html\"><strong>custom listing fields</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/private-message-format/overview.html\"><strong>escrow refunds &amp; negotiations</strong></a>, etc). The library will, however, prove itself to be essential as we move forward into the Beta phase of development.</p><p><strong>The OMP Library is still currently being implemented</strong> into the marketplace and Particl Desktop application.</p><h3 id=\"ui-ux-tweaks\">UI/UX Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Marketplace-Development-Update/1-D6BnpiVqXou3h9LJUEKeVg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>New Hover Function Shows Spendable, Locked, and Total Balance Anywhere on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>While we were presenting the marketplace in Hong Kong, we met many people coming from different backgrounds and with different experiences. This has generated for us a long list of feedback, comments, and suggestions, lots of them being about UI/UX improvements.</p><p>Some of our developers have taken this list and started implementing the suggestions we think will improve the user experience. <strong>These tweaks are minor and won’t take much time to resolve.</strong> They are not function-related issues, but merely visual fixes.<strong> At this moment, The Open Marketplace’s interface is ready for mainnet. </strong>These<strong> </strong>tweaks will only make it better.</p><h3 id=\"bitcoin-codebase-0-18\">Bitcoin Codebase 0.18</h3><p>Have you noticed that all the latest testnet versions of the Open Marketplace have been running on Particl Core 0.18 while the mainnet version of Particl Desktop still operates on Particl Core 0.17? That’s because most of the modifications we’ve made to the marketplace in the last few weeks have been built with Particl Core 0.18 in mind.</p><p>There have been lots of issues when testing testnet (0.18) within the same environment as a mainnet wallet (0.17). This is due to a so-called “backward compatibility” issue — some of the new features may need to be integrated differently on 0.17 than on 0.18. Yes, we are definitely serious when praising <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a> for his amazing work. Keeping Particl’s codebase, as well as everything built on top of it, up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest core version is a complex, ever-evolving, and time-consuming task.</p><p>We’ve been following the development of Bitcoin Core 0.18 very closely. We’ve also been <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\">constantly preparing all the changes required for the update</a>. Earlier this month, the Bitcoin developers have released the <strong>tentative release date of April 3rd </strong>for the 0.18 Bitcoin update.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><strong>Release schedule for 0.18.0 · Issue #14438 · bitcoin/bitcoin</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><em>Here is a proposed release schedule for 0.18.0, the next major release of Bitcoin Core.

They would then need to be reverted back to their initial form (built for 0.18) only a few days after the first mainnet release. This would be an unnecessarily time-consuming process that wouldn’t provide any added benefit to the marketplace. This is the main driver for why the mainnet release of the “official” Open Marketplace builds will go just a few days into Q2.</p><p>We’ve also always said we didn’t want to release a Bitcoin codebase version prior to Bitcoin doing it. This is not only a mark of respect for the developers working on this incredible codebase but a security measure for the Particl project. This is why we always wait a couple of days before updating our codebase — should there be any issue on Bitcoin’s end, we would wait for it to be resolved before updating our codebase.</p><p>This is why <strong>we have taken the decision to wait for Particl Core to update to its 0.18 version before releasing the marketplace on mainnet.</strong> Not only will this save a good amount of development time (which will be used more efficiently), but it will also allow developers to keep perfecting the release and run more tests while we wait for the Particl Core 0.18 update.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The current Alpha Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 has successfully been tested on mainnet.

At this moment, <strong>we’ve successfully tested the Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on mainnet, without any issue. </strong>We will, however, publicly release the first mainnet version of it only after Particl Core 0.18 is released — <strong>taking us into mid-April</strong> if the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><strong>current Bitcoin release schedule</strong></a> sticks. That’s because we need to let Bitcoin Core 0.18 run on Bitcoin for a couple of days, make sure no issue arises, update Particl Core to 0.18, and then push the Open Marketplace on mainnet.</p><p>The short time between now and the date of the mainnet release for the marketplace will allow Particl developers to implement the changes and fixes identified in TOKEN2049 as well as fine-tune and improve the initial mainnet features (CT escrow, multi-wallets, interface, etc).

The Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 has just been\nreleased on Github and is now available for all to play with.\n\nThis version is going to be unlike other testnet versions we’ve seen in the\nrecent past. Unlike our testing community builds that expire after 10 days, this\nstable build will be available for download on the website, as well as in the \nRelease [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] page of our\nParticl Desktop Github repository.\n\nThis is also the build that the team will be demonstrating at next week’s \nTOKEN2049 conference\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b] \n in Hong Kong.\n\nWe’d also like to take this opportunity to give you all a small update on Alpha,\nBeta, and the upcoming mainnet release of the marketplace! But first, let’s get\ndown to the details about this testnet release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started With V2.0\nDownload and get started with testing the Open Marketplace by following this\nGithub link:\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]\n\n> Client Version: 2.0.0-alpha-testnetMarket: v0.0.51\nParticl Core: v0.18.0.4\n\nTestnet Faucet (get free testnet coins): http://faucet.particl.xyz/\n\nPlease, continue logging any issue you may encounter on the Issue section\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] of our Github page.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImportant Note\nFor those of you that have tested the marketplace on testnet a long time before, \nyou will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you will\nencounter errors. This will be sorted out in the future but is highly\nrecommended for the moment.\n\nIf you’ve been testing the more recent marketplace community builds, then that\nstep shouldn’t be necessary anymore, although if you encounter any problem,\nclearing your marketplace database is always a good option to fix most issues.\n\nThe location of your particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\nWindows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n\nmacOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n\nLinux:~/.particl-market\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog\n * New logo\n * Bug fixes\n * Stability improvements\n * No download link expiry\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSoft Rebrand\nAs we are moving forward, the project is going to go through a soft rebrand,\nwith today’s release being the first step towards that process. As you probably\nnoticed, this marketplace build now features a brand new logo instead of the old\none. The soft rebrand refreshes the color palette and logo of the project. We\nwill be releasing another blog post later today explaining the details of this\nsoft rebrand and the reasoning behind it.\n\nAlpha, Beta, and the Way Forward\nEarlier this week, we mentioned we were targeting today to be the final date for\nthe Alpha version. This was intended to be this way so that we could time the\nend of the Alpha phase of development with the TOKEN2049 conference. However,\nwhile a portion of our developers was fixing bugs and improving the stability of\nthe build, the other portion made some significant progress on a couple of other\nfeatures that we would like to integrate into Alpha.\n\nFor this reason, we have taken the decision to extend the Alpha phase of\ndevelopment for a few days in order to bring these features on the Alpha build\nand ensure that they are part of our first mainnet version. These features are:\n\n * Multi-wallet capabilities\n * Blinded escrow\n * OMP Library\n\nMulti-wallet: This feature adds the ability to manage multiple wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is useful for both usability and, most\nimportantly, security. Wallets managed by the same unique Particl Desktop are\nentirely isolated from each other, meaning no data is shared between wallets.\nThis will allow buyers, vendors, and users to set multiple profiles and enhance\ntheir security setup.\n\nBlinded escrow: While RingCT and Bulletproofs are available on testnet, they are\nnot available on mainnet. For this reason, and because we’re first and foremost\na privacy project, we’ve opted to integrate CT transactions right into Particl’s\nescrow. Because we already had an escrow system integrated with RingCT on\nRegtest (pre-testnet), we’ve decided to substitute RingCT for CT and bring that\nmodification onto testnet. Progress made on that front has been super fast, and\nfor this reason, we’ve decided to launch our first mainnet version with CT\nescrow enabled by default, effectively making the Open Marketplace private by\ndefault from Day 1. This won’t be as strong as RingCT escrow, but it sure is\nmultiple times more private than a simple pseudonymous escrow setup.\n\nOMP Library: The OMP Library is a protocol that brings various enhancements and\nattributes to the back-end of the marketplace. It is a requirement to\nsuccessfully implement CT escrows and also adds a couple of security-related\nenhancements to it. The attributes it adds will be able to be leveraged by\nParticl Desktop in the future to put more information in listings and better\ncategorize products. For more information about the OMP Library, head over to\nits documentation by following this link: \nhttps://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\n\nBeta & Mainnet\nFollowing the implementation of these features, Alpha will end and Beta will\nstart immediately thereafter. At the same time, Alpha will move up to mainnet as\na private by default marketplace from Day 1. This Alpha phase of development\nextension shouldn’t affect the targeted release timeframe for mainnet too much,\nif at all, but it will bring features that will significantly increase the value\nand privacy of the product itself. In other words, we are still aiming for a\nmainnet release before the end of Q1 2019.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of this in mind, stay tuned for a new testnet build that should contain\nthe newly introduced multi-wallet feature within the next week or so. In the\nmeantime, you can now enjoy the super Particl Open Marketplace V2.0 and share it\nwith your friends and peers without any fear that the links might expire!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Alpha-V2-0-Release---Development-Update/1-4UH5cHbZBKAPH1DIlBuatw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>It’s finally here!</strong> The Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 has just been released on Github and is now available for all to play with.</p><p>This version is going to be unlike other testnet versions we’ve seen in the recent past.

This hardfork will port two testnet features onto mainnet: multi-signature\ncold staking and paid SMSG. Because hardforks are a pretty big deal, it is\nimportant for you to prepare your nodes in prevision of this event so that you\nare not left staking on a deprecated chain. Luckily, the whole preparation\nprocess is extremely easy.\n\nDevelopment Update - Planned Hardfork Schedule - Particl News\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n2019.02.16-12:00:00 UTC In 4 days, on the 16th of February, we're going to fork\nParticl's test network (testnet) to…\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Prepare\nThe only thing you need to make sure is that the nodes you are running are\nupdated to Particl Core 0.17.1.3, or, at the very least, Particl Core 0.17.1.2. \nAny version prior to this one will not be compatible with the hardforked chain\nand will therefore make you stake on the wrong chain. This will make all of your\nstaking rewards invalid and any transaction made on that wrong chain will not be\nreflected on the hardforked chain. In other words, you absolutely need to update\nyour node before the hardfork if you wish to use PART post-hardfork.\n\nHere’s how to do it, depending on the client you use.\n\nParticl Desktop | Particl Qt/cli | Partyman | Cold Staking Pool | Particl Copay \n| On Exchange\n\nI. Particl Desktop\nIf you’re using Particl Desktop, then lucky you, because it is the easiest of\nall clients to update. Running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and beyond means your\nwallet will automatically notify you as soon as there’s a new Particl Core\nversion available. All you have to do after getting this notification is close\nyour Particl Desktop wallet and reopen it. Your Particl Core daemon should\nautomatically update upon reopening the client.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, even if you are running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and\nbeyond, it is recommended to manually check if the wallet has properly updated.\nThere shouldn’t be any issue, but you can never be too careful when a hardforks\ncoming.\n\n.Additionally, if you are running a Particl Desktop version older than 1.3.1,\nthen we highly recommend, as always, upgrading to the latest version\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb] as it fixes\nvarious issues, bugs, and contains many improvements.\n\nDownload Particl Desktop 1.3.1: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1\n\nParticl Desktop 1.3.1 Announcement & Changelog: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\n\nII. Particl-Qt & Particl-cli\nIf you’re running either Particl-Qt or Particl-cli, then you will need to\nmanually download and install the latest version of Particl Core. Simply visit\nthe Particl-Core Github release page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/] and download the latest\nversion.\n\nNote: The latest Particl Core version is 0.17.1.3, not 0.17.1.2. However, as\nlong as you run a Particl Core version that is equal or more recent than\n0.17.1.2, you will have no issue with the hardfork. Particl Core 0.17.1.2 is the\nMINIMUM version required for your to follow along with the network’s hardfork.\n\nDownload Particl Core 0.17.1.3: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\n\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\n\nIII. Partyman (Cold Staking App)\nIf you are using Partyman to cold stake your funds, then whenever you enter a\ncommand within the app, it should automatically prompt you to install the newest\nversion. In order to properly update your node, you will first need to upgrade\nyour Partyman app, then update your Core. In order to do this, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Go into your Partyman folder (cd /root/partyman)\n * Type the command git pull. This will update the Partyman app.\n * Once done, update Particl Core by typing./partyman update\n * Accept the update by typing y\n * Once updated, restart your Particl Core by typing./partyman restart\n * Accept the restart by typing y\n\nIV. Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are cold staking from a pool, you don’t need to do anything other than\nupdate whatever wallet you use to access your funds. Usually, this would be\nParticl-Qt or Particl Desktop. Refer to the instructions above to properly\nupdate.\n\nIf you are a pool operator, you will need to update both the Particl Core and\nthe packages of your pool. Follow these steps:\n\n * First update your pool’s packages: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_old_install_to_package.txt\n * Then, update your Particl Core: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.txt\n\nV. Particl Copay Wallet\nIf you are using Particl’s mobile application, Particl Copay, then you don’t\nneed to do anything. The nodes Particl Copay connects to will automatically\nupdate in time for the hardfork.\n\nVI. Coins on Exchange\nIf your coins are stored on an exchange, then you don’t need to do anything. The\nexchange will update its nodes in time for the hardfork. Exchanges and other\nthird-parties running Particl nodes have already been made aware of the upcoming\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be equipped to navigate any standard\nissue during or after the hardfork. If you have any question, don’t hesitate to \njoin our Discord [https://discord.gg/YFeXbFZ] server and ask your questions in\nthe #support channel. We’ll be happy to help you out!\n\nIn the meantime, we can’t wait to go through this hardfork and add to Particl’s\nnetwork these two awesome features!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/March-1st-Hardfork---How-to-Prepare/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As many of you know, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0\"><strong>PART mainnet network is going to undergo a hardfork on the 1st of March 2019</strong></a>.

During this time, the team and community\ntesters have been hard at work identifying & fixing the last of the small issues\nstill present in the latest testnet builds.\n\nWith a stable build nearing completion, it is imperative to prepare our main\nParticl Network blockchain for the addition of a privacy-focused decentralized\nmarketplace. The first step is a code update that will allow decentralized\ngovernance to work properly (with coin weight) and requires hardfork. Ahead of\nthis, and a non-event for most users, will be a hardfork of our Particl test\nnetwork as well.\n\nHere are the things you need to know.\n\nPlanned Hardfork Schedule\nTestnet Fork (Particl Core 0.18)\n⭐️ 2019.02.16 —12:00:00 UTC\n\n * VARIABLE SMSG FEE\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n * BULLETPROOFS\n\nMainnet Fork (Particl Core 0.17)\n⭐️ 2019.03.01 —12:00:00 UTC\n\n * PAID SMSG\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTestnet Hardfork (16th of February)\n> 2019.02.16–12:00:00 UTC\nIn 4 days, on the 16th of February, we’re going to fork Particl’s test network\n(testnet) to merge a couple of features that have been sitting in RegTest\n(internal pre-testnet network) for some time now. This hardfork doesn’t require\nyou to do anything but, of course, it will allow you to test these new features\non our public testnet.\n\nBulletproofs\nThis testnet hardfork is going to include Bulletproofs, the Confidential\nTransactions protocol improvement that will reduce the size of CT/RingCT\ntransactions by ~70%. Bulletproofs is an important brick in Particl’s wall of\nprivacy as it will allow RingCT and CT transactions to be executed without\nbloating the blockchain and bringing its size to absurd levels. We believe\nprivacy and scalability can and should go hand in hand.\n\nWhy make compromises when you can have the best of both worlds?\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nAs some of you already know, we are already working on a major new feature to\nour mobile app, Particl Copay; Cold staking capabilities!

This development update will explain in more details what is being\nworked into Particl Copay and what can be expected from the next few versions of\nParticl’s mobile application.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMobile Cold Staking\nOne of the big feature being coded into Particl Copay is the long-awaited cold\nstaking capabilities. In fact, it will soon be possible to connect your funds to\na cold staking node directly from your mobile application and help secure the\nnetwork while growing your PART stash at the same time. Note that, in this case,\nthe Particl Copay mobile wallet won’t be the device actually staking. The update\nwill only enable the possibility to cold stake your funds held on Particl Copay\nby delegating its staking power to a cold staking node.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nWhat if Particl’s Proof-of-Stake algorithm could be taken yet to another level?\nThis is what this next feature is going to do! Not only will Particl Copay’s\ncold staking update introduce the ability to connect your mobile wallet to a\ncold staking node, but it will also introduce multi-signature\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions] \ncold staking. This will allow you to stake your funds held in multi-sig\naddresses, requiring you to have access to more than one device to successfully\nauthorize and execute a transaction.\n\nFor the time being, this will only be compatible with Copay devices. This may or\nmay not change in the future, although the team has already identified ways to\nmake it compatible with Ledger hardware devices. As this feature requires a\nhardfork, it won’t be included in the next update of Particl Copay.\n\niOS Support\nAnother long-awaited feature for Particl’s mobile wallet is official support for\niOS. As many of you know, especially iPhone users, Particl Copay hasn’t been\navailable on iOS since its inception, but that’s about to change! The mobile\napplication has already started to see its code being upgraded\n[https://github.com/particl/copay/commits/master] to be compatible with iOS and,\nat that point, we are only waiting for Apple to confirm Particl’s Apple\nDeveloper Account. When that’s done, we’ll be able to publish the application on\nthe App Store whenever the update is ready to go live! This compatibility update\nshould be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nMulti-Currency Support\nA very useful feature that’s gonna be included in the next update is the ability\nto hold different coins in Particl Copay without having to use multiple wallet\napplications. Indeed, once the update goes live, Particl Copay will have support\nfor Particl, but also Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This should prove very useful\nwhenever Particl’s Open Marketplace starts accepting Bitcoin payments! This\nupdate will be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nUI/UX Improvement\nThose of you already using Particl Copay will notice it right away, this update\nwill introduce several UI/UX improvements all over the app. There is not much to\nsay about this in particular other than the fact that the mobile application has\nbeen improved visually and will offer all of its new features within a very\nuser-friendly and intuitive environment. This update will be available in the\nnext version of Particl Copay.\n\nNotifications\nVarious types of notifications will also be introduced in this update. Whether\nit be incoming or outgoing transactions, staking rewards, or multi-sig\ntransaction requests, the mobile app will now notify you whenever something\nhappens within the app. This update will be available in the next version of\nParticl Copay.\n\nCopay Wallet Emptying Vulnerability Fix\nWhile the current version of Particl Copay isn’t affected by the newly\ndiscovered exploit\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitpays-copay-wallet-compromised-by-malicious-code-firm-issues-advice-for-users] \nthat allowed attackers to empty Bitcoin Copay wallets due to a faulty Node.js\nmodule, this exploit has been revealed to be effective on recent versions of\nBitcoin Copay. This critical vulnerability will be fixed and not be present in\nthe new Particl Copay version.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this new Particl Copay update.\nThis will bring much needed and requested features to the mobile application and\nreally make this wallet a powerful tool both in terms of utility and security.\nSince this is just a development update and not a proper announcement blog post,\nwe recommend you to watch the developments being made to the mobile application\nby going on its Github repository [http://github.com/particl/copay], or to\nsimply keep an eye on our blog [http://particl.news] for any future release\nannouncement.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to see more development updates?

All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins\nand still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but\nsmaller, staking rewards.\n\nCold Staking Pools\ntecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\nPooled coldstaking demo. Contribute to tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]github.com\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\n\nThe reason Particl’s staking pools are called cold staking pools is that they\noperate in the same way cold staking does. Cold staking allows you to delegate\nyour staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf,\nbut without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows\nyou to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to\nyour coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked,\nalthough not obligatory).\n\nIn that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that\nallows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your\ncoins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is\nimportant because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t\nactually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is\nactually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight\npossessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. Cold staking\npools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!\n\nNote: You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a\nLedger Nano S hardware device. This will make your funds impossible to steal\neven when unlocking your wallet from an infected or compromised computer. To\nlearn more about this, read the “The Ultimate Vulnerability” section of this\nblog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]. To\nlearn how to connect your funds stored on a Ledger Nano S hardware device to a\nstaking pool, follow the instructions in this tutorial\n[https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac] \nand, instead of using a cold staking node public key, use the public key given\nto you by the cold staking pool.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Are Cold Staking Pools Going to Benefit the Particl Network?\nIn short, it’s going to make staking much more accessible and practical to\neveryone, regardless of the number of coins you hold or your level of expertise.\n\nStaking With Fewer Coins\nIn fact, staking with only a small PART balance is not ideal because of the size\nof each staking reward (~1.25 PART at the time of this writing). To put that in\nperspective, consider the moment 1 PART was worth around $50. If you wanted to\nbuy $1,000 worth of Particl, that would have given you around 20 PART. Back\nthen, the staking interest rate was 5%. This meant that, after one full year of\nstaking, you would have earned around 1 PART staking on the network, a yearly\nreward that is smaller than the payout size. In other words, chances are high\nthat you wouldn’t even have received a single reward during the entire year even\nthough you helped secure the network the whole time. This phenomenon is not\nunlike “solo mining” with a poor GPU on Proof-of-Work networks.\n\nNow, with cold staking pools, you could “team up” with the other stakers\nconnected to the same pool as you and get a share of the staking rewards earned\nby the pool proportional to how much you’ve contributed to it. Instead of\nwaiting a long time to receive one large staking reward, you would receive\nsmaller but more frequent rewards. This makes staking much more interesting and\ninteractive, and also makes staking with fewer coins more stable and reliable.\n\nEasier to Set Up for Non-Technical Users\nAnother obstacle to cold staking is the technical level required to set up a\ncold staking node. Although not overly complicated, especially when following \nthe cold staking node setup tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4], it\ndoes require time and effort to correctly execute. It also generally requires\nthe use of a staking device like a Raspberry Pi or a VPS server, all of which\nadds up to the difficulty and hassle of setting cold staking up.\n\nOn top of that, staking devices need to be maintained quite regularly: you need\nto make sure it is up 24/7, you need to ideally keep it updated to the latest\nParticl Core version (especially when there are hardforks), and you need to make\nsure it is properly restarted when, for example, there is a power outage or\nsomething that makes the electricity go off.\n\nFor a lot of users, especially the less technical ones, the dedication it takes\nto set cold staking up and maintain its device is simply too much. Cold staking\npools, on the other hand, do not require you to prepare and manage a staking\nnode since that part is taken care of by the pool operator. Enabling cold\nstaking has never been as easy as with cold staking pools, and it shouldn’t take\nmore than 2 minutes off of your time!\n\nMore Coins Being Staked\nBecause of how much it would benefit some types of users, cold staking pools are\nlikely to encourage more people to stake their coins. This will benefit the\nnetwork by having fewer available coins on the markets, meaning it would be much\nharder for an attacker to acquire large sums of PART coins and try to damage the\nnetwork with a 51% attack. In Proof-of-Stake networks, more coins being put up\nfor staking means it is more secure.\n\nNote: Staking pools do present a risk to the network if misused. In fact, while\nthey make 51% attacks harder to execute by reducing the number of coins\navailable on the markets, they could also potentially end up staking 51% of the\ntotal network supply if users are not careful enough. As such, we encourage as\nmany people within the community to come up with their own cold staking pools\n(the source code is openly available here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]) in order to create many\ndifferent options for users which would lead to a better decentralization of the\nstaking supply.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts\n * You can still vote on Community Proposals and flag listings while your funds\n   are connected to a cold staking pool.\n * The pool operator cannot vote on your behalf, nor can he flag listings using\n   your coin weight.\n * Records can be obtained to verify the pool’s operator integrity.\n * Payout threshold (the total amount of PART you need to accumulate within the\n   pool before a payout is executed) is set up by the pool operator and can be\n   changed at any time.\n * In the future, pools might be able to read specially formatted control\n   transactions, meaning smart-contracts could potentially interact with them.\n * In the future, research might be done to integrate the Lightning Network to\n   cold staking pools, which would allow an almost infinite number of\n   micro-payouts per day (i.e. multiple payouts throughout the day of 0.01\n   PART). This may or may not happen depending on the need and feasibility of\n   such a feature.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started Today!\nConnect to a staking pool today and start reaping its benefits in less than 2\nminutes!

All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-pools\">Cold Staking Pools</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><strong>tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><em>Pooled coldstaking demo. Contribute to tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool development by creating an account on GitHub.</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\">github.com</a></p><p>The reason Particl’s staking pools are called cold staking pools is that they operate in the same way cold staking does. Cold staking allows you to delegate your staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf, but without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows you to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to your coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked, although not obligatory).</p><p>In that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that allows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your coins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is important because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t actually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is actually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight possessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. <strong>Cold staking pools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!</strong></p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake protocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a Ledger Nano S hardware device. This will make your funds impossible to steal even when unlocking your wallet from an infected or compromised computer. To learn more about this, read the “The Ultimate Vulnerability”</em><em><strong> </strong></em><em>section of </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><em><strong>this blog post</strong></em></a><em>.

To put that in perspective, consider the moment 1 PART was worth around $50. If you wanted to buy $1,000 worth of Particl, that would have given you around 20 PART. Back then, the staking interest rate was 5%. This meant that, after one full year of staking, you would have earned around 1 PART staking on the network, a yearly reward that is smaller than the payout size. In other words, chances are high that you wouldn’t even have received a single reward during the entire year even though you helped secure the network the whole time. This phenomenon is not unlike “solo mining” with a poor GPU on Proof-of-Work networks.</p><p>Now, with cold staking pools, you could “team up” with the other stakers connected to the same pool as you and get a share of the staking rewards earned by the pool proportional to how much you’ve contributed to it. Instead of waiting a long time to receive one large staking reward, you would receive smaller but more frequent rewards. This makes staking much more interesting and interactive, and also <strong>makes</strong> <strong>staking with fewer coins more stable and reliable</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"easier-to-set-up-for-non-technical-users\">Easier to Set Up for Non-Technical Users</h3><p>Another obstacle to cold staking is the technical level required to set up a cold staking node. Although not overly complicated, especially when following <a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><strong>the cold staking node setup tutorial</strong></a>, it does require time and effort to correctly execute. It also generally requires the use of a staking device like a Raspberry Pi or a VPS server, all of which adds up to the difficulty and hassle of setting cold staking up.</p><p>On top of that, staking devices need to be maintained quite regularly: you need to make sure it is up 24/7, you need to ideally keep it updated to the latest Particl Core version (especially when there are hardforks), and you need to make sure it is properly restarted when, for example, there is a power outage or something that makes the electricity go off.</p><p>For a lot of users, especially the less technical ones, the dedication it takes to set cold staking up and maintain its device is simply too much. Cold staking pools, on the other hand, do not require you to prepare and manage a staking node since that part is taken care of by the pool operator. <strong>Enabling cold staking has never been as easy as with cold staking pools, and it shouldn’t take more than 2 minutes off of your time</strong>!</p><h3 id=\"more-coins-being-staked\">More Coins Being Staked</h3><p>Because of how much it would benefit some types of users, cold staking pools are likely to encourage more people to stake their coins. This will benefit the network by having fewer available coins on the markets, meaning it would be much harder for an attacker to acquire large sums of PART coins and try to damage the network with a 51% attack. In Proof-of-Stake networks, more coins being put up for staking means it is more secure.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>Staking pools do present a risk to the network if misused. In fact, while they make 51% attacks harder to execute by reducing the number of coins available on the markets, they could also potentially end up staking 51% of the total network supply if users are not careful enough. As such, we encourage as many people within the community to come up with their own cold staking pools (the source code is </em><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><em><strong>openly available here</strong></em></a><em>) in order to create many different options for users which would lead to a better decentralization of the staking supply.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"quick-facts\">Quick Facts</h2><ul><li><strong>You can still vote</strong> on Community Proposals and flag listings while your funds are connected to a cold staking pool.</li><li>The <strong>pool operator cannot vote on your behalf, nor can he flag listings </strong>using your coin weight.</li><li>Records can be obtained to verify the pool’s operator <strong>integrity</strong>.</li><li>Payout threshold (the total amount of PART you need to accumulate within the pool before a payout is executed) is set up by the pool operator and can be changed at any time.</li><li>In the future, pools might be able to read specially formatted control transactions, <strong>meaning smart-contracts could potentially interact with them.</strong></li><li>In the future, research might be done to integrate the <strong>Lightning Network</strong> to cold staking pools, which would allow an <strong>almost infinite number of micro-payouts per day</strong> (i.e. multiple payouts throughout the day of 0.01 PART).

It presented itself as a great\nopportunity for the team members to meet the co-workers they’ve been working\nwith for some time (and in some cases, years), as well as being the perfect\nopportunity to get as many heads working together and brainstorming as possible.\n\nThere’s one thing that is absolutely sure and that definitely stands up the\nminute these meetings start: the level of expertise, knowledge, and passion\nwithin the team is simply out of this world! On their own, each of the team\nmembers is quite impressive in terms of skills. When they get together, however,\nthat’s when the magic happens.\n\nGetting Particl Marketplace Beta Ready\nThe meetings were, for the most part, exclusively focused on the development and\nmanagement of the project with a particular look on the short to mid-term.\n\nThe development team first focused on what needed to be done more urgently in\nregards to the finalization of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. Suffice\nto say, we are definitely getting to the very end of the Alpha stage of\ndevelopment and only minor tweaks and additions (notably linked to software\nstability and governance) are still left to add. While that is not necessarily\nfresh news, it does confirm that we might only be weeks away from the release of\nthe long-awaited Beta version of the marketplace, on testnet first of course.\n\nIt was also discussed that Particl Marketplace Beta might release initially as a\nLite Beta, then followed by more frequent than now Release Candidates, each of\nthem adding a new feature not present in the previous version. For example, it\nis very likely that the very first Release Candidate of Particl Marketplace Beta\nmight not contain RingCT/CT privacy features integrated into the escrow system\nas Tecnovert is still working on improving the RingCT protocol with\nprivacy-enhancing tweaks as well as Bulletproofs.\n\nIt was also heavily considered by the team that Particl Marketplace Beta, once\nstable enough and properly tested, might hit mainnet before Particl Marketplace\n1.0 is fully completed. The timeline of the mainnet release is of course not\navailable as a lot of it depends on moving targets and at how fast the platform\ncan be made stable enough to use with real money. This early mainnet period will\nbe extremely useful to test the dynamics of the many decentralized mechanisms in\nplace within the platform such as MAD escrow, anti-spam measures, governance,\nand etc.\n\nPost-Beta Items\nAnother very important task of this series of meetings was to draw an internal\nroadmap of development tasks and decide on what is going to be worked on after \nthe release of the Beta version of the marketplace. One of the decisions the\ndevelopers took was to now mostly focus on one feature at a time instead of\nworking on many at once. This will definitely help in releasing new features\nwith each Release Candidates and publish them in shorter timeframes as they are\nright now.\n\nDISCLAIMER: What follows is a list of items the development team will most\nlikely be working on after the initial release of Particl Marketplace Beta.\nItems are placed in no particular order and there is no public timeline \navailable for these. As with everything development-related, some of these items\nmay be abandoned and new ones might start being worked before others, and thus\nnone of what follows can be interpreted as “promises”. The purpose of this list\nis only to give you a general idea of what the team currently has in mind.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarketplace-Related\n> IPFS: IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System, and is a decentralized data\nstorage network\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \n(DSN). Particl Marketplace will use IPFS to store messages and data, which is\nexpected to reduce listing fees as well as increase the quality of the uploaded\ndata (i.e. listing pictures in higher quality).Note that, while IPFS will make\nit more affordable to use the marketplace, it does not provide the user with the\nsame level of privacy as SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html],\nParticl’s current default DSN. This is why the marketplace will likely default\nwith IPFS and allow to manually change the default DSN in the Settings page.\nFollow the link below to get more information about IPFS.\n\nWhat is IPFS? [https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\nIPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. At its core it is a versioned file\nsystem which can store files and track…\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]medium.com\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\n\n> Reputation System: Many of you will be happy to see this item. Vendor reputation\nis an almost necessary information for buyers when shopping online and has been\nrequested by a lot of you from the community. While the exact implementation and\nmechanism still remain unsettled for the moment, this is one of the items that\nwill eventually make its way onto Particl Marketplace.Payment Gateways: As a\ncore aspect of our vision, Particl Marketplace is designed to be a marketplace\nwhere many different cryptocurrencies are accepted. Thus, a gateway, initially\none for Bitcoin-only, will be integrated on Particl Marketplace. The initial\nintegration might probably be a third-party integration, but as proper\ndecentralized solutions rise up, expect the team to keep a close eye on them and\nwork towards integrating solutions aligned with our own vision.\nPrice Pegging: Important for a smooth user experience as well as mainstream\nadoption, price pegging is the ability to price an item according to the\ncurrency of your choice. It means a vendor could decide, for example, to sell an\nitem for $150 USD, and that item would still remain listed at $150 regardless of\nthe PART coin price fluctuation. Price pegging will also make it possible for\npeople to display posted listings in the currency of their choice.\nVendor/Buyer Communication: The ability to message the other party in a \nmutually\nassured destruction [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction] \nscenario, the game-theory scenario on which Particl Marketplace’s MAD escrow is\ndesigned), is tricky.\nOn one hand, it is necessary for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate\nbetween each other. On the other hand, it needs to be done in a way that reduces\nthe risk of the vendor blackmailing the buyer to a minimum. Ultimately, if there\nis no way for involved parties to communicate within the platform, it is simply\ngoing to be taken off-platform.\nThis is why the team has decided to craft a special communication system where\nblackmailing possibilities will be reduced to a minimum. We will give more\ndetails about the messaging system once we are getting closer to its release\nMessaging System: While not exclusive to the marketplace, the messaging system\nwill also be available, in full, but without buyer/vendor relationship. This\nwill render possible individual and group chats directly from within Particl\nDesktop, a feature that will make secure messaging as easy and effortless as\nwriting a normal message on any other application. This messaging system will be\nparticularly useful for Particl Bubble members (people possessing the Market ID\nof private/community markets) to really bond together and foster sub-communities\nwithin the marketplace itself.\nFiat Payment Gateways: Fiat payment gateways are integrations that allow users\nto pay for items on Particl Marketplace using more traditional means of payments\nsuch as a credit card. It’s important to note that, for convenience and legal\nreasons, this particular item may never make its way onto Particl Marketplace at\nany point in time. While this is an item that is being seriously considered and\nactively researched by the team, a payment solution would need to be compatible\nwith our own vision and not require the user to go through numerous tedious\nsteps in order to be integrated into Particl Desktop.\nEscrow Refunds & Recovery: One way Particl’s MAD escrow can become problematic\nis if one of the two parties isn’t able to access the smart-contract anymore,\nthus making it impossible to retrieve any funds or complete a transaction. This\nis why the team will be focused on building a refund and recovery option for the\nescrow system in order to make it more secure and resilient to unforeseen\nproblems.\nCode refactoring: As Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring] \nputs it, “code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer\ncode — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior.”. This\nrefactoring process, already underway, will make Particl Marketplace much faster\nand smoother to use. This aims at giving the marketplace the same level of\nresponsiveness you would expect from web-based platforms.\nTranslations: Not exclusive to the marketplace, translations will eventually\nmake their way onto Particl Desktop. It will then be possible for you to\nregister on the Particl translation team and contribute on making Particl\nDesktop available in your favourite language using Transifex\n[https://www.transifex.com/].\nShipping Carrier Integration: A possible, yet not guaranteed, integration the\nteam has been wanting to have is for shipping carrier information to be able to\nbe tracked directly from within the marketplace itself. In other words, this\nintegration would allow you to track your orders without having to leave\nParticl. Another good step towards convenience!\nFollow a Vendor: This self-explanatory feature will allow you the follow your\nfavorite vendors on the marketplace. The exact implementation hasn’t been\ndecided on, but it is likely that, for privacy reasons, it will be an opt-in\noption for vendors to allow their customers to follow them around.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore-Related\n> Latest Bitcoin Codebase: As always, we are committed to keeping the Particl\ncodebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s. This allows the project to benefit from all\nthe breakthroughs made to the Bitcoin codebase, some of which being directly\nincluded into this list.RingCT Improvements: As stated for a few weeks now, our\nLead Cryptographer & Core Developer, Tecnovert, has been making a few tweaks on\nthe RingCT protocol. These tweaks are specifically intended to make the RingCT\nprotocol more private than it currently is on other coins’ implementations.\nBecause of the nature of these tweaks, we cannot reveal any detail at this\nmoment as to keep the exclusivity on the improvements.\nBulletproofs: The Bulletproofs protocol improvement allows RingCT transactions\nto be dramatically reduced in size, making them cheaper to send as well as more\nlightweight on the blockchain. This will greatly help the Particl blockchain to\nstay as scalable and fast to sync as possible over a long period of time.\nLightning Network: The Lightning Network allows transactions to be sent at a\nnear-instant speed and at near-zero cost. The implementation of this protocol is\nexpected to be one of the main areas of focus for Tecnovert this year. It will\nhelp with the execution of atomic swaps, the scalability of the network, as well\nas potentially be made available with private transactions.\nSidechains: Another area of interest for 2019, as mentioned by Tecnovert, is the\nresearch and development of side-chain solutions for Particl. As defined by \nHackerNoon [https://hackernoon.com/what-are-sidechains-1c45ea2daf3], a “\nsidechain is a separate blockchain\n[https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-versus-traditional-databases-c1a728159f79] \nthat is attached to its parent blockchain using a two-way peg”. No additional\ninformation concerning sidechains on Particl is publicly available yet, so stay\non alert for more information about this in 2019!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, the South Africa team meeting has been super productive and have\nreally helped pave the way for the next few months to be impactful for the\nproject. With new developers, like Rob, jumping on board, it can only be\nexpected that the development pace is going to keep increasing as time goes. The\nteam is now really well organized with development managers and agile\nmethodologies which makes Particl’s future really look bright.\n\nP.S.: Don’t miss our blog post early next week where we will reveal a big\nconference Particl will be attending next year with a booth, a presence that was\nconcretized while we were in South Africa!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-T3ZHDBgILfKJxfTO7-ZiYg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-uvoqDP5zna4QKYLJgBLUog.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in <strong>South Africa</strong> from the <strong>16th of November to the 24th</strong> for a series of important development meetings that would shape the short to mid-term path forward for the project.</p><p>Contrary to previous meetings held in Prague and Switzerland where mostly the core group met, this one was planned to gather most of the developers as well as some members of the communications team together.

Thus, a gateway, </em><em><strong>initially one for Bitcoin-only</strong></em><em>, will be integrated on Particl Marketplace.
