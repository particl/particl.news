It introduces a significant update to the cold staking \"zap\"\nscript, hardware wallet support for Trezor devices, as well as a good variety of\nimprovements and minor fixes.\n\nYou can find more details by reading the release blog post available at this\nlink: https://particl.news/particl-core-0-19-2-13-released \n\nParticl Core Now Up-to-date With Bitcoin Core 0.22\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert has been catching up with Bitcoin's codebase\nat lightning-fast pace. In fact, Particl Core has, as of today, caught up to\nBitcoin's 0.22 code. That's a great news as it means that any delay in keeping\nup with Bitcoin's code caused by the unfortunate events earlier this year has\nnow been resolved.\n\nWhile not yet available for release (Particl always waits for Bitcoin to push\nits new versions first), you can track any 0.22 related development at the\nfollowing link: https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/tree/22.x.\n\nYou can also see what's new with Bitcoin 0.22 by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/22.0-Release-Notes-draft \n\nImport Particl Wallets From Mnemonic With the Right Cold Staking Change Address\nExtkey\nA new commit\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/8665ee5e5d6ddb5deb09809b3c4f9a6ea12b15a9] \nhas been submitted to the Particl Core repository and is tagged for the\n0.19.2.14 Particl Core release. It adds the ability for wallets to receive from\nnon-account linked extkey chains. It can be used when restoring a coldstaking\nwallet from a mnemonic and re-adding the same coldstaking-changeaddress extkey. \n\nUsually, as the added extkey is external to the wallet, its spends would not be\ndetected. This means the restored wallet would reuse keys from the start of that\nchain for any newly created transactions. Now, the coldstaking-changeaddress key\ncan be added in track-only mode and a chain rescan will detect previously used\nkeys and set the wallet with the correct value.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for your time and patience as we resolve these last few issues.

report. This week has been\none filled with progress, with solutions found and applied to all outstanding\nissues related to Particl V3. \n\nHowever, to ensure that the fixes work as intended, and before officially\nmarking them as fully resolved, we've decided to go ahead with one more round of\ncommunity testing that should begin within the next few days. That'll also allow\nthe team to monitor an interim solution that's been applied to the tricky ZMQ\nissue (more details further below).\n\nThis coming testnet round will be a public one, and we'll be putting extra focus\non testing the applied fixes with the specific people who've initially reported\nthem to ensure they're fixed on their environment. If no new problem arises,\nParticl V3 will then be ready for its mainnet release.\n\nLet's get down to the details of this week's report!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 Development Update Report\nGracefully Shutting Down the Marketplace\nThe MP service needed a means of gracefully shutting down. Before, the process\nsimply terminated, which could lead to potential issues in some edge cases.\n\nA solution has been found and applied. We'll be waiting for the coming testnet\nround to confirm this issue as fully resolved.\n\nChanging the ZMQ Node Library\nThis specific issue has proven quite problematic, mainly due to the ZMQ library\nitself. Since we've started working on it, many back-and-forths using different\nlibrary versions have happened and they've all produced errors one way or the\nother. Unfortunately, no out-of-the-box and fit-all solution has been found.\nBut, regardless, we have some good news to report.\n\nIn the interest of moving forward, we have opted to apply an interim solution\nthat will allow Particl V3 to be released with a user-friendly and enjoyable\nexperience for all operating systems. The interim solution is as follows.\n\nOn one hand, Linux and Mac distributions will be using a version of ZMQ (version\n6) that works perfectly on these platforms. Users of these operating systems\nwon't experience any sort of issue or negative performance impact when using\nParticl V3. ZMQ 6.0 is the optimal solution for these two platforms.\n\nOn the other hand, Windows build will leverage a different version of ZMQ\n(version 5.2.6) which maximizes the performance within what's possible. While\nnot entirely perfect, it works fine and will allow Windows users to experience\nParticl V3 with as fewer performance issues as ZMQ on Windows permits. This,\ntoo, is the optimal solution for Windows given what's available. This is more or\nless outside of our control, and we plan on fixing that issue as we move forward\n(keep reading for more details about this).\n\nBecause ZMQ 5.2.6 causes issues on other OSes, we've opted to use different\nlibrary versions depending on the OS. That means the code between builds\nintended for Windows and those intended for Mac/Linux will be slightly\ndifferent, which is not ideal development-wise but allows us to release Particl\nV3. As a more elegant solution, we are considering forking the ZMQ library and\ntweaking it according to our specific needs. That would ultimately provide a\nsingle solution that works across the board, but it might lead to slightly more\nmaintenance requirements until a fix for Windows appears \"upstream\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)]\". We will\ninvestigate this potential solution as we move forward.\n\nWe will be monitoring the results of the interim solution during the coming\ntestnet round and will report back if there's any change to this proposed\ntemporary solution. \n\n> Note: Not all Windows environments experience performance issues with ZMQ. Some\nWindows users will never experience any issue. For those users working within a\nWindows environment that causes performance issues with ZMQ, most of the\nproblems happen while the blockchain syncs. The issues tend to noticeably reduce\nin scope post-syncing.\nListing Template Hashes Not Properly Saved Under Specific Circumstances\nThere was an issue that could occur under a specific set of circumstances where\nthe posting of a template removed its hash, leading to problems with accepting\nbids.\n\nThis item is likely fixed now, but just like the previous two items, we want to\nwait for the results of the coming testnet round before officially marking this\none as fully resolved.\n\nParticl Core Development Update Report\nImproved Cold Staking Zap Feature Now Integrated Into Particl V3\nThe improved zap feature mentioned in last week's progress report has now been\nintegrated into the new Particl V3 build and will be available for testing\nduring the coming testnet round. \n\nWe highly encourage you to test it out and, as always, do your best to try to\nbreak it! \n\nParticl Core Merging\nAs usual, Particl Core has received many merges and updates to keep its code\nup-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. This is an ever-ongoing task that\nneeds to receive constant attention.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we near the mainnet release of Particl V3, we encourage you to test the\nupcoming testnet build and see if you can find any issue with it. \n\nFinding bugs, unexpected behaviors, and areas of improvements during testnet\nhelps straighten up Particl V3 for its mainnet release and vastly improves the\nfirst impression new users get when they first get their hands on it. While bug\ndiscovery may delay mainnet releases, they are vital in keeping Particl secure\nand appealing.\n\nAs always, we thank you all for your support and dedication. You are what makes\nParticl possible, and the entire Particl team is incredibly grateful!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

(0.19.2.13)\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13] has been\nreleased today. It introduces a significant update to the cold staking \"zap\"\nscript, hardware wallet support for Trezor devices, as well as a good variety of\nimprovements and minor fixes.\n\n * Download link: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.13 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213Hashes1d43c6f75af5daefdde50376f2cbe4e38a4683e288bbe37c9fadf9aff76ff282\nparticl-0.19.2.13-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13]As always, we\nhighly recommend keeping your node(s) and wallet(s) up-to-date with Particl's\nlatest version. If you're using the cold staking application Partyman, you can\nupdate by entering the partyman/partyman update command from your home folder or \n./partyman update from inside your partyman folder.\n\nYou can verify the full list of additions by checking out the release notes\nhere: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCold Staking \"Zap\" Feature Update\nThe zap feature lets you delegate the entirety of your staking outputs to an\nexternal cold staking node. While it has been available for several years, this\nParticl Core update improves its behavior and adds to it a new, very useful\nfeature.\n\nIndeed, it is now possible to choose whether you want your zap to be more\nprivate (doesn't use and mix inputs from different addresses in a single zapping\ntransaction) or instantly get optimal staking performances (default behavior). \n\nIt is currently possible to use the improved zap feature on Particl Core\n(although not directly supported in Particl Qt's wallet interface), but it will\nonly be available on Particl Desktop on the mainnet release of Particl V3.\nPrevious versions of Particl Desktop still work using the older version of the\nzap feature.\n\nIf you want to use the zap script without Particl Desktop, you can use this\nscript that is available on Github: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl_scripts/blob/main/zap.py.\n\nHardware Support for Trezor Devices \nThis Particl Core update also adds support for Trezor devices. Please note that\nour integration is not yet officially supported by Trezor itself, but the new\ncore update provides the code required for it.\n\nThe implementation supports incoming blind (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions,\nmeaning you'll be able to privately send your funds to your device using\nhardware hardening, but without compromising your privacy while doing so. \n\nNote that, although it supports incoming privacy transactions (from an anon or\nblind balance to a public balance), the Trezor implementation will itself only\nsupport public balances, at least for the initial implementation.\n\nWe will communicate more details about official support from Trezor as soon as\nwe can!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core 0.22 Coming Soon!\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert has been catching up with Bitcoin's codebase\nat lightning-fast pace. In fact, Particl Core has, as of today, caught up to\nBitcoin's 0.22 code. That's a great news as it means that any delay in keeping\nup with Bitcoin's code caused by the unfortunate events earlier this year has\nnow been resolved.\n\nGitHub - tecnovert/particl-core at 22.xParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/tree/22.x]As\nis tradition, and because of security, we will be waiting for the Bitcoin\ndevelopers to officially push their own 0.22 version to mainnet before doing the\nsame with Particl.\n\nFor a list of what Bitcoin's 0.22 release contains, please follow this link: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/22.0-Release-Notes-draft\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
