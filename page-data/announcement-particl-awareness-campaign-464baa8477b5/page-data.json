The Particl\nAwareness Campaign has been overwhelmingly successful in a short period of time!\nWe appreciate everyone’s effort as we’ve had more than 18,000 people\nparticipating, and 2,000 unique downloads of the marketplace. Thank you for\nparticipating, and please join https://t.me/particlawareness for any questions\nyou may have.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou and your friends are going to love using Particl!\n\nRecently, we introduced Community Contract Pools, a decentralized and\ncommunity-led program designed to fund various initiatives to raise awareness.\nWe’ve also announced that we’re kick-starting this new ‘pool economy’ by\ncreating an awareness campaign to acquire users before the imminent launch of\nour decentralized marketplace. This will be the first-ever initiative to be\nbacked by a Community Contract Pool!\n\nNow for all the nitty gritty details! We believe we’ve designed the best and\nmost innovative campaign to gain traction on our marketplace and get it started\non the right foot.\n\nEarn $PART Coins Just for Signing Up!\nGrab the products you’re looking for and pay for them with crypto!The Awareness\nCampaign’s mission is to acquire new users and kick-start the Particl economy,\nplain and simple. More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nA provably effective technique to acquire new users in the startup world is the\ntraditional referral system — get a friend to try the platform, and get some\nbenefits in return. We all know the very popular Dropbox referral model that, in\nexchange for referring friends, gives you free additional storage capacity on\nyour account.\n\nEarn More by Getting Your Friends to Sign Up!\nThe first Awareness Campaign is indeed a referral program, and it’s a damn good\none! It leverages Community Contract Pools to make it very appealing to\nparticipate in, as you’ll see. The rules are super simple.\n\nAwareness Campaign Rules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community/\n * Register with your email to start participating in the campaign\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n\nPrizes\nGetting friends to use Particl is easy! Each friend you get to sign up nets you\n1 point and points earn you prizes paid in $PART.\n\n * Get $5 worth of $PART for signing up\n * Get $10 worth of $PART when 5 of your friends sign up\n * Get $20 worth of $PART when 10 of your friends sign up\n * Get 1 lifetime staking share per additional friend that signs up (10+)\n\nHow to Claim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, all you need to do is send us, by email, a private address.\nDon’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy to acquire. Simply follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Download Particl Desktop [https://particl.io/downloads/] (mainnet)\n * Create a new account (make sure to backup your seed somewhere safe!)\n * Go to the RECEIVE tab located in the sidebar on the left\n * Click on the Private Address tab located at the top of the RECEIVE page\n * Click on the green Copy Address button to copy it to your clipboard\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\nHow to get your Particl private address and claim your rewards> Note: Payouts will exclusively be made using Confidential Transactions and\nrequire that you send us a private address. That means regular addresses, such\nas those used by exchanges, won’t work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLifetime Staking Shares as Reward\nIn fact, participants who successfully get more than 10 of their friends to use\nParticl will earn lifetime shares of the Ambassador Community Contract Pool\n[https://stake.particl.community/]’s staking revenue.\n\nYes, you’ve heard that right!\n\nIf you teach 10 of your friends about the biggest revolution eCommerce has ever\nseen and get them to sign-up, you can start earning a steady income from this\npool for life!\n\nAs mentioned above, each friend you get to use Particl gives you one point. 10\npoints get you $20 worth of PART. But what if you go above and beyond and get\n25, 100, or even 1,000 people to use Particl!\n\nThat’s where it gets interesting…\n\nIn fact, once you reach 12 points, you’ll earn yourself a single share of the\nstaking revenue made by the Ambassador Community Contract Pool. Then, for each\nadditional friend you refer, you’ll get an additional share. Simply put, you get\n(X-11) shares for every friend you get to use Particl.\n\nFor example, if you get 34 (X) people to register their email to the campaign\nand use Particl, you’ll get 24 shares (X-10). If you refer 8 (X) friends, then\nyou’ll get 0 shares, but you’ll still earn $10 worth of PART since you\nsuccessfully got more than 5 of your friends to sign up.\n\nTo learn more about staking shares and the Ambassador Pool, read our Ambassador\nPool FAQ on Particl Wiki by following the link below.\n\nfaq_ambassador * Particl Project Wiki [https://particl.wiki/faq_ambassador]\nThe Ambassador Pool is the first-ever Community Contract Pool to support an\ninitiative.

It will be back online\nwithin a few hours✌️\n\nUPDATE 2: The sign up payouts for the Awareness Campaign have been executed\nearlier today. With this, the Awareness Campaign is now resumed\n[https://friends.particl.community], with sign up payouts disabled, so that you\ncan continue earning staking shares by referring your friends to Particl. When\nyou reach 12 points, you will earn your first staking share. Each additional\npoint will reward you with a staking share.\n\nFor more details, read our latest blog post on the Awareness Campaign by\nfollowing this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-awareness-campaign-update-d94347324121\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn May 1st, we launched the first ever ambassador campaign: the Particl\nAwareness Campaign\n[https://particl.news/particl-ambassador-initiative-70dedea49eef]. The Awareness\nCampaign’s mission is to acquire new users and kick-start the Particl economy,\nplain and simple. More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nThis campaign will run until mid-July and give you the opportunity to earn\npoints that can be redeemed against PART prizes and even lifetime staking\nshares. All you need to do to start earning points it to let your friends know\nabout Particl and get them to sign up with us!\n\nRules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community\n * Sign up with your email\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\n> Note: Signing up with us will earn you 1 point.

It enables fast payments at a\nnear-zero fee and can scale extremely well, making it ideal to accommodate large\nnumbers of transactions per second. The Lightning Network can, in theory,\nsupport many more transactions per second than to credit card providers and\npopular online payment processors.\n\nLND will support the Particl blockchain and allow it to support large amounts of\ntraffic without being negatively impacted by it. It is an important piece for\nthe envisioned Particl technology stack and is instrumental to the network’s\nability to reach mainstream adoption.\n\nWhat the Lightning Network also enables is the decentralized, cross-chain\nexchange of cryptocurrencies. When two blockchains both have compatible\nLightning Network implementations running, cross-chain cryptocurrency trades can\nbe executed without any intermediary being required to ensure both parties stay\nhonest and honor their end of the deal. This type of exchange is very similar to\natomic swaps, but potentially more flexible.\n\nWhat are the Benefits?\nThe Lightning Network provides many benefits to the blockchains that are\ncompatible with it and opt to implement it.\n\nInstant Payments\nLightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation\ntimes. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a\nblockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in\nmilliseconds to seconds.\n\nScalability\nCapable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.\nCapacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching\npayment per action/click is now possible without custodians.\n\nLow Cost\nBy transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for \nexceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant\nmicro-payments.\n\nCross Blockchains\nCross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous\nblockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can support the same\ncryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across\nblockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.\n\n> Source: https://lightning.network/\nTest it Yourself!\nIt is now possible to test the Lightning Network yourself! Because the\nimplementation is currently pretty bare-bone, it is mostly recommended for\nadvanced users. If you would like to give it a go, use Tecnovert’s Particl LND\nscript displayed below.\n\n> Note: This script runs on RegTest (pre-testnet)\nIf you have questions about Particl LND, join our Discord channel\n[http://discord.me/particl] and look for the #testing or #Open-Development \nchannel.\n\nSo What’s Next?\nThere is still a lot to do, more stability to achieve, and more testing required\nbefore Particl LND can be used with real funds. This script lays the foundation\nof what will later become a much more user-friendly integration of the Lightning\nNetwork on Particl, but at the moment, it is still reserved for the more\nadvanced users.\n\nOne thing we are particularly excited with is the integration of Confidential\nTransactions onto the Lightning Network, or what we like to call Blinded \nLightning. This untraceable version of the Lightning Network will become an\nimportant piece of Particl’s technology stack and will let the public benefit\nfrom a lightning fast currency that provably respects their right to privacy!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-0sXEQ34b__FVXhqUwAGKLg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"-first-testnet-particl-lnd-transaction-successful-\">⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️</h3><p>Last week, Particl’s Core Developer and Cryptographer, <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>, successfully conducted the first ever Particl Lightning Network (LND) transaction.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/bd6f69315e9413e5f8b987fb676d192c28e8e1b15a611701bf1cdecb090f9552\">https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/bd6f69315e9413e5f8b987fb676d192c28e8e1b15a611701bf1cdecb090f9552</a> <strong>(Fee: 0.00000963 PART)</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/aa55ef38ee1f619de8ea00d02a403f2508bae87d98978d868230e8a67e804b72\">https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/aa55ef38ee1f619de8ea00d02a403f2508bae87d98978d868230e8a67e804b72</a> <strong>(Fee: 0.00001831 PART)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-fxMVOo_ApxLtXbDogpDLPQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Transaction Fee: Fee: 0.00000963 PART</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-lightning-network\">What’s the Lightning Network?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-jG2LXZO6B7tHk23aKP14tg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>https://blockstream.com/lightning/</figcaption></figure><p>The Lightning Network (LND) is a payment protocol that runs parallel to a blockchain.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
