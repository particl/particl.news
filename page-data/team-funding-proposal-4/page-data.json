Since then, we've made substantial\nstrides across all aspects of the Particl ecosystem, particularly in regards to\nBasicSwap DEX, our latest privacy-first and pro-liberty dApp.\n\nHere's a snapshot of our accomplishments and noteworthy news since the\ninitiation of the third funding cycle.\n\n * Publication of Particl’s whitepaper (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/])\n * Launch of BasicSwap’s open beta (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/])\n * Multiple subsequent BasicSwap GUI updates (1\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-available/], 2\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-0-1-available/], 3\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/])\n * Deployment of rudimentary BSX liquidity and market making tool (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/])\n * Particl Desktop 3.3 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-mainnet/] and \n   3.3.1 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-1-now-available/]\n * 9 Particl Core releases (1 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]\n   , 2 [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Core 25.x latest version (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-core-25rc1-released/])\n * Attended and gave presentations at Monerotopia\n   [https://staging.particl.news/basicswap-monerotopia-presentation/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-goes-to-monerotopia/] and Monerokon\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-talk-at-monerokon/]\n * New BasicSwap.com [https://basicswap.com] website and upcoming Particl.io\n   [https://particl.io] revamp\n * Breakthrough bidirectional Monero atomic swaps (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n   )\n * PART added to the mobile Stack Wallet (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/])\n * Particl blockchain’s yearly coin emission rate reduced (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/part-coin-emission-rate-reduced/])\n\nItems in Progress and Current Main Priorities\nIn addition to the aforementioned completed milestones, we’re currently actively\nworking on a couple of major items that align with Particl's ultimate vision.\nOur objective is to complete or make major progress on these during the\nforthcoming funding cycle while simultaneously working on various smaller\ndeliverables.\n\n * Getting PART listed on better exchanges to ease access into the ecosystem and\n   improve general market health\n * Web framework and integration layer for BasicSwap DEX and Particl Marketplace\n * Seller app (Particl Marketplace)\n * Messaging layer agnosticism for BasicSwap DEX\n * New coin integrations into BasicSwap\n * SMSG 2.0 (still in research phase, not in active development)\n\n> Note: Just like any roadmap or medium-term planning, modifications to our plans\nmay occur due to a variety of factors, such as, among others, emerging\nopportunities and changes in funding scenarios or team composition adjustments.\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 12 months\n\nThis funding request proposes a monthly claim of 35,250 PART from the Treasury\nFund for a 12-month period to support the Particl team and fund its operations.\nFollowing the end of this period, the proposal will need to be renewed and\nreceive the approval of Particl stakeholders once again to claim further funds.\n\nAs with the previous proposal, the team has chosen to claim funds for an entire\nyear to ensure steady support for current endeavors and ease the logistics\nassociated with potential external funding possibilities and hiring processes.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to enhance the\necosystem and its dApps. An example of such endeavour was Particl's recent\nparticipation at both Monerotopia and Monerokon a few months ago.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nRegarding External Funding\nThe Particl team is exploring several external funding options and is\ncontinuously assessing various proposals we receive related to third-party\nmarket liquidity or capital injections. This aims to supplement the funds drawn\nfrom the network's treasury by either providing non-PART funds to the team or\nbuilding a healthier PART landscape and a more liquid market environment for\neveryone.\n\nWhile we remain flexible and open to innovative solutions in this aspect, we are\nacutely aware of any potential impacts such initiatives could have on the\nproject, market, and community. Thus, we're taking a cautious and deliberate\napproach, and cannot provide any guarantees regarding the outcomes of these\ninitiatives if none ultimately prove beneficial to the project and its\ncommunity.\n\n> Note: This proposal has been created under the assumption that no external funds\nwill be raised, and it is sufficient to cover the team’s fundamental ongoing\nexpenses\nHow to Vote\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running the latest version of\nPartyman.

Our objective is to complete or make major progress on these during the forthcoming funding cycle while simultaneously working on various smaller deliverables.</p><ul><li><strong>Getting PART listed on better exchanges</strong> to ease access into the ecosystem and improve general market health</li><li><strong>Web framework</strong> and integration layer for BasicSwap DEX and Particl Marketplace</li><li><strong>Seller app</strong> (Particl Marketplace)</li><li>Messaging layer <strong>agnosticism</strong> for BasicSwap DEX</li><li><strong>New coin integrations </strong>into BasicSwap</li><li><strong>SMSG 2.0</strong> (still in research phase, not in active development)</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>Just like any roadmap or medium-term planning, modifications to our plans may occur due to a variety of factors, such as, among others, emerging opportunities and changes in funding scenarios or team composition adjustments.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-funding-request-in-detail\">The Funding Request in Detail</h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months</li></ul><p>This funding request proposes a <strong>monthly claim of 35,250 PART</strong> from the Treasury Fund for a <strong>12-month period </strong>to support the Particl team and fund its operations. Following the end of this period, the proposal will need to be renewed and receive the approval of Particl stakeholders once again to claim further funds.</p><p>As with the previous proposal, the team has chosen to claim funds for an entire year to ensure steady support for current endeavors and ease the logistics associated with potential external funding possibilities and hiring processes.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\">Funding Distribution Breakdown</h3><p>Given the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily allocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as cover various operational expenses.</p><p>Should the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be accumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of marketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to enhance the ecosystem and its dApps. An example of such endeavour was Particl's recent participation at both Monerotopia and Monerokon a few months ago.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"regarding-external-funding\">Regarding External Funding</h3><p>The Particl team is exploring several external funding options and is continuously assessing various proposals we receive related to third-party market liquidity or capital injections. This aims to supplement the funds drawn from the network's treasury by either providing non-PART funds to the team or building a healthier PART landscape and a more liquid market environment for everyone.</p><p>While we remain flexible and open to innovative solutions in this aspect, we are acutely aware of any potential impacts such initiatives could have on the project, market, and community. Thus, we're taking a cautious and deliberate approach, and cannot provide any guarantees regarding the outcomes of these initiatives if none ultimately prove beneficial to the project and its community.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>This proposal has been created under the assumption that no external funds will be raised, and it is sufficient to cover the team’s fundamental ongoing expenses</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"how-to-vote\">How to Vote</h2><p>To cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold staking application and register your vote on the blockchain for <code class=\"language-text\">proposal #19</code>. </p><p>You have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).

in May 2023, we traveled to Mexico City as the BasicSwap team to attend\nMonerotopia 2023. For this edition of the Monero-centric conference, they've\ndecided to welcome various privacy-focused cryptocurrency and blockchain\nprojects. There, we not only hosted a booth and forged valuable connections, but\nalso presented, on the event's main stage, BasicSwap DEX, its mission, story,\nand role within the broader privacy subset of the cryptocurrency economy.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce that the presentation is now officially\navailable on MoneroTalk's Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/@MoneroTalk/videos], and that you can finally watch it\nfrom home!\n\nTry BasicSwap DEX Today\nBasicSwap DEX's open beta is live and you can use it today! All you need to do\nis follow the instructions either on its section of the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html]\n, or from the Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEZ-a00uSM&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfxAswJnqlh_KbHvWCUFqFVF]\n.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's Order BookWhat Happened Since This Presentation\nSince this presentation, we've been hard at work improving BasicSwap's core tech\nand elevating its user experience. \n\nFirstly, we've introduced a basic liquidity providing / market making tool\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/] that anyone can deploy and\noperate from home. While it falls short of any advanced feature, such as what\nwould be possible via something like a Hummingbot integration, it enables more\nautomated and logic-based management of your liquidity and offers. Of course, we\nplan on much more all-emcompassing solutions moving forward; this is merely the\nfirst initial step towards more comprehensive solutions in the future.\n\nWe've also pursued our work on implementing a series of user interface\nimprovements [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/],\nsimplifying and refining the end-user experience. These updates have also\nsignificantly streamlined the code, enhancing the app's efficiency.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most notably since the Monerotopia presentation, we've\nadded the long-awaited bidirectional atomic swap functionality for Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. As explained in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, Monero atomic swaps, despite their groundbreaking nature, were previously\nlimited by a significant technical constraint: offers could only request Monero,\nnot offer it for other cryptocurrencies, leading to a 'one-way swapping only'\nscenario.\n\nOur latest update addresses this limitation, enabling 'two-way' Monero swapping \nor, in other words, allowing you to offer Monero when creating swap offers on\nBasicSwap's order book. While this clever workaround, made possible by the SMSG\nnetwork, doesn't resolve the technical limitation at the protocol level, it does\nso at the end-user level, making the user experience seamless with no additional\nsteps, fees, or encumbrances.\n\nThis development positions atomic swap-based Monero DEXs like BasicSwap as a\nviable alternative to data-hungry and oftentimes straight up irresponsible\ncentralized exchanges. It significantly enhances the resilience of Monero and\nPART (Anon) to external attacks and censorship campaigns.\n\nWhat's Next for BasicSwap DEX? \nWith the successful launch of the major bidirectional Monero atomic swap update,\nour attention, in regards to BasicSwap, is now concentrated on three key areas.\n\nFirstly, we are actively exploring the addition of more cryptocurrencies to the\nplatform. Though we've had to postpone this expansion to prioritize core aspects\nof the DEX, the demand for new additions has remained strong, with many requests\noriginating directly from representatives of projects seeking to be included on\nour platform. Therefore, we are now assessing the integration feasibility of\nseveral coins and hope to add a few of them in the coming weeks, alongside our\nongoing work on other areas.\n\nSecondly, we are in the process of developing a web framework that will enable\nBasicSwap-powered web services to be easily accessed through a web browser. For\nexample, envision web-based exchanges akin to Changelly or ChangeNow, but driven\nby a completely decentralized exchange protocol (BasicSwap). This significant\nadvancement is crucial in making BasicSwap DEX accessible to the wider crypto\ncommunity, including those with less technical expertise. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of this web framework will allow integrations with various\napplications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr.\nKap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl\nMarketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during\ncheckout, while still settling the transaction in PART. This is but one example\nof what can be possible with a web framework built for integrations.\n\nLastly, we are committed to enhancing BasicSwap's scalability. We are\nconsidering two potential solutions for this. The first involves creating what\nwe have temporarily named \"SMSG 2.0\". Although referred to as 2.0, this\ninitiative actually requires constructing a new SMSG-like mixnet from the ground\nup, designed for near-infinite scalability. Though we have a design and some\ninitial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand\nsignificant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative\nmixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of\nincorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap. Depending on the daily\nusage of BasicSwap, a balancing system could distribute the messaging load\nacross all integrated mixnets, thus ensuring the DEX's scalability for early but\nsubstantial adoption.\n\nAnd while we believe strongly in the scalability potential of SMSG 2.0, the\nsystem balancing messaging load across multiple mixnets might remain even after\nits readiness, if it proves effective, as it may further bolster the resiliency\nand decentralization of the DEX.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOf course, the elements we are currently focusing on, including the integration\nof more complex cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap, are substantial and will\nrequire time to fully develop. However, these efforts are paramount to realizing\nour vision of a seamlessly interconnected, privacy-first, and pro-liberty\ndigital economy. Equally important is making this economy as accessible as\npossible, to ensure that it can be embraced by a wide audience.\n\nOnce implemented, these three significant advancements will position BasicSwap\nDEX to challenge traditional centralized exchanges and catalyze the broader\nadoption of a crypto economy that's truly independent of the legacy \"fiat\nsystem\".\n\nIn the interim, we invite you to support BasicSwap by testing its capabilities,\nsharing feedback and comments with us, and adding liquidity to the order book.\nEvery contribution, regardless of its size, plays a vital role in building the\nbrighter future we all strive to achieve.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

As explained in <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>, Monero atomic swaps, despite their groundbreaking nature, were previously limited by a significant technical constraint: offers could only request Monero, not offer it for other cryptocurrencies, leading to a 'one-way swapping only' scenario.</p><p><strong>Our latest update addresses this limitation, enabling 'two-way' Monero swapping </strong>or, in other words, allowing you to offer Monero when creating swap offers on BasicSwap's order book. While this clever workaround, made possible by the SMSG network, doesn't resolve the technical limitation at the protocol level, it does so at the end-user level, making the user experience seamless with no additional steps, fees, or encumbrances.</p><p>This development positions atomic swap-based Monero DEXs like BasicSwap as a viable alternative to data-hungry and oftentimes straight up irresponsible centralized exchanges. It significantly enhances the resilience of Monero and PART (Anon) to external attacks and censorship campaigns.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-for-basicswap-dex\">What's Next for BasicSwap DEX? </h2><p>With the successful launch of the major bidirectional Monero atomic swap update, our attention, in regards to BasicSwap, is now concentrated on three key areas.</p><p>Firstly, we are actively exploring the <strong>addition of more cryptocurrencies to the platform</strong>. Though we've had to postpone this expansion to prioritize core aspects of the DEX, the demand for new additions has remained strong, with many requests originating directly from representatives of projects seeking to be included on our platform. Therefore, we are now assessing the integration feasibility of several coins and hope to add a few of them in the coming weeks, alongside our ongoing work on other areas.</p><p>Secondly, we are in the process of developing a <strong>web framework</strong> that will enable BasicSwap-powered web services to be easily accessed through a web browser. For example, envision web-based exchanges akin to Changelly or ChangeNow, but driven by a completely decentralized exchange protocol (BasicSwap). This significant advancement is crucial in making BasicSwap DEX accessible to the wider crypto community, including those with less technical expertise. Moreover, the development of this web framework will allow integrations with various applications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr. Kap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl Marketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during checkout, while still settling the transaction in PART. This is but one example of what can be possible with a web framework built for integrations.</p><p>Lastly, we are committed to <strong>enhancing BasicSwap's scalability</strong>. We are considering two potential solutions for this. The first involves creating what we have temporarily named \"<strong>SMSG 2.0</strong>\". Although referred to as 2.0, this initiative actually requires constructing a new SMSG-like mixnet from the ground up, designed for near-infinite scalability. Though we have a design and some initial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand significant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative mixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of incorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap. Depending on the daily usage of BasicSwap, a balancing system could distribute the messaging load across all integrated mixnets, thus ensuring the DEX's scalability for early but substantial adoption.</p><p>And while we believe strongly in the scalability potential of SMSG 2.0, the system balancing messaging load across multiple mixnets might remain even after its readiness, if it proves effective, as it may further bolster the resiliency and decentralization of the DEX.</p><hr><p>Of course, the elements we are currently focusing on, including the integration of more complex cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap, are substantial and will require time to fully develop. However, these efforts are paramount to realizing our vision of a <strong>seamlessly interconnected, privacy-first, and pro-liberty digital economy</strong>. Equally important is making this economy as accessible as possible, to ensure that it can be embraced by a wide audience.</p><p>Once implemented, these three significant advancements will position BasicSwap DEX to challenge traditional centralized exchanges and catalyze the broader adoption of a crypto economy that's truly independent of the legacy \"fiat system\".</p><p>In the interim, we invite you to support BasicSwap by testing its capabilities, sharing feedback and comments with us, and adding liquidity to the order book. Every contribution, regardless of its size, plays a vital role in building the brighter future we all strive to achieve.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
