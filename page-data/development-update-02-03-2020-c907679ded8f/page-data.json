Introducing \nInfinite Markets, Market Management, and a slew of new features and improvements\n, this release is going to bring to the table better, faster, and stronger \ncodebases for both the marketplace and the desktop client.\n\n> With more than 100,000 new lines of code and 80% of the code being completely\nre-written, this massive update will also introduce a wide array of new features \nas well as significant improvements to the user interface (UI), user experience\n(UX), making it to the best Particl application ever.\nAmong all the things Particl Desktop 2.4.0 will introduce, the most noteworthy\nare as follow:\n\n * Listing fees reduced by 80% or more\n * Infinite Markets & Market Management\n * Identity Management and seller profiles\n * Significant performance boost\n * More lightweight Particl Desktop client\n * The marketplace can easily be activated on the initial setup\n * Various user-interface and user-experience improvements\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnderstanding the Significance of this New Release\nParticl Desktop 2.4.0 is far from being “just another Particl Desktop update”.\nIn fact, this new update not only applies critical updates to the marketplace\ncodebase, but it also completely changes the codebase of the desktop client\napplication. In other words, over the last few months, Particl Desktop has gone\nthrough a full rewrite of its code (more than 80% of the code is getting\ncompletely overhauled), a necessary change that is going to allow future updates\nto be integrated much faster and much more easily.\n\nWhy a Full Rewrite?\nThere is a very important fact about the current Particl Desktop\napplication — it uses the same codebase as it did when it first released in\n2017. Since its release, new features, including the marketplace itself, have\nevolved massively and the need for a more rock-solid foundation became apparent\nto be prepared for the next innovations and evolution of the Particl Desktop\napplication. And Particl Desktop did its job well, as a cryptocurrency wallet,\nbut over time, the client accumulated what can be referenced to as a “technical\ndebt” as the new features introduced lots of new requirements.\n\n> Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied\ncost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of\nusing a better approach that would take longer. As with monetary debt, if\ntechnical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate ‘interest’, making it harder to\nimplement changes. —Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt]\nAdditionally, the development team also planned out, since Particl Desktop’s\nfirst mainnet release, a lot of ways that the code could be improved and made\nbetter, faster, and stronger. That’s a direct result of working day in and day\nout on the same application for years and getting very familiar with the various\nprocesses that make it up. With the upcoming major changes required on both\nParticl Desktop and the marketplace codebase by the Infinite Markets and Market\nManagement, it only made sense that the time was ripe to pay off that technical\ndebt.\n\nIt helps keep the code clean and makes it tremendously easier to add new, more\ncomplex features, without having to risk to break other things while doing it or\nspend an absurd amount of time trying to “patch it in”. This full re-write of\nthe Desktop application will not only be a benefit to the developers, but will\nalso make the application much smoother to use and will feel much faster and\npolished. While the general UI will still look somewhat similar, the code\nholding it together will be dramatically improved.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Latest Progress on the Upcoming Release?\nThe biggest and most time-consuming part of the development process of bringing\nthe new release on mainnet has been completed. On one end, the back-end code for\nthe marketplace codebase is currently being tested with all sorts of automated\nand integration tests, and on the other end, the new codebase for Particl\nDesktop has seen its foundations being completed. What remains to be done is\nmostly the implementation of the newly updated codebase into the new Particl\nDesktop, which is expected to take more or less a month of coding time.\n\nAs it currently stands, the public testnet release is currently estimated to be\nready within a few weeks, sometime around mid-April.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith this new testnet build approaching, now’s the time to let people around you\nknow about it and raise awareness! This update will significantly improve the\noverall user experience of the marketplace and introduce one of the\nlongest-awaited Particl feature ever. It will enable anyone to create private or\npublic markets and storefronts, with a fine tuning of the identity, which means\nmany times more use cases than today for Particl.\n\nDo you know online sellers that accept crypto or would benefit highly from a\nmore private, censorship-proof eCommerce solution?

What this means is that you can\nnow store, send, receive, and swap PART for any of the other available assets\nwithin Flare Wallet’s ecosystem. Flare Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, meaning\nthat their team doesn’t have access to your private keys at all, and is\navailable on both mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nFlare Wallet | Privacy Focused Cryptocurrency Wallet [https://flarewallet.io/]\nSecure privacy focused cryptocurrency wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin\nand\nmany more.flarewallet.io [https://flarewallet.io/]\n\nTeamwork Within Privacy & Security Focused Projects\nThe addition of PART into Flare Wallet is an encouraging story amidst an\nindustry that has unfortunately turned increasingly “pay-to-play”. When one\nstand up Particl community member (thanks to CaptainSkywalker) reached out to\nthe Flare Wallet team, their team took the time to dive into Particl to see what\nit was all about. They then reached out to the Particl team with an interest in\nlisting the coin solely based on the nature (especially its focus on privacy and\nsecurity), vision, and constant development of the project.\n\nThe Flare Wallet team never asked for a listing fee or a portion of the supply.\nThey instead reached out simply to ask whether the Particl team would be okay\nwith getting PART added to their ecosystem and inquired about a few technical\nquestions.\n\nFor this reason, Cryptoguard opened up a donation bounty for any Particl\ncommunity member to show their appreciation to Flare Wallet’s approach to\nworking with other privacy and security projects, as opposed to straight up\nasking for a listing fee payment regardless of the nature of the project. At the\ntime of this writing, the donation address has accumulated a total of ~2,745\nPART and will be transferred, today, to the Flare Wallet team.\n\nThis also highlights how effective a community can be. The Particl team is\nalways open to help out and support any community member with their initiatives!\nIt highly encourages any community member to do whatever it can in spreading the\nword and helping the ecosystem reach more people across the world. We’re all in\nthis together as a big family! ?\n\nFlare Wallet — One Solution for Atomic Swaps on Particl’s Marketplace?\nWhile Flare Wallet’s swap services currently work by leveraging third-party\npartners’ services (i.e. StealthEx), their team is actively working towards\nimplementing atomic swaps into their engine so that swaps conducted on their\nwallet would be entirely trustless (as in, no middleman required to execute a\nswap). This was a development both the Flare Wallet and Particl teams found very\ninteresting as it relates to Particl’s marketplace.\n\nAs it currently stands, Particl’s marketplace only accepts BTC (and of course,\nPART) through SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io], but it is entirely possible to\nadd more coins using many different swap services. That means that, once Flare\nWallet successfully pushes atomic swap style swaps in production, it could\neasily be integrated into Particl’s marketplace and Particl Desktop client.\n\nOf course, Particl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert, has been\nworking on his own implementation of atomic swaps, but as you already know,\nParticl has an agnostic approach to such services on its platform. An additional\natomic swap solution is very much appreciated as it would increase\ndecentralization ever more (in that case, by adding more options, thus making\nthe overall platform more resilient) and by bringing more volume and liquidity\nthrough Flare Wallet’s reach within their own community as well as the greater\ncryptocurrency community. After all, Flare Wallet is a relatively well-known\nwallet within the industry and has a good level of brand recognition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore About Flare Wallet\nFlare is a multi-asset privacy focused cryptocurrency light wallet. All keys are\nmanaged locally and completely secured and encrypted by the end-user with a\nsimple 12 seed mnemonic phrase backup. There are no servers that manage your\nwallets for you — you control everything. We believe it is important to create a\nwallet interface that is both fashionable and simple to use while giving it as\nmuch power as possible. Being a multi-currency privacy focused wallet, it will\nalso include and focus on several privacy/security features:\n\n * Networking privacy: Flare will have the option of being routed through Tor\n   networking to give users the best possible network privacy when\n   sending/receiving/swapping.\n * Coin-Control support (after beta): Flare will give users the ability to\n   control their inputs for each transaction for coins that utilize UTXO sets.\n   Benefits of this will be outlined below.\n * Decentralized privacy swaps (after beta): Flare will allow users to swap\n   their coins within the wallet using decentralized methods while using the \n   NIX\n   protocol [https://nixplatform.io]to break the linkage between swaps.\n * Hardware wallet support (after beta): Being able to use your Ledger/Trezor\n   for supported coins within the wallet to ensure the highest possible asset\n   security.\n\nFor users who value their privacy, Flare will give the best support possible in\nany multi-currency wallet available. For users who are just looking for a secure\nwallet that supports/will support many popular coins for them to store their\nholdings, Flare will do just the job.

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it, running servers, or having any sort of special\ncontrol over its network. Instead, it uses a mix of P2P and blockchain\ntechnologies, meaning that it is exclusively run by its global community of\nusers that are running nodes. It is, in most ways, pretty similar to how P2P\ntorrent networks operate and is the reason why they can’t be censored.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to securely buy and sell\ngoods and services, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in\nthe world. The marketplace requires no sign-up, no personal information, no\nsubscription, and is free of use. And because it is entirely decentralized,\nthere’s no staff or support team to manage disputes between a buyer and a\nseller. But that doesn’t mean there is no system to keep both parties honest in\nplace.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange and\ncommunications are encrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through\nthe Tor network. In other words, users of the marketplace are as anonymous as\nthe current privacy technologies of today allow you to be.\n\nTrusting the Other Party\nHowever, the combination of all the marketplace’s characteristics mentioned\nabove introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to trusting the other party\n(whether that be the buyer or the seller) when making a transaction on the\nmarketplace.\n\nOn traditional, centralized marketplaces, this isn’t the biggest of deals, at\nleast from the customer point of view. In fact, these platforms either have a\n“resolution center” in place or an escrow system where users can be assured that\nthe other party will behave honestly. And it works…in most cases\n[https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/top-ebay-scams-14781610].\n\nParticl, however, is entirely decentralized and private. That means there’s no\nstaff around to arbitrate issues and make sure all transacting parties are\nhonest between each other.\n\nSo then, how can you prevent the other party from not respecting their end of\nthe deal when their identity is private and when there is no central party that\ncan punish bad actors? Does the buyer send the payment first, and then hope his\nproduct arrives in a good shape, if at all? Or does the seller take the risk to\nship the item before receiving the payment? This all boils down to trust, and\ntrusting strangers on the web, especially when they use bleeding-edge privacy\ntechnologies\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd], has\nalways proven to be risky and, frankly, ill-advised.\n\nThat’s where Particl’s innovative dual deposit MAD escrow system comes into\nplay.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDual Deposit MAD Escrow System\nLike most marketplaces, Particl uses an escrow system to keep transacting\nparties honest. The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the\nsystem used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s \ncompletely trustless, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary\nto have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also \nfree of use, private-by-default, and fully autonomous between the buyer and the\nseller.\n\nAn escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one,\nit dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all\ntransaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and\nany other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two\ntransacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside\nparty looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no\nservices being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the\nescrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction\nand makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep\nhiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’\nschedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e.\nOpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).\n\nSo how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one\nanother without any third-party enforcing honesty?\n\nDual Deposits\nIn order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving\ndishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place.\nTypically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the\nmoderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and\nscrew one of the parties unfairly (hint: eCommerce platforms will almost always\nrule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller\n[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay]).\n\nOn Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms\nof dual deposits and game-theory.\n\nThe way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty\neffective. In a nutshell, when making a marketplace transaction, both parties\n(the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow\nsmart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the\nshipping costs. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in\nthe game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been\ncompleted satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party,\nat no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.\n\nTo visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth\n$100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110\nwhich is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and\nanother $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full\nand without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other\nhand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be\nfunding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be\nshipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means\nboth parties now have $220 on the line.\n\nWhile the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to\npackage and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s\ngoing to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the\ntransaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the\ntransaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both\nparties.\n\nMutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory\nThe reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves\nor tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the\ntransaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security\ndeposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security\ndeposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be\nsatisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the\nagreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.\n\nThis dynamic is often referred to as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction]. It is a well-known\nwar doctrine\n[https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/] \nbased on game-theory. The theory stipulates that if two countries are in\npossession of nuclear weapons, they won’t use them against each other. The\nreason for that is pretty simple — if one country launches a nuke towards the\nother party, it is almost guaranteed that the other country will retaliate and\nlaunch a nuke as well. The end scenario is that both countries will essentially\nannihilate each other with highly damaging weapons. In other words, both\ncountries lose and get turned into dust, hence why this game-theory is called \nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nThe effectiveness of that game-theory was on full display, in a real-world\nscenario, during the Cold War when both the US and Russia heavily threatened\neach other with nuclear warheads. Missiles were very visibly targeted at each\nrival country, but never was a nuclear attack initiated due to the fear of\nretaliation from the other country.\n\nHow Does That Theory Tie In With Particl’s Escrow System?\nParticl’s escrow is more of the same, only the game-theory doesn’t revolve\naround the use of nukes, but around financial losses. The important point to\nunderstand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that\nif one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence\nthe “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl,\nthat negative incentive is a net financial loss.\n\nIn fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive\ntheir security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s\nprecisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work\ntowards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of\nintermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds,\nand no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can\nsuccessfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for\nthe usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or\nbusiness-related data to any outside party or intermediary.\n\nThis model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no\noutside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between\nthe two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply\nchains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved\nwants a third-party to snoop in. There’s no account details being revealed to an\nescrow agent, no transaction history being looked at, no tracking number or\nshipping address being looked at, no conversation being logged, and so on.\nEqually as important, there’s also nothing traceable or identifiable being\npublicly written on the blockchain.\n\nPrivacy\nProbably the most powerful feature of this entire escrow mechanism is the fact\nthat all currency transactions are initiated using the powerful RingCT privacy\nprotocol. The escrow smart-contract itself works using the Confidential\nTransactions (CT) privacy protocol, but any incoming and outgoing transactions\nto it are done with RingCT. Check out this Particl Explained — Private\nTransactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef] \narticle for more details about how CT and RingCT transactions can be linked\ntogether.\n\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\n\nAnd because all transactions that occur on the marketplace have to go through\nthe escrow system, it means they’re all untraceable by design.\n\nThis ensures all marketplace transactions are fungible and as private as the\nnext one. It’s also a great way to grow the pool of private transactions (the\nnumber of RingCT outputs) that occur on the network, something that greatly\nenhances the quality of the privacy of the whole platform.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterested in learning more about Particl, its platform, and its marketplace?\nMake sure to keep an eye close to Particl.news [http://Particl.news] for regular\nnews, updates, and similar educational material.

The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the system used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s <strong>completely trustless</strong>, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary to have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also <strong>free of use</strong>,<strong> private-by-default</strong>, and <strong>fully autonomous</strong> between the buyer and the seller.</p><p>An escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one, it dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all transaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and any other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two transacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside party looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no services being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the escrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction and makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep hiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’ schedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e. OpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).</p><p>So how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one another without any third-party enforcing honesty?</p><h3 id=\"dual-deposits\">Dual Deposits</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-83zap8l7onknenEufi6rAg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving dishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place. Typically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the moderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and screw one of the parties unfairly (hint: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay\"><strong>eCommerce platforms will almost always rule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller</strong></a>).</p><p>On Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms of <strong>dual deposits</strong> and <strong>game-theory</strong>.</p><p>The way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty effective. In a nutshell, <strong>when making a marketplace transaction, both parties (the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow smart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the shipping costs</strong>. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in the game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been completed satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party, at no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.</p><p>To visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth $100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110 which is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and another $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full and without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other hand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be funding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be shipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means both parties now have $220 on the line.</p><p>While the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to package and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s going to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the transaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the transaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both parties.</p><h3 id=\"mutually-assured-destruction-mad-game-theory\">Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves or tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the transaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security deposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security deposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be satisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the agreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.</p><p>This dynamic is often referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\"><em><strong>Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</strong></em></a>. It is a <a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/\">well-known war doctrine</a> based on game-theory. The theory stipulates that if two countries are in possession of nuclear weapons, they won’t use them against each other. The reason for that is pretty simple — if one country launches a nuke towards the other party, it is almost guaranteed that the other country will retaliate and launch a nuke as well. The end scenario is that both countries will essentially annihilate each other with highly damaging weapons. In other words, both countries lose and get turned into dust, hence why this game-theory is called <em>Mutually Assured Destruction</em>.</p><p>The effectiveness of that game-theory was on full display, in a real-world scenario, during the Cold War when both the US and Russia heavily threatened each other with nuclear warheads. Missiles were very visibly targeted at each rival country, but never was a nuclear attack initiated due to the fear of retaliation from the other country.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-that-theory-tie-in-with-particl-s-escrow-system\">How Does That Theory Tie In With Particl’s Escrow System?</h3><p>Particl’s escrow is more of the same, only the game-theory doesn’t revolve around the use of nukes, but around financial losses. The important point to understand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that if one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence the “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl, that negative incentive is a net financial loss.</p><p>In fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive their security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s precisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work towards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of intermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds, and no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can successfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or business-related data to any outside party or intermediary.</p><p>This model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no outside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between the two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply chains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved wants a third-party to snoop in.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption.

Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
