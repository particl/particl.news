BasicSwap leverages this in several different ways.\n\nSwaps occur directly on the blockchain, utilizing adaptor signatures and\nsemi-scriptless scripts, while Particl's encrypted messaging system anonymously\nmanages the trustless order book and automates the swapping process between\ninvolved parties. This allows BasicSwap to coordinate swaps and disseminate\norders throughout the open source network, while sacrificing none of its\nprivacy-first concerns and network resilience. \n\nThis combination effectively positions BasicSwap as the most affordable, secure,\nand anonymous exchange solution currently available in the cryptocurrency\nlandscape. \n\nAn instance of the BasicSwap application, showing some of the decentralized\norder bookBitcoin Cash Integration: Expanding Options for Users\nThe BasicSwap open source community seeks support from the Bitcoin Cash\ncommunity in order to integrate their coin into the ecosystem.

A bit earlier today, on this 1st of February, 2022, the\nParticl blockchain has successfully hardforked and activated Taproot!\n\nThe hardfork also includes other items such as a fix to the dynamic marketplace\nlisting fees, the addition of dynamic supply (the blockchain adjusts its\ncirculating supply whenever PART gets burned), and an improvement to the SMSG\nnetwork which allows for more messages to be funded from a single transaction.\n\nTo see the first post-hardfork block (#1,113,123) , check out this link\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/3c32fe749dbd6d1f50254d966dc2248d621ffc603beee8b52481a6bcb63082db]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings the ability for Particl applications (i.e., Particl\nMarketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) to gain more privacy\nand cost smaller transaction fees.\n\nTaproot—More Privacy, Less Fees\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. It improves the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction,\nmaking the P2P network more efficient.\n\nFixing Dynamic Marketplace Listing Fees\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower.\n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability had been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, at some point in the past, the fee\ntarget amount dropped below a particular threshold and the code didn't allow it\nto change anymore (up or down). This hardfork fixed that issue by clamping the\nminimum amount it can change to 1 sat, making the feature functional and\nallowing stakers to adjust listing fees again. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] to learn how you can\nhelp reduce the marketplace listing fees.\n\nAdding Dynamic Supply\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThe hardfork also re-enabled a small number of disabled outputs from people who\nhad missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and haven’t\nput up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the steps\nmentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/]. If\napproved, it will be added to the whitelist and will be re-enabled on the next\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.
