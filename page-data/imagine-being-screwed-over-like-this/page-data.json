While they\naggressively charge you for every sale you make, they also get to see all of\nyour sales data; valuable information to have if you want to launch products.\nEven better if you plan on launching copycats! In more than one way, just by\nselling on their platform, they get you to pay them…to do their market research.\nInsulting, isn’t it?\n\nSee, the problematic issue here is that Amazon doesn't expose itself to any risk\nwhen launching a new product, nor do they go through the time and effort of\nresearching consumer needs and likes; that’s your burden to carry if you want to\nsucceed, and their success to steal if you do! Instead, Amazon simply accesses\n'your' sales data that you generate when using their platform and use some AI to\ninstantly know what products are selling best or will sell best in the future.\nThen, all that’s left for them to do is to hand the identified product (aka your\nproduct) over to a third-party manufacturer who will create a copycat out of it,\nwith a few minor modifications so that they can avoid almost any patent. The end\nresult? An AmazonBasics product (or one that is sold under any of their\nsub-brands\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-owns-these-brands-list-2018-7]) that’s\nmuch cheaper than the original, both in price…and quality.\n\nIt’s a cynically cost-effective strategy for an organization that has a\nnear-infinite budget and customer reach. And it’s much more so when they control\nwhat is likely to be the world’s most popular online marketplace. \n\nThey copied you, but you’re still making more sales than they’d like? No\nproblem, they’ll just move you to page 10! And while that may sound like a\nshort-term win for consumers because it gets them cheaper products, it is really\na net loss for all when nobody wants to innovate and come up with new products\nanymore out of fear of being screwed over.\n\nThink of it. Imagine being the inventor of a copied product, who invested the\nintellectual and financial capital into its development, put in blood, sweat,\nand tears to get it to production, only to be screwed over right at the moment\nthat he starts getting a tiny bit of success with his product. And Amazon, who\nwere making a handsome (exorbitant) commission selling the original product in\nthe first place, go on to brazenly become your direct competitor using an\nobvious copycat. Of course, to make things even worse, Amazon gets to sell their\nproduct without paying the exorbitant sales fees any other vendor would be\nforced to pay. And so, the consumer loses, the small and local businesses as\nwell, the product inventors too, but Amazon gets to rake in billions of dollars.\nSounds fair and ethical…not!\n\nPrivacy in eCommerce — Protect Your BusinessHow Privacy Can Help You Keep Your\nBusiness AliveParticl Newsdros\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/]\nOpportunistic Behaviour, aka 'Screwing Partners Over'\nLet's look at things from a different perspective.\n\nImagine you start a company that produces something that is 'better than sliced\nbread'. You’ve made it; your business has become successful, and Amazon's\nventure capital arm reaches out to you. Sounds exciting, right? Well, slow down\na little and let's take a look at a couple of examples that might make you\nreconsider whether you would even want to talk to them.\n\nA while ago, Amazon’s fund invested in Defined Crowd [https://www.defined.ai/].\nAs part of that investment, Amazon got access to the finances as well as the\ntechnology of Defined Crowd. Four years later, Daniela Braga, the founder and\nCEO of the company, accused Amazon of stealing their concept\n[https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2020/report-companies-say-amazon-accessed-proprietary-info-to-make-its-own-products/] \nand launching it as A21, a service of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is in\ndirect competition with them. Dealing with Amazon can turn a supposedly helpful\ncapital boost into your worst nightmare.\n\nUbi, who build smart speakers, met Amazon to discuss funding for their product\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-ubi-smart-speaker-2020-7]. Amazon\nwent through their entire pitch, the tech behind it, and shortly afterwards,\nlaunched Echo. Yes, the same Echo that powers Alexa. It was a concept imagined\nby someone who had a billion-dollar idea, but it more than likely ended up being\nstolen and developed by a company too big to drag through court.\n\nIndeed, Amazon has so many more reports of unethical behaviours and unfair,\nanti-competitive practices. Want to hear more about it? Just take this example\nfrom India where Amazon was caught red-handing manipulating search results to\nbenefit their own products and competing ones (and in many cases, original\nproducts that Amazon simply copied, as we mentioned above).\n\nAmazon copied products and rigged search results, documents showA trove of\nAmazon documents reveals how the company ran a campaign in India of creating\nknockoff goods and manipulating search results to boost its own\nproducts.Reuters\nADITYA KALRA in New Delhi and STEVE STECKLOW in London\n[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/]In\nthe end, in all of those cases, someone or a business got AMAZONED!\n\nThankfully, Amazon is gradually being made more accountable and is having to \nanswer to the US House Judiciary Committee\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/house-committee-threatens-amazon-with-criminal-investigation-into-market-dominance] \nfor its immoral and unethical behaviours, but who knows what positive changes\nthat will bring, if any.

So imagine trading directly with other people, without paying any\nfee, and without any restriction or shady practices we too often see. The future\nis here!\n\nDeCommerce is indeed the next logical step towards a world that is freer and a\nfairer. Towards a world where our right to privacy still exists.

So see you all on Monday! Oh, right, it's time for our\nweekly development update first! ?\n\nThis week, most of the focus has been on adding a few key improvements to the\nmarketplace and desktop client after receiving various feedback from the\ncommunity. While these fixes may seem mundane to some, they fix relatively\nencumbering issues that affect both buyers and sellers in different cases. A few\nexamples of these improvements will be given in the Particl Desktop progress\nreport section of this blog post.\n\nAdditionally, we mentioned last week that, due to the larger-than-expected scope\nof adding digital items delivery, we were evaluating whether we'd include that\nfeature in Particl Desktop 3.1 or not. After looking at the situation, we've\nopted not to include it. \n\nA big reason for this decision is that Particl Desktop 3.1 now includes a lot of\nimportant and quality-of-life fixes and improvements over the initial mainnet\nrelease of Particl V3. Delaying their release would be counter-productive and\nunnecessary. Indeed, some of these fixes are relatively critical for some users,\nand so we're prioritizing releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 faster so that these\nusers can benefit from the fixes and gain back a better user experience.\n\nWith that in mind, we've started planning ahead for the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 on testnet. We're finalizing the last few remaining items planned\nfor 3.1 and will then build a testnet client for community testing. We'll\ncommunicate more details on the testnet release in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nIn the intro of this progress report, we've mentioned that several improvements\nhave been added to Particl Desktop, notably relating to Particl Marketplace.\n\nFor example, we've added a shortcut in the Send/Convert page to split a\ntransaction into multiple outputs, which should make it more visible as well as\neasier to set on a transaction-per-transaction basis. This has been a\nmuch-requested improvement by some of our vendors as it previously caused them\nsome issues, especially concerning the process of publishing listings.\n\nAlso, if something goes wrong during a transaction and one party does not\nreceive an updated order status from the other party (which means their client\ndidn't properly pick up the intended SMSG message), that other party can now\nsimply press a button that's been added to the order flow which conveniently\nallows for their last action status to be rebroadcast. It was possible to do\njust that in the past, but it required commands to be entered manually in the\nconsole window; a less-than-ideal user experience. This isn't needed anymore and\ncan be accomplished with the simple click of a button.\n\nSimilar to the item above, another button has been added. This one rescans SMSG\nmessages (executes the smsgscanbuckets command) for you, so in the case where it\nmight appear that an SMSG message was unproperly received, you can just click on\nthat button so that your client tries to find and process the message.\n\nAnother small change that was added is the display of a count of new listings\nthat are not yet displayed in the market browser. Previously, an alert indicator\nwould be displayed over the refresh button; this is still there but now a count\nof how many new items have been received is also displayed near the refresh\nbutton.\n\nAside from these, a variety of bug fixes and general improvements have been\nadded, as is usual, making this week one that ended up being quite productive\nand helpful in improving the general user experience.\n\nWith all of that being said, here's the list of remaining items to be included\nin Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress and is expected to be\n   wrapped up next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above item is completed. It is expected to resume next\n   week or so and is also expected to be wrapped up relatively quickly.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). While this task has seen some progress since it was started, it will\n   not be included in Particl Desktop 3.1 and is pushed for later on. \n\nKeeping the listed items above in mind, we will be starting the process of\nbuilding and releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet very soon. \n\nAs always, we'd rather not give a precise date or estimate for its release, but\nwe hope to begin the process towards the end of next week. We'll give you more\naccurate details on this in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl's Core Developer, Tecnovert, has focused mostly on Particl\nCore and on preparing the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIndeed, Particl Core 0.21.2.5 has been pre-released a couple of days ago and you\ncan now download and install it by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.5].

We'll also publish in that blog post a\ncomplete list of the new features and changes it will introduce.\n\nPlease note that, if you still have disabled outputs as a result of the\nemergency hardfork that happened earlier this year, you will need to submit your\nclaim to have them re-activated before the hardfork. Failure to do so means\nyou'll need to wait for the next, subsequent hardfork to have your outputs\nre-activated. To learn more about how to submit your claim, please refer to\nthis\nblog post [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\n\nAside from that, there have been some minor improvements made to BasicSwap's\nunderlying protocol, notably around its UI and the use of RingCT/CT swaps.

So see you all on Monday! Oh, right, it's time for our weekly development update first! ?</p><p>This week, most of the focus has been on adding a few key improvements to the marketplace and desktop client after receiving various feedback from the community. While these fixes may seem mundane to some, they fix relatively encumbering issues that affect both buyers and sellers in different cases. A few examples of these improvements will be given in the Particl Desktop progress report section of this blog post.</p><p>Additionally, we mentioned last week that, due to the larger-than-expected scope of adding digital items delivery, we were evaluating whether we'd include that feature in Particl Desktop 3.1 or not. After looking at the situation, we've opted not to include it. </p><p>A big reason for this decision is that Particl Desktop 3.1 now includes a lot of important and quality-of-life fixes and improvements over the initial mainnet release of Particl V3. Delaying their release would be counter-productive and unnecessary. Indeed, some of these fixes are relatively critical for some users, and so we're prioritizing releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 faster so that these users can benefit from the fixes and gain back a better user experience.</p><p>With that in mind, we've started planning ahead for the release of Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet. We're finalizing the last few remaining items planned for 3.1 and will then build a testnet client for community testing. We'll communicate more details on the testnet release in next week's progress report.</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-development-progress\">Particl Desktop Development Progress</h2><p>In the intro of this progress report, we've mentioned that several improvements have been added to Particl Desktop, notably relating to Particl Marketplace.</p><p>For example, we've added a shortcut in the Send/Convert page to split a transaction into multiple outputs, which should make it more visible as well as easier to set on a transaction-per-transaction basis. This has been a much-requested improvement by some of our vendors as it previously caused them some issues, especially concerning the process of publishing listings.</p><p>Also, if something goes wrong during a transaction and one party does not receive an updated order status from the other party (which means their client didn't properly pick up the intended SMSG message), that other party can now simply press a button that's been added to the order flow which conveniently allows for their last action status to be rebroadcast. It was possible to do just that in the past, but it required commands to be entered manually in the console window; a less-than-ideal user experience. This isn't needed anymore and can be accomplished with the simple click of a button.</p><p>Similar to the item above, another button has been added. This one rescans SMSG messages (executes the <code class=\"language-text\">smsgscanbuckets</code> command) for you, so in the case where it might appear that an SMSG message was unproperly received, you can just click on that button so that your client tries to find and process the message.  </p><p>Another small change that was added is the display of a count of new listings that are not yet displayed in the market browser. Previously, an alert indicator would be displayed over the refresh button; this is still there but now a count of how many new items have been received is also displayed near the refresh button.</p><p>Aside from these, a variety of bug fixes and general improvements have been added, as is usual, making this week one that ended up being quite productive and helpful in improving the general user experience.</p><p>With all of that being said, here's the list of remaining items to be included in Particl Desktop 3.1.</p><ul><li>Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once<strong> is now</strong> <strong>complete, </strong>but has received various bug fixes and improvements this week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images directly through the CSV file is <strong>still in progress and is expected to be wrapped up next week.</strong></li><li>The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better, more customizable formatting. <strong>This task has already been started but has been put on pause</strong> until the above item is completed. <strong>It is expected to resume next week or so and is also expected to be wrapped up relatively quickly.</strong></li><li>Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes, etc.). <strong>While this task has seen some progress since it was started, it will not be included in Particl Desktop 3.1 and is pushed for later on. </strong></li></ul><p>Keeping the listed items above in mind, we will be starting the process of building and releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet very soon. </p><p>As always, we'd rather not give a precise date or estimate for its release, but we hope to begin the process towards the end of next week.

This week has been one where we've focused on\nfixing a tricky issue with Particl Marketplace and have been exploring how best\nto release Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\nIndeed, an issue was brought to our attention in which some listing messages are\nnot being received by some markets. The problem seems to be related to two\nseparate issues, but both can occur at the same time. Out of these two issues,\none is already fixed but we are still busy investigating the second one\nespecially as it seems to deal with the way the marketplace validates the\nincoming listing messages and, for some reason, appears to be working on some\nmachines correctly but not on others. This makes tracking, and more importantly,\ntesting the problematic code a little trickier than expected. We are looking\ninto this and should have it fixed fairly soon.\n\nAs far as the progression regarding the delivery of digital items goes, there's\nbeen a number of stumbling blocks in getting this working properly. Indeed, it\nnow appears that it will require significantly more time than expected since it\ntouches on many more components of both Particl Desktop and the marketplace\nback-end code.\n\nIn other words, we cannot currently give any estimation yet on when this might\nbe ready and, for this reason, we've begun exploring releasing Particl Desktop\n3.1 without that feature. In fact, we do not want to drag the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 for too long. After releasing Particl V3 on mainnet, we've opted to\ngo ahead with more frequent releases and we intend on sticking to that\ncommitment. \n\nThat being said, even without digital items delivery being included in the next\nParticl Desktop update, we'll see the introduction of a few new features as well\nas a large number of bug/issue fixes and general improvements. Among them, we\ncan count on the addition of a seller-adjustable escrow ratio and various\nimportant seller-focused improvements, notably many new options for importing\ninventories and editing, in bulk, listing prices. The vast majority of these\nadditions have been suggested by Particl Marketplace sellers themselves and\nshould fix some of the most obvious pain points for them.\n\nAs we are giving a final look at what is still required to add the digital items\ndelivery feature, we'll let you know, in next week's progress report, whether\nwe've decided to release V3.1 with or without it. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). This task is in progress but is proving to be much more time-consuming\n   than initially expected. For this reason, we may de-prioritize this task in\n   favour of the other two and release Particl Desktop 3.1 without it. We will\n   be able to confirm if that is the case next week.\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap DEX Progress Report\nThis week on the Core side of things, a lot of testing has gone towards\nactivating Taproot on Particl.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
