Along with Bitcoin, Zcoin has recently been added to Particl\nDesktop and will be followed shortly by MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin.\n\nThis ability to add new coins to Particl has opened new doors and allowed\nParticl to work more closely with other blockchain projects. One such example is\nwith the Flare Wallet team.\n\nAs such, we are excited to announce that Flare Wallet has successfully\nintegrated cold staking for Particl on mobile and will be going live with the\nupdate somewhere next week. In exchange, Particl will be adding NIX to Particl\nDesktop V3.0, making it possible to easily swap NIX for PART to buy anything on\nthe Particl Marketplace without leaving any digital footprint behind.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Cold Staking on the Flare Wallet\nIn the next Flare Wallet update, you’ll be able to securely stake your PART\nusing their brand new integration of Particl’s cold staking protocol. You’ll be\nable to set it up by either connecting to a staking node or a staking pool\n[https://particl.wiki/learn/staking/pools#available-staking-pools]!\n\nThis update is scheduled for in a few days!\n\nWhat is Cold Staking?\nCold staking is, in simple terms, the ability to delegate the staking power of\nyour coins to an external staking node that contains no coin. This staking node\ncan be hosted on any device, whether at home, on a VPS (cloud servers), or on\nany internet-connected device. Its only purpose is to stake on the network on\nbehalf of other wallets.\n\nCold staking significantly improves the security of your funds when staking.\nSince you’re putting in charge an external node to do the staking, you can store\nyour coins on any sort of device, online or off-line. That can be a cold wallet,\na hardware device (i.e. Ledger or Trezor), a mobile wallet (Particl Copay or\nFlare Wallet), a multi-signature address, and etc.\n\nIf your staking node ever gets breached into or hacked, the attacker wouldn’t be\nable to steal any coin as the node itself contains no coin at all. All it’s\ndoing is staking on the network using the weight of coins stored securely\nsomewhere else.\n\nTo learn how to set up your own cold staking node, check out this tutorial: \nhttps://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\n\nGuide: Setting up Particl Cold Staking\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4]\nA Node, a Wallet and a Smart Contractparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4]\n\nAvailable on the Mobile Wallet\nIn just a matter of days, Flare Wallet will be pushing a new update to its\nmobile wallet which will enable cold staking for Particl.\n\nDon’t worry about the mobile data cost of staking.

Click Next.\n * Confirm the parameters of the swap and click Next.\n * Send the correct amount of Zcoin to the provided address. This can take\n   several minutes depending block times and StealthEx’s exchange process.\n * Check the Overview page to know when you receive your PART.\n\nUse Zcoin to Fund Your Account as Part of the Checkout Process\n * Install Particl Desktop\n   [https://particl.news/creation-of-the-default-wallet-on-the-particl-desktop-e39bc75c0978] \n   and enable the marketplace\n   [https://particl.news/enable-the-particl-marketplace-aa6ffa2c0ea8].\n * Make sure the StealthEx Swap Bot is enabled.\n * Browse the marketplace and add the item you want to purchase in your cart.\n * Click on the cart icon at the top of the Particl Desktop client and review\n   your order. Click Nextif everything is good.\n * Complete the check out process by entering your shipping details and\n   confirming your order.\n * A pop up will appear telling you that you don’t have enough PART to place the\n   order. Click on the Exchange BTC/alts button.\n * This will take you to the in-app swap engine with the number of Zcoin\n   required to complete the order pre-filled.\n * Swap Zcoin for PART using the in-app swap engine.\n * You will need to convert your balance to a private balance to use the\n   marketplace.\n * Once you receive your PART, click on the Send/Convert button from the left\n   sidebar.\n * Click on the Convert Public <-> Private tab at the top of the page.\n * In the Pay From section, select the source of funds you would like to\n   convert.\n * In the Convert To section, select the destination of funds you would like to\n   receive.\n * Type in the number of coins you’ve just received click on the Make Payment\n   button.\n * Review the transaction details and click on the Confirm & Send button to\n   confirm the transaction.\n * Wait for twelve (12) confirmations (approximately 24 minutes) before the\n   funds in the anon balance can be used.\n * You can track the status of this transaction nn the Overview page under\n   Recent Transactions.\n * Click the shopping cart icon at the top of your Particl Desktop client and\n   complete the process to place your order!\n\n> To track the progress of your swap, click on the Exchange button in the left\nsidebar and look for the ongoing exchange in the list that appears. Click on its\ntile to expand its details.\nGet Your Exclusive Swag Now!\nTo celebrate the listing of Zcoin on Particl, a few exclusive Zcoin goodies have\nbeen added to the marketplace for everyone to get. This includes shirts, caps,\nhoodies, and some very special mugs.\n\nFor the occasion, there are some pretty sweet but time-limited deals going on!\nFirst come, first serve, so make sure to hurry up!\n\n * First 20 shirts are 1 PART, the next 80 shirts will only be $5\n * First 10 hoodies are 1 PART, the next 20 hoodies will only be $5\n * First 20 mugs are 1 PART, the next 40 mugs will only be $5\n\n> Get them while the deal lasts!\nA Perfect Match for Privacy Nuts\nThe most interesting aspect of topping up your Particl account using Zcoin is\nthe compounding effect gained from combining different privacy protocols\ntogether. Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick\n[https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c].\n\nDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nBetter Together\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle. Particl also natively protects your online identity,\nsecure your communications, doesn’t collect or even generate any metadata about\nyou, and lets you hide your network identity (IP address). To see all the ways\nthat Particl protects your online privacy, read this in-depth blog post\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155] about it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Coin Would You Like to See on Particl?\nAdding Zcoin [https://zcoin.io/] is only a beginning. As Particl is a\nmarketplace for everyone, many more cryptocurrencies will be making their way\nonto Particl in the coming future.\n\nWhat coins would you like to see next? Are you a fan of a particular crypto\ncommunity and would love to use your favorite coin on Particl? Then let the team\nknow by filling the listing application form\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDtbFt1yp4Vhxf-5aPuL6QKCksc7oMlIlCvYlf8T9r6J-dgQ/viewform] \nlocated on Particl’s website [https://particl.io].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Zcoin\nZcoin (XZC) is an open-source, decentralized privacy coin that focuses on\nachieving privacy and anonymity for its users while transacting on the\nblockchain. It is the first to develop and implement the Sigma Protocol, which\nallows users to have complete privacy over their transactions via zero-knowledge\ncryptographic proofs without the need for trusted setup. Its research labs also\ncreated the Lelantus privacy protocol which has gained academic acclaim and set\nto go live on Zcoin in 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Zcoin made history by having the Thai Democrat Party’s elections held\non its blockchain with over 127,000 votes cast nationwide.\n\nAbout Particl\nParticl is a privacy-first and worldwide censorship-resistant eCommerce platform\nbuilt on blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. It restores the balance of\npower towards the individual, not corporations or authorities, by decentralizing\ncore aspects of today’s internet and economy.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and reliable multi-vendor marketplace\nthat lets anyone in the world buy and sell anything, without leaving a trace. It\neliminates the problems of trust, personal data abuse, and enrichment of large\ncorporations. It preserves privacy at any time and enables a trading scope for\nunbeatable product pricing. Free of any third-party interference, it creates a\nfair level playing field.\n\nThe Particl coin (PART) is the native currency of the Particl Marketplace. It is\na privacy coin that offers strong but flexible data protection and privacy\ncapabilities using a combination of the Confidential Transactions (CT) and\nRingCT (with Bulletproofs) privacy protocols. It is the first coin built on the\nBitcoin codebase to ever make these protocols available.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn More About Particl\n * What to expect in Particl V3.0\n   [https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n * All about Particl’s fundamentals\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/ffbzfw/particl_chart_prior_to_its_massive_update/]\n * Complete collection of useful links\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/pxu0py/getting_started/]\n * Join the community on Telegram [https://t.me/ParticlOn]\n * Join the community on Discord [https://discord.me/particl]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/1-w3OMndBq3t132yt3_iMkDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-way-to-shop-online\">The World’s Most Private Way to Shop Online</h3><p><strong>Zcoin</strong> has been added to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application as of this <strong>6th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC</strong>.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
