There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it, running servers, or having any sort of special\ncontrol over its network. Instead, it uses a mix of P2P and blockchain\ntechnologies, meaning that it is exclusively run by its global community of\nusers that are running nodes. It is, in most ways, pretty similar to how P2P\ntorrent networks operate and is the reason why they can’t be censored.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to securely buy and sell\ngoods and services, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in\nthe world. The marketplace requires no sign-up, no personal information, no\nsubscription, and is free of use. And because it is entirely decentralized,\nthere’s no staff or support team to manage disputes between a buyer and a\nseller. But that doesn’t mean there is no system to keep both parties honest in\nplace.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange and\ncommunications are encrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through\nthe Tor network. In other words, users of the marketplace are as anonymous as\nthe current privacy technologies of today allow you to be.\n\nTrusting the Other Party\nHowever, the combination of all the marketplace’s characteristics mentioned\nabove introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to trusting the other party\n(whether that be the buyer or the seller) when making a transaction on the\nmarketplace.\n\nOn traditional, centralized marketplaces, this isn’t the biggest of deals, at\nleast from the customer point of view. In fact, these platforms either have a\n“resolution center” in place or an escrow system where users can be assured that\nthe other party will behave honestly. And it works…in most cases\n[https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/top-ebay-scams-14781610].\n\nParticl, however, is entirely decentralized and private. That means there’s no\nstaff around to arbitrate issues and make sure all transacting parties are\nhonest between each other.\n\nSo then, how can you prevent the other party from not respecting their end of\nthe deal when their identity is private and when there is no central party that\ncan punish bad actors? Does the buyer send the payment first, and then hope his\nproduct arrives in a good shape, if at all? Or does the seller take the risk to\nship the item before receiving the payment? This all boils down to trust, and\ntrusting strangers on the web, especially when they use bleeding-edge privacy\ntechnologies\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd], has\nalways proven to be risky and, frankly, ill-advised.\n\nThat’s where Particl’s innovative dual deposit MAD escrow system comes into\nplay.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDual Deposit MAD Escrow System\nLike most marketplaces, Particl uses an escrow system to keep transacting\nparties honest. The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the\nsystem used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s \ncompletely trustless, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary\nto have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also \nfree of use, private-by-default, and fully autonomous between the buyer and the\nseller.\n\nAn escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one,\nit dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all\ntransaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and\nany other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two\ntransacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside\nparty looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no\nservices being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the\nescrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction\nand makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep\nhiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’\nschedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e.\nOpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).\n\nSo how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one\nanother without any third-party enforcing honesty?\n\nDual Deposits\nIn order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving\ndishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place.\nTypically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the\nmoderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and\nscrew one of the parties unfairly (hint: eCommerce platforms will almost always\nrule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller\n[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay]).\n\nOn Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms\nof dual deposits and game-theory.\n\nThe way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty\neffective. In a nutshell, when making a marketplace transaction, both parties\n(the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow\nsmart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the\nshipping costs. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in\nthe game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been\ncompleted satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party,\nat no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.\n\nTo visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth\n$100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110\nwhich is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and\nanother $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full\nand without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other\nhand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be\nfunding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be\nshipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means\nboth parties now have $220 on the line.\n\nWhile the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to\npackage and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s\ngoing to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the\ntransaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the\ntransaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both\nparties.\n\nMutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory\nThe reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves\nor tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the\ntransaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security\ndeposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security\ndeposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be\nsatisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the\nagreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.\n\nThis dynamic is often referred to as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction]. It is a well-known\nwar doctrine\n[https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/] \nbased on game-theory. The theory stipulates that if two countries are in\npossession of nuclear weapons, they won’t use them against each other. The\nreason for that is pretty simple — if one country launches a nuke towards the\nother party, it is almost guaranteed that the other country will retaliate and\nlaunch a nuke as well. The end scenario is that both countries will essentially\nannihilate each other with highly damaging weapons. In other words, both\ncountries lose and get turned into dust, hence why this game-theory is called \nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nThe effectiveness of that game-theory was on full display, in a real-world\nscenario, during the Cold War when both the US and Russia heavily threatened\neach other with nuclear warheads. Missiles were very visibly targeted at each\nrival country, but never was a nuclear attack initiated due to the fear of\nretaliation from the other country.\n\nHow Does That Theory Tie In With Particl’s Escrow System?\nParticl’s escrow is more of the same, only the game-theory doesn’t revolve\naround the use of nukes, but around financial losses. The important point to\nunderstand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that\nif one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence\nthe “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl,\nthat negative incentive is a net financial loss.\n\nIn fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive\ntheir security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s\nprecisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work\ntowards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of\nintermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds,\nand no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can\nsuccessfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for\nthe usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or\nbusiness-related data to any outside party or intermediary.\n\nThis model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no\noutside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between\nthe two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply\nchains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved\nwants a third-party to snoop in. There’s no account details being revealed to an\nescrow agent, no transaction history being looked at, no tracking number or\nshipping address being looked at, no conversation being logged, and so on.\nEqually as important, there’s also nothing traceable or identifiable being\npublicly written on the blockchain.\n\nPrivacy\nProbably the most powerful feature of this entire escrow mechanism is the fact\nthat all currency transactions are initiated using the powerful RingCT privacy\nprotocol. The escrow smart-contract itself works using the Confidential\nTransactions (CT) privacy protocol, but any incoming and outgoing transactions\nto it are done with RingCT. Check out this Particl Explained — Private\nTransactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef] \narticle for more details about how CT and RingCT transactions can be linked\ntogether.\n\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\n\nAnd because all transactions that occur on the marketplace have to go through\nthe escrow system, it means they’re all untraceable by design.\n\nThis ensures all marketplace transactions are fungible and as private as the\nnext one. It’s also a great way to grow the pool of private transactions (the\nnumber of RingCT outputs) that occur on the network, something that greatly\nenhances the quality of the privacy of the whole platform.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterested in learning more about Particl, its platform, and its marketplace?\nMake sure to keep an eye close to Particl.news [http://Particl.news] for regular\nnews, updates, and similar educational material.

The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the system used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s <strong>completely trustless</strong>, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary to have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also <strong>free of use</strong>,<strong> private-by-default</strong>, and <strong>fully autonomous</strong> between the buyer and the seller.</p><p>An escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one, it dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all transaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and any other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two transacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside party looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no services being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the escrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction and makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep hiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’ schedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e. OpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).</p><p>So how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one another without any third-party enforcing honesty?</p><h3 id=\"dual-deposits\">Dual Deposits</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-83zap8l7onknenEufi6rAg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving dishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place. Typically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the moderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and screw one of the parties unfairly (hint: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay\"><strong>eCommerce platforms will almost always rule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller</strong></a>).</p><p>On Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms of <strong>dual deposits</strong> and <strong>game-theory</strong>.</p><p>The way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty effective. In a nutshell, <strong>when making a marketplace transaction, both parties (the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow smart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the shipping costs</strong>. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in the game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been completed satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party, at no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.</p><p>To visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth $100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110 which is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and another $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full and without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other hand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be funding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be shipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means both parties now have $220 on the line.</p><p>While the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to package and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s going to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the transaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the transaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both parties.</p><h3 id=\"mutually-assured-destruction-mad-game-theory\">Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves or tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the transaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security deposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security deposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be satisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the agreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.</p><p>This dynamic is often referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\"><em><strong>Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</strong></em></a>. It is a <a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/\">well-known war doctrine</a> based on game-theory. The theory stipulates that if two countries are in possession of nuclear weapons, they won’t use them against each other. The reason for that is pretty simple — if one country launches a nuke towards the other party, it is almost guaranteed that the other country will retaliate and launch a nuke as well. The end scenario is that both countries will essentially annihilate each other with highly damaging weapons. In other words, both countries lose and get turned into dust, hence why this game-theory is called <em>Mutually Assured Destruction</em>.</p><p>The effectiveness of that game-theory was on full display, in a real-world scenario, during the Cold War when both the US and Russia heavily threatened each other with nuclear warheads. Missiles were very visibly targeted at each rival country, but never was a nuclear attack initiated due to the fear of retaliation from the other country.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-that-theory-tie-in-with-particl-s-escrow-system\">How Does That Theory Tie In With Particl’s Escrow System?</h3><p>Particl’s escrow is more of the same, only the game-theory doesn’t revolve around the use of nukes, but around financial losses. The important point to understand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that if one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence the “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl, that negative incentive is a net financial loss.</p><p>In fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive their security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s precisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work towards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of intermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds, and no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can successfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or business-related data to any outside party or intermediary.</p><p>This model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no outside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between the two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply chains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved wants a third-party to snoop in. There’s no account details being revealed to an escrow agent, no transaction history being looked at, no tracking number or shipping address being looked at, no conversation being logged, and so on. Equally as important, there’s also nothing traceable or identifiable being publicly written on the blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h3><p>Probably the most powerful feature of this entire escrow mechanism is the fact that all currency transactions are initiated using the powerful RingCT privacy protocol. The escrow smart-contract itself works using the Confidential Transactions (CT) privacy protocol, but any incoming and outgoing transactions to it are done with RingCT. Check out this <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef\"><strong>Particl Explained — Private Transactions</strong></a> article for more details about how CT and RingCT transactions can be linked together.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef\"><strong>Particl Explained - Private Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef\"><em>Anonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl Desktop, take privacy to the next level by not…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>And because all transactions that occur on the marketplace have to go through the escrow system, it means they’re all untraceable by design.</p><p>This ensures all marketplace transactions are fungible and as private as the next one. It’s also a great way to grow the pool of private transactions (the number of RingCT outputs) that occur on the network, something that greatly enhances the quality of the privacy of the whole platform.</p><hr><p>Interested in learning more about Particl, its platform, and its marketplace?

Then just CLICK HERE and\njump\nstraight to it! [https://particl.io/roadmap/]\nIn the past two weeks, we’ve taken a deep dive into Particl’s current status.\nWe’ve reviewed all of last year’s accomplishments for the project\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] and how its\nOpen Marketplace has evolved since being released\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02] on\nmainnet in August 2019. If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl\nis moving full steam ahead!\n\nHowever, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming\namount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important\nfact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting\nblockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering\nnew and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it\nneeds to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real\nworld”.\n\nLuckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in\nmentality from hype to real-world use-cases is precisely where the blockchain\nindustry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful.\n\nIndeed, the project’s current team [https://particl.io/team] and advisory board\n[https://particl.io/team] are composed of old-school crypto developers,\nlong-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in\nblockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt\nglobal eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking\nout the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible\nwhen relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.\n\nIn other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because\nblockchain is the new cool kid in town. No, it’s because its novel technology is\nbound to have a profound impact on an industry (eCommerce) in dire need of\nimprovements.\n\nThe Path Towards a Greater Adoption of Particl’s Marketplace\nParticl’s Open Marketplace may be live on mainnet, but it’s still Beta software.\nFor that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features,\nor seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s\nall normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after\nBeta).\n\nTo that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in\nits current form have been identified in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430].\n\n * Missing features\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\nThe good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things\nbecause it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, \nquite to the contrary\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d]\n. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.\n\nThat’s precisely with “making Particl adoption-ready” in mind that the Particl\nteam is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and\nbeyond! What’s scheduled to be improved? What features are planned to be\nintegrated? Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of\nthis article!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe New Roadmap is Here!\nParticl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers\nto entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, \neach roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in\ndetail in the Why? section of the roadmap.\n\nTo better plan ahead, it has also been separated into three different\ncategories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features,\nInnovators and Early Adopters. Each phase targets different types of users and\nhas its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items,\nit is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents,\nby user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.\n\nThe more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more\nlikely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also\nmakes the onboarding process increasingly easier.\n\nBefore getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important\npoints:\n\n * The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or\n   see their scope change at any time.\n * There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team\n   plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided,\n   at least for the moment.\n * The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any\n   particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t\n   necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.\n * The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the\n   Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These\n   will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.\n * While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and\n   UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an\n   ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020\nand beyond!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore Marketplace Layer / Key Features\nThis stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due\nto the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and\navailable features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but\nstill lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract\nnew users. At that stage, the entire project is still considered experimental\nand probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta. Even though\nthe marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (and\nthanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ? \n).\n\nMore information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have\nrecently been posted on Particl.news (1\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], 2\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02], 3\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430]).\n\nThe key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of\nmarkets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of\nthat for next to no fee.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInnovators Stage of Adoption\nIf you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is\nwhen it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of\norganic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will\nslowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of\npeople.\n\n“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and\nhave generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate\nabout new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users\nthat start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to\nignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e.\ngiving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know\nwill improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart\nParticl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.\n\nIn the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is\nlikely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and\nparticipants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because\nthey can’t find it elsewhere).\n\nThis phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly\ninteresting ones:\n\n * The fine-tuning of the Escrow (rate, optionality, …)\n * The possibility to run decentralized private auctions\n * A messaging system between buyers and sellers\n * The development SDK (for developers)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarly Adopters Phase of Adoption\nAfter the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early\nadopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher\nthan innovators.\n\nInstead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a\nvery urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as\nproviding them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other\nplatforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all\nsorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new\ntechnologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know\nthe rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them. Whereas innovators tend\nto be fine rushing in, testing out the platform, and help find its pain points,\nearly adopters expect a much more “adoption-ready” platform with as little\nproblems as possible (although they do expect the platform to not be 100%\nready).\n\nIn the specific case of Particl, this stage will likely attract the more\naggressive and opportunistic types of sellers and enterprises. This phase is\nmuch closer to being mainstream-ready, although it is not quite there yet.\n\n> Note: This section of the roadmap is preliminary. More items will be added to it\nas we inch closer to this phase of adoption.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Note\nIf you would like to help with Particl’s development and contribute to one of\nthe items within the roadmap, feel free to contact the team on any of the\nchannels available (Telegram, Discord, Riot, Reddit, etc) or by email\n[http://particl.io/team/].\n\nIf you would instead like to help out on getting new users onboard, then feel\nfree to contact Cryptoguard on any of the channels available (Telegram, Discord,\nRiot, Reddit, etc).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-zT-RLkPxcPnGTA0LSE5X8A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-decade-new-way-to-do-ecommerce-\">New Decade, New Way to do eCommerce! ?</h3><blockquote><a href=\"https://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>Want to see the new development roadmap right now?

They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know the rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them.

We’ve reviewed all of <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819\"><strong>last year’s accomplishments for the project</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02\"><strong>how its Open Marketplace has evolved since being released</strong></a> on mainnet in August 2019. If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl is moving full steam ahead!</p><p>However, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming amount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important fact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting blockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering new and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it needs to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real world”.</p><p>Luckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in mentality from hype to real-world use-cases is <strong>precisely where the blockchain industry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://particl.io/team\"><strong>the project’s current team</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://particl.io/team\"><strong>advisory board</strong></a> are composed of old-school crypto developers, long-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in blockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt global eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking out the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible when relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.</p><p>In other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because blockchain is the new cool kid in town. No, it’s because its novel technology is bound to have a profound impact on an industry (eCommerce) in dire need of improvements.</p><h3 id=\"the-path-towards-a-greater-adoption-of-particl-s-marketplace\">The Path Towards a Greater Adoption of Particl’s Marketplace</h3><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace may be live on mainnet, but it’s still Beta software. For that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features, or seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s all normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after Beta).</p><p>To that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in its current form have been identified in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)</strong></li></ul><p>The good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things because it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d\"><strong>quite to the contrary</strong></a>. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.</p><p>That’s precisely with “<strong>making Particl adoption-ready</strong>” in mind that the Particl team is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond!

In other words, <strong>each roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in detail in the Why? section </strong>of<strong> </strong>the roadmap.</p><p>To better plan ahead, <strong>it has also been separated into three different categories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features, Innovators and Early Adopters</strong>. Each phase targets different types of users and has its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items, it is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”.

That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.</li><li>The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.</li><li>While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases.

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it and having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nUndesirable Content\nThis, however, introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to the content being\nput on there. After all, how can you prevent anyone from buying or selling\nanything when there are no rules and no central party with special permissions\nto moderate it? Giving special permissions/powers and allowing certain users to\ndelete content and hold such a strong position of power is a slippery slope and,\non a long enough timeline, ultimately a slow crawl back to the old ways where a\ncompany would run its own platform, impose its rules, and charge fees.\n\nBut this isn’t what Particl is about. No, Particl is about full decentralization\nand complete privacy. The recent years, with all of the data breaches like\nEquifax’s and the abuse of data like with the constant scandals involving\nFacebook, have shown without a doubt that the tech industry needs to evolve and\nstart protecting its users.\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nAnd, because data has become so valuable and such a big target for hackers, we\ncannot expect or trust centralized models such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and\ncentral parties, to effectively secure our data.\n\nThis is why Particl’s Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and\nprivate-by-default. Its “trustless” nature, meaning that you do not need to\ntrust any entity to behave honestly, ensures that none of your data can be\ncollected by any party other than the ones you transact with. It is, simply put,\nthe next logical step in the evolution of eCommerce technology. But like any new\ngroundbreaking technology, it also introduces new challenges. Keeping the\nmarketplace free from undesirable listings is one of them.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nTo fight off undesirable content, Particl has put in place a completely\ndecentralized and provably fair governance mechanism where anyone can vote off\nundesirable listings.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts:\n * Voting power ratio: 1 PART coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold at time of publishing: -9,000 PART (adjustable)\n * Need to be staking?: No\n * Fee for flagging an item: Less than 0.001 PART for the first person to flag,\n   free for additional flaggers\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDelisting Threshold\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first user marks a listing as undesirable,\nit gets taken into a queue of previously flagged listings where other users will\nbe able to either agree that it should be taken off the marketplace, or disagree\nand vote for it to remain listed. For a listing to be completely delisted, its\nscore needs to reach a certain negative threshold.\n\nParticl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit\nupvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users\nupvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain\nnegative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other\nusers. Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.\n\nParticl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes\nfor a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s\nscore. It also deletes the listing from the user’s personal instance of the\nclient (deleted locally, but not hidden globally until the listing reaches the\ndelisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely\ndecentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that\ncreated multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and\nregister fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP\naddress, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes.\n\nInstead, Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote, which makes it impossible to\ngame the system. If you want to add more power to your votes, you can do it in a\nlegitimate way: acquire more PART coins. No matter how many wallets you use, or\nno matter how many times you try changing your IP address, the system only takes\nthe “coin weight” into consideration when counting votes. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the network can influence governance outcomes.\n\nThe delisting threshold of the Particl Open Marketplace will be -9,000 during\nthe first mainnet version. That threshold can and will be adjusted on the way\nforward. It may take a few tweaks until the perfect ratio is reached, but\nbecause game-theory is impossible to test on testnet (because test coins don’t\nhold any value), it has to be tested out in the wild.\n\nGame-Theory\nAs you probably now realize, this mechanism is actually pretty simple, but it’s\nalso quite strong and effective. The reason behind this is the whole game-theory \naspect of it.\n\nTo have significant voting power and single-handedly influence votes, a user\nneeds to acquire a lot of coins. This can be quite expensive depending on the\nactive delisting threshold ratio (in the first mainnet version of the\nmarketplace, that threshold will be -9,000), and it only gets more expensive as\nthe platform starts getting more network effect.\n\nAnd because voters have a direct financial stake in the network, they are\ndirectly incentivized to behave correctly. If voters colluded with each other\nand started trolling or censoring the marketplace, that would arguably reduce\nthe value of the network and incur a net loss for all co-conspirators.\n\nAdditionally, if users do not pro-actively keep the public interface of the\nmarketplace clean, it might result in a platform filled with undesirable or\nspammy content, which would contribute to driving people away. That, too, would\nseverely reduce the potential network effect and would be a serious obstacle to\nParticl reaching a more mainstream audience.\n\nSince voters are users with a financial stake in the network, driving users away\nfrom the platform is not something being desired. That is especially true of a\nmarketplace — more users mean more products to buy (for buyers) and more\npotential customers to reach (for vendors). That is why keeping the interface\nclean is a small, but not insignificant, contribution each user can make to the\nnetwork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ\n * What’s the delisting threshold?\n * The delisting threshold is currently at -9,000 for the first mainnet version\n   of the Open Marketplace. This threshold can and will be adjusted moving\n   forward.\n\n—\n\n * Will listings disappear after I vote them off?\n * When you flag a listing, it is deleted locally, meaning that it is taken off\n   your own personal instance of the marketplace, but not for other users. A\n   listing is only delisted from everyone’s marketplace instance once it reaches\n   the delisting threshold.\n\n—\n\n * Do I need to be staking to vote?\n * No, coins do not need to be staking. Anyone with a coin can vote.\n\n—\n\n * Can I vote if my coins are stored on a hardware device?\n * Not initially, but hardware device support is something being considered for\n   later in the future.\n\n—\n\n * Is there a fee for flagging listings?\n * If you are the first user to flag a listing that has never been flagged\n   before, you will need to be a sub-cent fee (0.00x PART or less). If you are\n   flagging a listing that’s already been flagged before, then there is no fee\n   to be paid.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Once the first user marks a listing as undesirable, it gets taken into a queue of previously flagged listings where other users will be able to either agree that it should be taken off the marketplace, or disagree and vote for it to remain listed. For a listing to be completely delisted, its score needs to reach a certain negative threshold.</p><p>Particl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit upvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users upvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain negative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other users. <strong>Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Decentralized-Marketplace-Moderation/1-4oviqSSL0DeUDYK6vFHdhg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes for a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s score. It also deletes the listing from the user’s personal instance of the client (deleted locally, but not hidden globally until the listing reaches the delisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely decentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that created multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and register fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP address, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes.</p><p>Instead, <strong>Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote</strong>, which makes it impossible to game the system. If you want to add more power to your votes, you can do it in a legitimate way: acquire more PART coins. No matter how many wallets you use, or no matter how many times you try changing your IP address, the system only takes the “coin weight” into consideration when counting votes. This ensures only those with a stake in the network can influence governance outcomes.</p><p><strong>The delisting threshold of the Particl Open Marketplace will be -9,000 during the first mainnet version.</strong> That threshold can and will be adjusted on the way forward. It may take a few tweaks until the perfect ratio is reached, but because game-theory is impossible to test on testnet (because test coins don’t hold any value), it has to be tested out in the wild.</p><h3 id=\"game-theory\">Game-Theory</h3><p>As you probably now realize, this mechanism is actually pretty simple, but it’s also quite strong and effective. The reason behind this is the whole <strong>game-theory</strong> aspect of it.</p><p>To have significant voting power and single-handedly influence votes, a user needs to acquire a lot of coins. This can be quite expensive depending on the active delisting threshold ratio (in the first mainnet version of the marketplace, that threshold will be <strong>-9,000</strong>), and it only gets more expensive as the platform starts getting more network effect.</p><p>And because voters have a direct financial stake in the network, they are directly incentivized to behave correctly.

This series\nwill explain some of the technical aspects of the Particl platform in a way that\neverybody can understand. These articles should give you a good base knowledge\nof the more technical features of the platform and can serve as pointers when\nexplaining a feature to a new community member or user of the platform.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency with varying levels of anonymity. In\nfact, using two different privacy protocols, users of the PART coin can choose\nbetween 3 types of transactions (public, blinded, anonymous) when making\npayments to other people or to addresses they own. Each of these transaction\ntypes carries its own level of privacy as well as its own set of properties.\n\nThis article will break down each of these transaction types and go into more\ndetails about them, explaining why and when you should use them. Privacy\ntransactions on Particl should have no secret for you anymore after reading\nthis!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * Public Transactions\n * Blinded Transactions (CT)\n * Rangeproofs\n * Bulletproofs\n * Anonymous Transactions  (RingCT)\n * Ring Signatures (MLSAG)\n * How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\n * Keeping a Good Level of Privacy\n * Stealth Addresses\n * CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublic Transactions\n * Privacy level: Low\n * Transaction cost: Low (~0.000346 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transactions weight by ~20%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n\n(Fee: 0.000346 PART)By default, when not manually selecting any privacy protocol\nto obfuscate your transactions on the blockchain, transactions are sent out as\n“public transactions”. And because Particl is based on the Bitcoin codebase,\nthey are recorded on the blockchain the same way you would expect Bitcoin\ntransactions to be recorded.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, it is\nquite the contrary. Bitcoin transactions (and Particl transactions, by proxy)\nare what we call pseudonymous transactions and they are pretty transparent.\nInstead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead\ntied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and\ncharacters.\n\nWhile that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties,\nthe advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too\neasy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain\nand tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a\npayment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment\nprocessors, vendors, etc.).\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy\nprotocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of\nthese protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators,\nbut also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as\ndifferent levels of privacy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)\nConfidential Transactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\nElements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.\nelementsproject.org\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\n\n * Privacy level: Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium (~0.001962 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n * Whitepaper: \n   https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n\n(Fee: 0.001962 PART)Blinded transactions are currency transactions that have their transacting\namounts hidden on the blockchain and only known by the two transacting parties\n(the sender and the receiver). This type of transaction uses the Confidential\nTransactions (CT)\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation] \nprivacy protocol which cryptographically guarantees that no more coins can be\nspent than are available. It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that does not\nrequire any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party.\n\nSending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl DesktopThis privacy protocol is\nentirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any trusted setup\n[https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/] and doesn’t require the assistance\nof any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols\nrequiring so-called “trusted setups [https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/]\n” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of \nmaster keys. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to\ndestroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those\nkeys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without\nanyone noticing it.\n\nTo prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the\ncorrect ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a rangeproof. In other\nwords, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a\ngiven transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what\nthat amount is.\n\nRangeproofs\nA rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to verify that a payment amount is\npositive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the\ntransaction. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so\nlarge that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be\ngenerated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and\nanother different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make\nthe commitments still sum to zero.\n\nThe downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain.\nTheir size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the\nbits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, rangeproofs take\nup the majority of a blinded transaction’s size.\n\nThis inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have\nto execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction\nnot only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain\ngrows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient\nto run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.\n\nThis scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has\nrefrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because\nthis project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a\nproper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came\nBulletproofs.\n\nBulletproofs\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nBulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically\nrather than linearly. In its whitepaper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf],\nthey are referred to as non-interactive zero-knowledge short proofs. In simple\nterms, Bulletproofs is a groundbreaking improvement over regular rangeproofs as \nthey reduce their size by around ~70%. And, because rangeproofs make up for the\nmajority of a CT transaction size, it in turn reduces transaction fees and the\nspace they take on the blockchain by the same ratio.\n\n> Fun fact: The term “Bulletproofs” was coined by Shashank Agrawal when he\ndescribed the new type of rangeproof as “short like a bullet, with bulletproof\nsecurity assumption”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnonymous Transactions — RingCT\n * Privacy level: High (Transacting amounts and participants are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium to high, depending on the number of mixins used in\n   the ring signatures or the size of the rings\n * Transaction cost for low privacy setting: ~0.003232 PART\n * Transaction cost for high privacy setting: ~0.009032 PART\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transaction weight by ~47%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces rangeproofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: No\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n\n(Fee: 0.005708 PART for 8 ring members and 2 inputs)Anonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl Desktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not only hiding the transacting amounts but\nalso the identity of the transacting parties (the sender and the receiver). This\ntype of transaction uses the RingCT privacy protocol, a protocol made popular by\nMonero but adapted to work with the Bitcoin codebase by the Particl team. This\nallows the platform to benefit from the industry-leading privacy protocol that\nis RingCT but still leverage the security, stability, and developer community of\nBitcoin. In other words, RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase is like having your cake\nand eating it too. The good, without the bad.\n\nSending an anon transaction (RingCT) with 22 ring members on Particl DesktopGood\nexamples of this include RingCT being able to be used, with the help of special\nscripts, on atomic swaps, decentralized applications (i.e. Particl’s Open\nMarketplace), the Lightning Network, and etc. It also enables RingCT to be\ndirectly linked to CT transactions so that it can reach full programmability, as\nwe’ll see later in this article.\n\nJust like blinded transactions, which use the CT protocol, anonymous\ntransactions are entirely trustless and don’t rely on any sort of trusted setup.\nIt’s important to note that RingCT transactions are also a bit bigger than\nConfidential Transactions, although not by a big margin. This is due to the\naddition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.\n\n> Fun fact: RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase\n(Monero). The Particl team is the first team to ever develop a custom\nimplementation that could work on any other codebase, in this case, the Bitcoin\ncodebase.\nRing Signatures (MLSAG)\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of MLSAG: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nMultilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures (MLSAG), or ring\nsignatures, is the Ring part of RingCT. It is a type of digital signature that\nis performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs \n(represented by Anon balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then impossible for\nany observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is\nthe output actually sending out the transaction.\n\nWikipedia describes ring signatures as follow\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature]: “A ring signature is a type of \ndigital signature [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature] that can be\nperformed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a\nmessage signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular\ngroup of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it\nshould be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’\nkeys was used to produce the signature.”.\n\nIn RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have\noriginated from any member of the ring group. Users put some of their funds\nwithin an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute\nRingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously\nsigns it by using other RingCT outputs as decoys and produces a signature that,\nwhen verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of\nthe RingCT outputs used by the ring group. It is not possible to know who really\nmade the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being\nused by the ring group as a decoy.\n\nThis effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction— the\namount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It\nalso arms transacting parties with a very strong plausible deniability (1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability], 2\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption]).\n\nHow to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\nA RingCT transaction containing 24 ring membersOn Particl Desktop, it is\npossible to pick the number of members you want to have within the ring group \nyou’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is\nreferred to as NO. OF RING SIGS.\n\nWhat it means is simple, for every input used to generate your transaction, a\nnumber of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could\nhave been signed by any of the 24 participants. In the screenshot just above,\nthe value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender\nof the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1\ninput). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each\ninput, with 3 different ring groups of 24 participants each, will be generated\nin order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t\nworry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as\neasy to send as any other type of transaction.\n\nTo make a RingCT transaction, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the\nAnontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO.\nOF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The\nvalue you pick will be equal to the number of ring members that will be part of\nyour ring group. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the\ndefault level of privacy (8 ring members). This represents a good balance\nbetween privacy and cost.\n\n> Note: The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more\nexpensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members\n(RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it\ngets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a\ntransaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring\nmembers as possible and with as many inputs as possible.\nKeeping a Good Level of Privacy\nAs a general rule of thumb and in theory, RingCT gets more private as more\npeople convert their public balances into Anon balances, thus creating more Anon \noutputs to be used by ring groups for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT\nrelies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed\na transaction, and the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the\nstronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets.\n\nBut, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain,\nthey’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason\nthe protocol behaves this way is in response to this research paper\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/] which demonstrates that real inputs can be\nguessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the\nchain and haven’t had transactions for a while.\n\nFor this reason, it is recommended that all users keep with them an Anon balance \nwhich can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of\ncourse). Additionally, it is also recommended that users transact as much as\npossible with Anon transactions so that it can contribute to enhancing the\nentire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute\na RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient\nit becomes for everyone.\n\nThis is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to\nuse RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best\nway to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual\nusage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s\nmain application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s\nRingCT protocol a very solid one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStealth Addresses\nAdditionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular,\npublic addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy\nbecause only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it\nor not. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can\nreceive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time\naddress’ for that output/transaction.\n\nWithout knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link\nand guess which outputs match which stealth address. This helps in protecting\nthe identity of the receiver of a transaction.\n\nOn their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions\ninformation from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but\nwhen combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides\nyet another layer of privacy for the user.\n\nAs it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be\nexecuted to stealth addresses.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\nBoth privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable\ndifferences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has\nprogrammable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as\nis, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that does not mean,\nhowever, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is\nthat possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? This is one of the\nbig reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network\ninstead of just one of them.\n\nIn fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in\nsmart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of\nParticl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for\nanything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.\n\nThe best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace.\nIt is a private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize\nmarketplace transactions. What few people know is that the marketplace actually\nuses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for\nits escrow system, not RingCT.\n\nThat’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract\nfunctionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence\nwhy it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to\nsend a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically\nconverts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets\nreleased by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a\nRingCT transaction.\n\n> A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of\nthe escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it\nwill directly be released to a RingCT output.— Kewde [https://github.com/kewde/]\n, Particl Developer and OMP Library\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/]Author\nThis is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and\nleverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same\nsort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or\nservices such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized\napplications, and etc.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more \nParticl Explained articles will be posted on particl.news [http://particl.news] \nin the future.\n\nThe Particl team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Instead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead tied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and characters.</p><p>While that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties, the advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too easy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain and tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a payment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment processors, vendors, etc.).</p><p>For this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy protocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of these protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators, but also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as different levels of privacy.</p><hr><h2 id=\"blinded-transactions-confidential-transactions-ct-\">Blinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)</h2><p><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><strong>Confidential Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><em>Elements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.</em>elementsproject.org</a></p><ul><li><em>Privacy level: <strong>Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost: <strong>Medium (~0.001962 PART)</strong></em></li><li><em>Segwit: <strong>Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Bulletproofs: <strong>Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Trusted setup: <strong>No</strong></em></li><li><em>Programmable outputs: <strong>Yes</strong></em></li><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><em><strong>https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>(Fee: 0.001962 PART)</figcaption></figure><p>Blinded transactions are <strong>currency transactions that have their transacting amounts hidden on the blockchain</strong> and only known by the two transacting parties (the sender and the receiver).

It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that <strong>does not require any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-q2ZhXl4uqiCXm9IfbIAQuA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Sending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>This privacy protocol is entirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any <a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setup</strong></a> and doesn’t require the assistance of any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols requiring so-called “<a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setups</strong></a>” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of <em>master keys</em>. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to destroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those keys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without anyone noticing it.</p><p>To prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the correct ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a <strong>rangeproof. </strong>In other words, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a given transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what that amount is.</p><h3 id=\"rangeproofs\">Rangeproofs</h3><p>A rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to<strong> verify that a payment amount is positive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the transaction</strong>. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so large that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be generated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and another different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make the commitments still sum to zero.</p><p>The downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain. Their size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the bits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, <strong>rangeproofs take up the majority of a blinded transaction’s size</strong>.</p><p>This inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have to execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction not only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain grows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient to run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.</p><p>This scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has refrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because this project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a proper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came Bulletproofs.</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs\">Bulletproofs</h3><ul><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><strong>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</strong></em></a></li><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>Bulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically rather than linearly.

It’s important to note that RingCT transactions are also a bit bigger than Confidential Transactions, although not by a big margin. This is due to the addition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.</p><blockquote><strong>Fun fact: </strong>RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase (Monero). The Particl team is the first team to ever develop a custom implementation that could work on any other codebase, in this case, the Bitcoin codebase.</blockquote><h3 id=\"ring-signatures-mlsag-\">Ring Signatures (MLSAG)</h3><ul><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of MLSAG: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><em>Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures</em> (MLSAG), or ring signatures, is the <em>Ring</em> part of <em>RingCT</em>. It is a <strong>type of digital signature that is performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs</strong> (represented by <em>Anon</em> balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

The negative output would make the commitments still sum to zero.</p><p>The downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain. Their size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the bits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, <strong>rangeproofs take up the majority of a blinded transaction’s size</strong>.</p><p>This inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have to execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction not only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain grows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient to run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.</p><p>This scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has refrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because this project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a proper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came Bulletproofs.</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs\">Bulletproofs</h3><ul><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><strong>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</strong></em></a></li><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>Bulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically rather than linearly.

This is due to the addition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.</p><blockquote><strong>Fun fact: </strong>RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase (Monero).

It is a <strong>type of digital signature that is performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs</strong> (represented by <em>Anon</em> balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.
