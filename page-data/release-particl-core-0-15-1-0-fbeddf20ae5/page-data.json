The app talks with a virtual server that hosts the\n   Particl blockchain and latest codebase.\n\nParticl Core cli and qt clients— included\n\n * Core ships with two wallets: cli (a command line interface) and qt (a graphic\n   user interface). Both versions are always included in Particl official builds\n   and talk to the latest codebase they are packaged with.\n\nIn short, if you are running Particl Wallet or Particl Copay, you don’t need to\ndo anything. The next time you open each app they will call up Particl Core\n0.15.1.0 automatically.

Congratulations! You’ve initiated the Cold Staking Activation Process\n\nThe Cold Staking box on your dashboard should now show a Cold Staking Progress\nbar. It is very important to follow the instructions in the box that says, \n“Please keep this wallet online until the cold staking activation process is\ncomplete.”\n\nKeep in mind, it may take several weeks to finish the activation process. With\neach stake the percentage increases towards 100%.\n\nSummary\nThis guide is now complete. Here is a list of accomplishments you have achieved\nby reaching the end.\n\n * Created a Staking Node wallet\n * Created a Staking Node Public Key\n * Linked a Staking Node wallet with 0 PART to a 2nd wallet on another computer\n   that has the PART you want to stake.\n * Unlocked wallet with PART tokens for staking only\n * Enabled the Cold Staking Activation Process\n\nOnce you’ve reached 100% complete on the Cold Staking progress bar your two\nwallets are linked. The staking node wallet needs to be online 24/7 to receive\nstaking rewards. The wallet holding your PART tokens can be offline, safe and\nsecure.\n\nFor more information on Particl Cold Staking we created a primer here:\n\nPrimer: Cold Staking on Particl\n[https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac]\nQuantum Computer Resistantparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Who said creating smart contracts had to be complicated?","html":"<h3 id=\"a-node-a-wallet-and-a-smart-contract\">A Node, a Wallet and a Smart Contract</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Guide--Setting-up-Particl-Cold-Staking/0-0Rji14Eh7rHqdiuY.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"components-of-cold-staking\">Components of Cold Staking</h2><ul><li>A <strong>Staking Node</strong> — running a new wallet</li><li>A <strong>Wallet</strong> with your PART tokens</li><li>A <strong>Cold Staking Script </strong>— this is like the script in bitcoin or smart contracts on other alts</li></ul><p>The <strong>Staking Node</strong> is a computer running Particl that is always on and always connected to the internet.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
