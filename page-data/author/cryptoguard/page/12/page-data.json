And on that note, we'd like to respond to the few questions\nwe've had this week related to the launch of BasicSwap's open beta.\n\nAs most of you know, BasicSwap is currently in its closed beta phase\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]. What this means is\nthat it's currently being tested, on mainnet, by a closed group of beta testers.\nOnce we open the beta to the public, it'll then be possible for anyone to test\nit out on their own and swap cryptocurrencies with others.\n\nHowever, there are a few requirements for this to happen. First, BasicSwap's\ninitial user interface has to be completed. That's because the current version\nof BasicSwap is mostly dedicated to advanced users and may be difficult to\nnavigate through for some users. Secondly, there are still a few backend\nimprovements, including the setup process, that are in the works to make the\nplatform more user-friendly and stable. \n\nThese requirements are necessary to make BasicSwap more accessible and reduce\nthe time cost of troubleshooting issues with beta testers. In other words, it\nmakes public testing of the DEX more efficient. Once these are complete, we'll\nbe ready to launch the open beta phase of BasicSwap. \n\nDon't worry, we'll announce it in advance so that you can tell other people to\ncome to try it out!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe thank you all for your passion, dedication, and valuable contributions to the\nParticl project; you are what makes Particl possible!\n\nWhether you actively work on expanding the ecosystem or simply use the\nmarketplace and send your feedback to the team, every bit helps shaping the\nfuture of de-commerce (decentralized e-commerce) and easing its adoption!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and we'll see you, like always, back on Monday ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This week, a lot of focus has been put on adding seemingly small but\nquite useful features and improvements to Particl Marketplace.\n\nOther than that, a good amount of focus has also gone into fixing a few minor\nissues and adding general improvements based on various feedback obtained from\nParticl Marketplace users. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop and Marketplace Progress Update\nAs part of the additions and improvements mentioned in the introduction of this\nprogress report, there are four main items worth mentioning, the others being\nvery minor.\n\n 1. Combined the market ID and access/publish key into a single value. This\n    means that there's now only a single value that needs to be copied/used when\n    sharing/joining a market. This is mostly a convenience modification; instead\n    of needing two different values, a single value can be shared.\n 2. Modified how a template for the product is edited. This was required mostly\n    because the large \"Edit Product\" button on a template resulted in the\n    product template being modified, leading to confusion when an existing\n    market template is published and did not contain the modified content. So\n    now the button to edit the market template has been made a little more\n    visible, and the edit product button has been moved to a different location\n    to ensure that it's easier to understand how to edit an existing item.\n 3. Removing the forced requirement to have the Open Market automatically joined\n    and the ability to remove it from the list of markets your client is\n    connected to. This task is in progress and should be completed imminently.\n 4. Displaying a different graphic and message to indicate when no listings are\n    found but the blockchain is still busy syncing. This is part of a wider push\n    to improve various aspects of the marketplace application that may cause\n    confusion, especially to people who are trying Particl for the first time.\n    You can expect a few updates sharing this goal to be included in the next\n    Particl Desktop update.\n\nWhile the aforementioned items are what received the vast majority of this\nweek's focus, we can confirm that in-market messaging (buyer <> seller\nmessaging) is still the primary priority when it comes to new features for\nParticl Desktop 3.2. \n\nAs previously mentioned, this is an early implementation of a wider \"chat\napplication\" that will ultimately let you discuss with others in total privacy\n(no metadata) and without any central server in between processing and passing\nmessages around. The \"in-market\" implementation, namely the ability for buyers\nand sellers to talk to each other on the marketplace, is the first version of\nthat broader vision.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl core developer, Tecnovert, has been busy backporting Taproot\ninto the Particl Core 0.19 codebase. While Taproot will be fully functional on\n0.21 following this coming hardfork\n[https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/] (1st of February at 17:00 UTC),\nit wouldn't be the case for Particl Core 0.19 without these current\nmodifications.\n\nTaproot Hardfork Announcement (February 2022)Learn everything you need to know\nabout Particl’s upcoming hardfork and prepare ahead with Particl Core\n0.19.2.18.\nParticl Newscryptoguard [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/]And\nbecause Particl currently uses both the 0.19 and 0.21 codebases, it's important\nto ensure that Taproot is compatible and recognized by 0.19 nodes so that no\nissue arises. But more than that, we are happy to report that 0.19 nodes will\nalso be fully compatible with Taproot, just like 0.21, meaning they will not\nonly recognize Taproot transactions but offer full support for it as well.\n\nAside from this rather large task, Tecnovert has spent a good amount of time\nwriting and running tests to make sure the upcoming hardfork goes through\nwithout any issue.\n\nRenewed Particl Team Funding Proposal is Open for Discussion\nAlthough not a development update per se, we wanted to let you know that the\nParticl team has published, on the CCS platform\n[/particl-development-progress-report-15-01-2022/ccs.particl.io], its renewed\nfunding request [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/12].\n\nTeam Funding Proposal #2Learn all the details about the Particl team’s second\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-2/]As a reminder, the Particl team\nis funded exclusively from the network's decentralized treasury. Every six\nmonths, the team needs to renew its funding with a clear proposal that has to\nget approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nWith the first funding cycle coming to an end in February, the team's second\nfunding request has been published earlier this week and is currently open for\ndiscussion.

It requests 35,250 PART per month from the treasury fund for a period of\n6\nmonths only after which the team will submit a new funding...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/12]> Reminder: You, and anyone else, can submit proposals on the CCS platform and\nrequest funds from the treasury to support projects and initiatives that improve\nthe Particl ecosystem. This team proposal is just one example of what anyone can\npropose to Particl stakeholders.\nTable of Contents\n * Progress Since the First Funding Request\n * The Funding Request in Details\n * Vision and Development Priorities\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Since the First Funding Request\nAbout 6 months ago, the Particl team started drawing funds from the treasury\nafter its first funding request was approved by Particl stakeholders. Since that\ntime, we’ve worked on improving and expanding the ecosystem with various\nimprovements and additions. \n\nHere’s a brief list of what we’ve done since being granted funds from the\ntreasury.\n\n * Particl V3 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/])\n * Particl V3.1 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/])\n * Announce BasicSwap, a cross-chain and private DEX, and prep it for its open\n   beta (learn more [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/])\n * New Particl.io website (check it out [https://particl.io/])\n * New roadmap (check it out [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/])\n * Published our short to mid-term marketing plans (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/])\n * 10 Particl Core releases, including 0.21.x.x pre-releases (learn more\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Scheduled a new hardfork to fully activate Taproot (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/])\n * Particl Electrum wallet with Lightning Network support (work-in-progress\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-10-09-2021#particl-core-development-report]\n   )\n * New legal entity formed to support the project\n\nRoadmap Progress\nAside from the project-wide milestones mentioned above, we’ve also made great\ndevelopment progress. Here are the roadmap items we’ve completed or made\nprogress to during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We announced that we would be releasing a new app into the Particl\necosystem; BasicSwap. BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange (DEX) protocol that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another\nwithout any middleman or third-party being involved. It is currently in closed\nbeta; its open beta is expected to begin very shortly in early 2022. \n\nWeb framework Although we haven’t officially communicated on this yet, we’ve\nmade preliminary progress in building certain aspects of what will allow Particl\napps, like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap, to be accessible from the web. We\nwill be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are\nlikely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at\nonce. We’ll have more information to share a bit later on. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality We’ve released an update to the cold staking zap\nfunctionality that allows for more a granular management of the zapping process.\nThe process has been optimized and made more private. You can also now choose\nbetween two zapping options; optimized for staking or optimized for privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Although not yet released, we’ve worked on a new light wallet\nfor Particl: Particl Electrum. It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum\nwallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need\nto sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in\nsome of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides\n\"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the\nblockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the\nLightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to\nParticl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment. \n\nTaproot Support In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the\nlong-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new\nfeatures and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/]. \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import/management We added to Particl Desktop 3.1 many\nimprovements to the inventory management aspect of the marketplace. Sellers now\nhave access to more options when importing their inventory from CSV files and\ncan easily adjust their product prices in bulk to account for any PART price\nchanges. A notable variety of other improvements related to the management and\npublishing of listings has also been added. \n\nAdjustable escrow deposit ratios A major item we’ve completed with Particl\nDesktop 3.1 is the addition of a customizable security deposit ratio for\nmarketplace escrows. Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock\n100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security\ndeposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with\nParticl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios\nbetween 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from\nmarketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and\nuse-cases. \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two major additions mentioned\nabove, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added\nto Particl Marketplace. Because there is way too much to mention here, we invite\nyou to check out the full list of changes available here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements Various additions, improvements, and bug\nfixes have been made to Particl Desktop. These are changes that are not\nexclusive to the marketplace app itself. Just like with the general marketplace\nimprovements, the list of changes is too big to put here; we invite you to check\nout the full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nThe Funding Request in Details\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests supporting the Particl team and funding its\noperations by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for 6 months\n. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will\nthen publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes\nother than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be\nallocated.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap\n   (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile\n   platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the\n   development team.\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this\n   funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words,\n   not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds\n   being available for later on.\n * Management, legal, and administration (10%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (10%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products.

Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the\nteam may rearrange it as needed.\nVision and Development Priorities\nAfter spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a\nlot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind\nyou, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year,\nthere’ll be much more to show for it.\n\nIn fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s\nthe time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger\ndifference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much\neasier than it was before.\n\nDevelopment Priorities\nWith this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6\nmonths. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we\nconstantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be\nadded to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an\never-evolving situation.\n\nFor more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by\nfollowing this link [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/].\n\nNew Roadmap Revealed (2021)Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn\nabout the next critical steps forward.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/] General\nBasicSwap DEX BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022.\nWith its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and\npublicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to\nannounce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that\nregard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other\nlevel, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s\ngeneral adoption and exposure within the space. \n\nWeb framework The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl\napplications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser\nwithout the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to\ndownload any application. This item will be delivered in increments and we\nexpect that we'll deliver some of the first components of this system during\nthis development cycle. It is a major part of making Particl more accessible to\nthe world and easing its adoption. \n\nKeeping Particl Core up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin code As you probably\nalready know, the Particl coin is a next-generation privacy coin. It uses RingCT\nand CT, much like Monero, but uniquely uses the Bitcoin codebase. As is usual,\nwe pledge to keep its code up-to-date with all the Bitcoin updates, which is\ncritical both in terms of security and usability. \n\nParticl Electrum This new Particl light wallet, based on the very popular\nBitcoin Electrum wallet, provides a lot of “light” functionalities that can be\nleveraged for the many projects we have in mind, notably putting together a new,\nbetter mobile wallet for example. Although that mobile wallet might not see the\nday during the first half of 2022, we expect that, at least, Particl Electrum\nwill. \n\nSMSG 2.0 To ensure that Particl can sustain a much larger number of users, and\nto improve the reliability and performance of applications such as Particl\nMarketplace and the BasicSwap DEX, an update to Particl’s SMSG network is\nplanned for 2022. While we don’t fully expect it to be ready by the end of this\n6-month development period, we are confident that we’ll be making valuable\nprogress towards it. \n\nMarketplace\nBuy flow messaging This Particl Marketplace feature will let buyers and sellers\ncommunicate directly from within Particl Desktop. This is a widely-requested\nfeature that will massively improve the user experience of the marketplace and\nimprove its potential for adoption. This is a preliminary version of a more\ncomplete “chat application” that will eventually serve as a distributed and\nprivate alternative to messaging applications such as a Signal, Telegram,\nElement, etc. \n\nMobile and web gateway (buyers) As we incrementally build components of the web\nframework, they make available some low-hanging fruits. This is the case, for\nexample, of both a web and mobile gateway for buyers. They would make it\npossible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and\npurchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain\nand SMSG network. The early versions of these gateways are expected to be\nrelatively basic but will serve as a good showcase of what the web framework\nwill ultimately allow. \n\nDesktop\nSMSG controller integration The SMSG controller is more of a back-end\ndeliverable that improves how Particl applications interact with the SMSG\nnetwork. While this item may not lead to apparent changes to the end-user, it\nmakes Particl applications more efficient and lets them support more complex\nfeatures. This is a requirement for more advanced SMSG functionalities such as\napplication extensions and desktop plugins (formerly known as “SMSG bots”). \n\nApp extensions and plugins App extensions and Particl Desktop plugins are\nadd-ons that enhance the user experience. Often, they are third-party services\nthat provide valuable functionality such as allowing you to swap\ncryptocurrencies from the desktop app, get price data through oracles, and so\non. While Particl itself is entirely decentralized, these opt-in modules provide\nuseful features that might require third-parties to get involved. By being\nopt-in rather than opt-out, we ensure that only those looking to use those extra\nservices have to deal with the added level of centralization they require. \n\nHardware wallet integration Another widely-requested feature from some of our\nmost security-conscious community members, building hardware integration into\nParticl Desktop will let you connect your favorite hardware wallet (i.e.,\nTrezor, Ledger Nano) and manage the funds it contains without having to use a\nseparate Particl wallet (Particl-Qt). This will let you use Particl Desktop, and\nits applications, without having to make security compromises. \n\nMarketing\nAs for marketing, our plans remain in line with what we’ve recently announced a\nfew weeks ago in our marketing blog post\n[https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/]. Indeed, we intend to\nkeep on gradually ramping up various marketing and outreach efforts as our line\nof products expands and as the barriers to adoption are taken down by the\nrelease of new key features.\n\nHowever, we are planning for a bigger marketing push related to the full release\nof BasicSwap. As we’ve mentioned in the past, we are highly confident in the\nimpact this upcoming DEX will have on the project, not only because of its\nobvious usefulness for the project but also because of the added exposure it\nwill bring to the ecosystem.\n\nDon’t forget, trading is still the number one use-case for cryptocurrencies and\nit’s becoming harder to trade by the day as most exchanges are becoming\nincreasingly restrictive; the release of BasicSwap comes at a very opportune\ntime and will fix a lot of the issues traders face nowadays.\n\nHow to Vote\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this Particl Wiki tutorial\n   [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management.

Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock 100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security deposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%.

Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an ever-evolving situation.</p><p>For more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by following <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\">this link</a></strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">New Roadmap Revealed (2021)</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn about the next critical steps forward.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/62859ff1f762453131dee5a6d2c3d04b/medium-roadmap-particl-2021.jpg\"></div></a></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>General</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022.

We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet.

BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another without any middleman or third-party being involved. It is currently in closed beta; its open beta is expected to begin very shortly in early 2022.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Web framework</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Although we haven’t officially communicated on this yet, we’ve made preliminary progress in building certain aspects of what will allow Particl apps, like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap, to be accessible from the web. We will be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are likely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at once. We’ll have more information to share a bit later on.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h3>Blockchain and Coin</h3>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">Improved zap functionality</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            We’ve released an update to the cold staking zap functionality that allows for more a granular management of the zapping process.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

Sellers now have access to more options when importing their inventory from CSV files and can easily adjust their product prices in bulk to account for any PART price changes. A notable variety of other improvements related to the management and publishing of listings has also been added.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck2\">Adjustable escrow deposit ratios</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            A major item we’ve completed with Particl Desktop 3.1 is the addition of a customizable security deposit ratio for marketplace escrows. Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock 100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security deposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from marketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and use-cases.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck3\">A ton of general improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Aside from the two major additions mentioned above, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added to Particl Marketplace.

Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, <strong>the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\"><strong>Funding Distribution Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an ever-evolving situation.</p><p>For more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by following <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\">this link</a></strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">New Roadmap Revealed (2021)</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn about the next critical steps forward.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/62859ff1f762453131dee5a6d2c3d04b/medium-roadmap-particl-2021.jpg\"></div></a></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>General</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022. With its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and publicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other level, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s general adoption and exposure within the space.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck2\">Web framework</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl applications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser without the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to download any application.

They would make it possible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and purchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain and SMSG network.

development progress\nreport! This week, we've got some interesting news for you as well as a little\nappetizer for what's coming next week.\n\nThe week began with the release of Particl Desktop 3.1, the first update to\nParticl V3. this release introduces adjustable escrow ratios (sellers can decide\nhow much they require buyers to put into escrow) and better inventory management\nfor sellers. It also includes a wide variety of bug fixes, general improvements,\nand quality-of-life tweaks that makes the user experience much better and\nhassle-free. You can see the release blog post by following this link\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/].\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 Live on MainnetThe long-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.1\nupdate is now available on mainnet!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/]Following its\nrelease, some work has gone towards fixing two minor issues encountered by\nusers; the fixes will be part of the next update. But perhaps more exciting is\nthe fact that the team has begun working on the first version of an in-market\ncommunication tool that lets buyers and sellers communicate together. \n\nTo quote Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer on the topic: \"The idea here\nis to provide a mechanism to allow for buyers (and potential buyers) and sellers\nto communicate with each other and have the application alert them using\nnotifications. Something like group/individual chat/messaging applications, but\nwhere the subject is the listing or order in question. \n\nParticl Desktop should then also alert the user to the presence of messages or\nresponses. This is mostly a stop-gap to a future, more complete implementation,\nbut for now it should at least provide a means to interact with the other party\ndirectly, particularly when additional information is required for an order or\nprior to purchasing an item.\".\n\nThis in-market communication feature is one of the first items we'll be working\non delivering in the short-term. In fact, you can expect much more information\nabout the team's plans for the next 6 months as we will publish, next week, our\nsecond funding request on the CCS platform. The proposal will be accompanied, of\ncourse, by an in-depth blog post with all the information you need to know. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nAs mentioned above, this week has been about releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 and\nfixing two minor issues identified by users after its release. The rest of the\nweek has been spent on developing the in-market communication feature, but also\nanother goodie which we'll be revealing next week (got to keep some mystery in\nthe air, after all).\n\nStarting next week, we expect to resume this section's deliverable checklist\napproach as has been the case for the most part of 2021. \n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nAs has been typical for the past few weeks, Particl's core developer, Tecnovert,\nhas spent the week working on Particl Core and BasicSwap.\n\nWhile there is nothing too exciting to report in regards to Particl Core, the\nsame can't be said of BasicSwap. This week has been quite busy with a lot of\ntesting from our closed beta group which has led to many non-insignificant\nimprovements and fixes being made to Particl's upcoming cross-chain and private\nDEX.\n\nLocalParticl.com\nAlthough not an update coming from the team, we want to give a shout-out to the\nLocalParticl.com team who's made yet another useful update to their Particl\nMarketplace web browser [https://ParticlMarketplace.shop] \n(ParticlMarketplace.shop) this week: the ability to subscribe to a listing (or a\nseller) and receive an email notification when a new question or comment is\nposted on its page.\n\nAs a matter of general interest, the LocalParticl.com team also provides three\ndifferent TorV3 nodes which can be used to securely route your connection\nthrough the Tor network.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you all for your support and valuable contributions, they are our infinite\nsource of motivation and are a big part of what keeps us going every day.\n\nStay tuned for next week as we'll publish our second team funding proposal and\nreveal our plans for the next 6 months, you're bound to like what you'll see ?\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend and we'll see you back on Monday! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information about what items\nare planned to be included in the next update in a follow-up blog post that will\nbe published to Particl News very shortly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This should assist with reducing fees slightly.</li><li>A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the sending of smsg.</li><li>The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it contains.</li><li>Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market service was starting up.</li><li>Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the product/template editor are now clearly displayed.

The ring size can still be edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default value used.</li><li>Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.</li><li>Fixes an issue in using a very high <code>inputs_per_sig</code> value on anon related transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.</li><li>Updates the <code>locked</code> balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc command <code>getlockedbalances</code> for this purpose.

Given\nthat we just passed Christmas time and that we are currently running a testnet\nround for Particl Desktop 3.1, this progress report will be a tad briefer than\nusual, so let's get down to it now.\n\nThis week, the focus has been on testing the Particl Desktop 3.1 testnet build\nand fixing a few minor issues with it, both related to the Particl Marketplace\napp and the wallet itself. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nMuch like we communicated in last week's progress report, it appears that no\nmajor bug, issue, or inconvenience that would delay the mainnet release has been\nidentified by either the team or community testers. \n\nA few minor issues have been identified and promptly fixed throughout the week,\nand there have been other minor improvements (i.e., back-end stealth address\ngeneration process) made to the 3.1 build which will be included in the mainnet\nrelease. We expect to release the new Particl Desktop update, on mainnet, in the\nearly days of January 2022.\n\n> Note: As for the items to be included in Particl Desktop 3.2, expect a blog post\npublished on Particl News very soon after the release of Particl Desktop 3.1 on\nmainnet. We'll detail our 3.2 roadmap and let you know what items are going to\nget the spotlight!\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, more extensive testing has been ongoing and minor improvements have\nbeen made to Particl's upcoming cross-chain and private DEX: BasicSwap. \n\nAs we near the completion of various test cases with the participants of the\nclosed beta group, and as the DEX's user interface is progressing well, we will\nsoon be ready to divulge more information about the launch of BasicSwap's open\nbeta (open to the public). However, we still, at this present time, cannot give\nan ETA on when it will be ready as we are working to ensure that it is as solid\nand secure as it should be.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd on that note, we wish you all a happy new year. We are highly confident that\nthe Year 2022 is going to be a breakthrough one for Particl. Not only have we\ngot the Particl V3 release out of the way in 2021, but we've also set the stage\nto release, in 2022, a brand new and groundbreaking application in BasicSwap.\nIndeed, the BasicSwap DEX is going to be instrumental in Particl's success and\nwill directly lead to more exposure and, more importantly, organic adoption. \n\nAs the Particl ecosystem expands in terms of utility and real-world use-cases,\nwe can't help but feel very positive about the path we've got ahead of all of\nus.\n\nAs always, thanks to every single one of you for your incredible support,\npassion, trust, and dedication to the Particl project and mission. Glorious days\nabound!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Fixes various typos, incorrect button labels, and incorrect text/label\n   related concerns.\n * Update to using core v0.21.\n\n> Note that for new users, a default wallet is not automatically created, and so\nthe initial wallet generation (when using the wallet module as the first entry\npoint) will allow for a wallet name to be provided.\n> The particl-core setting txindex will be explicitly enabled by automatically\nupdating the particl.conf file.\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Allow for backing up the market profile mnemonic and passphrase. These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information on the 3.2\ndeliverables as 3.1 goes live on mainnet.\n\nThanks for your time and help properly testing Particl Desktop 3.1; it ensures\neverything works as expected and speeds the mainnet deployment process. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These are generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.</li></ul><blockquote>Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so backing up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile are backed up as well.</blockquote><ul><li>Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.</li><li>Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the sender's machine.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search criteria under certain cases.</li><li>When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop receiving smsg for that market.</li><li>Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees slightly.</li><li>A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the sending of smsg.</li><li>The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it contains.</li><li>Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market service was starting up.</li><li>Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater visibility when a value is missing.</li><li>The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.</li><li>The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.</li><li>In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed) is shown alongside the refresh button.</li><li>Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).</li></ul><blockquote>Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes afterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to occur.</blockquote><ul><li>Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of items in the batch publish modal.</li><li>Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:</li></ul><blockquote>This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor) as well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for further details).<br><br>These values can be viewed in the listings detail window.<br><br>Do note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's details as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when non-standard escrow ratios are used.<br><br>Orders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any additional information that may be needed.</blockquote><ul><li>A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.</li><li>Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.</li></ul><h3 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h3><ul><li>Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.</li><li>Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored and for the user to regain access to their coins.</li><li>Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.</li><li>A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default value used.</li><li>Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.</li><li>Fixes an issue in using a very high <code class=\"language-text\">inputs_per_sig</code> value on anon related transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.</li><li>Updates the <code class=\"language-text\">locked</code> balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc command <code class=\"language-text\">getlockedbalances</code> for this purpose. The previous means attempted to calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong values.</li><li>Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview page).</li><li>Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative measure.</li><li>Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value. The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.</li><li>The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.</li></ul><blockquote>The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the initial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.</blockquote><ul><li>The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per transaction.</li></ul><hr><p>Particl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It improves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by introducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace vendors.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone” release, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial 3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a new dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information on the 3.2 deliverables as 3.1 goes live on mainnet.</p><p>Thanks for your time and help properly testing Particl Desktop 3.1; it ensures everything works as expected and speeds the mainnet deployment process. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

This blog\npost will let you know everything you need about the hardfork and about how to\nprepare ahead. Let’s jump in directly and look at the details more closely.\n\n> Note: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.18\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18] or greater if\nyou haven’t already done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will\nlead you to connect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other\npeople will not be relayed and you won't be earning staking rewards.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardfork Schedule\nIn the first place, Particl’s testnet will hardfork on the 1st of January 2022,\nat 17:00 UTC. This will provide the ability for everybody to ensure that\neverything goes as expected. \n\nThen, on the 1st of February 2022, at 17:00 UTC, Particl's mainnet network will\nhardfork.\n\nPrepare Ahead\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and ensure future functionality of\nyour Particl apps, you need to update your Particl Core node to the latest\nversion available [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]. \n\nOnce you've updated your node(s), you don't need to do anything; you'll\nautomatically fork to the right chain, along with the rest of the network, on\nthe 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC.\n\nThe update procedure differs depending on your environment.\n\nParticl Desktop\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, close it down completely and re-open it. The\nclient will update itself automatically. Look at the bottom left corner of your\nclient; the \"core\" version should display 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Partyman\nIf you are cold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, enter\nthis command to update your node.\n\ncd ~/partyman && ./partyman update\n\nVerify that the update went on as expected by executing this command.\n\n./partyman status\n\nThe displayed version should be version 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Core - QT Wallet\nWith a standalone Particl Core - QT wallet, you need to download and install the\nlatest version manually.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.18 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019218Hashes121365dec50e99eba4c25a2d7ff2a1e968949717bd0d8d6706c3f172fd596373\nparticl-0.19.2.18-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]Particl Copay\nIf you use the mobile Particl Copay wallet, then no user interaction is required\nfrom you. The core version will be updated automatically in time for the\nhardfork.\n\nPART Coins on Cold Staking Pools\nIf you stake coins on cold staking pools, then you don't need to do anything\nother than to ensure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with Particl\n0.19.2.18 or greater. \n\nHowever, you must be aware that if the pool you're staking on doesn't update\ntheir nodes in time for the hardfork, you'll be staking on the wrong chain and\nthus, won't be receiving rewards. For this reason, make sure the cold staking\npool you're staking on updates in time. You can usually do this by appending \n/version or /api/version at the end of the pool's URL (i.e., \nhttps://coldstakingpool.com/api/version). \n\nIf you are the operator of a pool, please follow these instructions\n[https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.md] to\nupdate your node.\n\nPART Coins on Exchanges\nWe have started reaching out to exchanges on which PART is available in\npreparation for this hardfork.\n\nAs is usual, no customer interaction is needed as exchanges manage their own\nnodes. However, make sure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with the latest\nversion of Particl Core.\n\nWhat’s New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings more privacy and smaller transaction fees to Particl\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], \nBasicSwap [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) and for a\nwide variety of transaction types.\n\nparticl-core/fork-notes.md at master · particl/particl-coreParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/master/doc/fork-notes.md#rct-bug-fix-fork-3]\nTaproot\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction.\n\nFixing listing fee adjustment feature\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower. \n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability has been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, once the fee target amount drops below\na certain point, the code won't allow it to change anymore (up or down). This\nhardfork fixes that issue by clamping the minimum amount it can change to 1 sat,\nmaking the feature functional and allowing stakers to adjust listing fees again.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThis hardfork will also re-enable a small number of disabled outputs from people\nwho’ve missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and\nhaven’t put up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the\nsteps mentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\nFailure to submit your claim before the hardfork will mean you’ll have to wait\nfor the next one. If you don’t have any disabled outputs, or simply don’t know\nwhat this is about, then you don’t need to do anything here.\n\n> Note: The deadline to submit your claim for this hardfork is on the 1st of\nJanuary 2022, at 17:00 UTC.\nReducing money supply when outputs are burned (for future use)\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis hardfork is an important one for the ecosystem, notably with the major\naddition of Taproot and the fix to the listing fee adjustment mechanism. \n\nWe recommend that you update your node(s) as soon as possible; failure to do so\nin time for the hardfork will result in you being on the wrong chain.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

So see you all on Monday! Oh, right, it's time for our\nweekly development update first! ?\n\nThis week, most of the focus has been on adding a few key improvements to the\nmarketplace and desktop client after receiving various feedback from the\ncommunity. While these fixes may seem mundane to some, they fix relatively\nencumbering issues that affect both buyers and sellers in different cases. A few\nexamples of these improvements will be given in the Particl Desktop progress\nreport section of this blog post.\n\nAdditionally, we mentioned last week that, due to the larger-than-expected scope\nof adding digital items delivery, we were evaluating whether we'd include that\nfeature in Particl Desktop 3.1 or not. After looking at the situation, we've\nopted not to include it. \n\nA big reason for this decision is that Particl Desktop 3.1 now includes a lot of\nimportant and quality-of-life fixes and improvements over the initial mainnet\nrelease of Particl V3. Delaying their release would be counter-productive and\nunnecessary. Indeed, some of these fixes are relatively critical for some users,\nand so we're prioritizing releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 faster so that these\nusers can benefit from the fixes and gain back a better user experience.\n\nWith that in mind, we've started planning ahead for the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 on testnet. We're finalizing the last few remaining items planned\nfor 3.1 and will then build a testnet client for community testing. We'll\ncommunicate more details on the testnet release in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nIn the intro of this progress report, we've mentioned that several improvements\nhave been added to Particl Desktop, notably relating to Particl Marketplace.\n\nFor example, we've added a shortcut in the Send/Convert page to split a\ntransaction into multiple outputs, which should make it more visible as well as\neasier to set on a transaction-per-transaction basis. This has been a\nmuch-requested improvement by some of our vendors as it previously caused them\nsome issues, especially concerning the process of publishing listings.\n\nAlso, if something goes wrong during a transaction and one party does not\nreceive an updated order status from the other party (which means their client\ndidn't properly pick up the intended SMSG message), that other party can now\nsimply press a button that's been added to the order flow which conveniently\nallows for their last action status to be rebroadcast. It was possible to do\njust that in the past, but it required commands to be entered manually in the\nconsole window; a less-than-ideal user experience. This isn't needed anymore and\ncan be accomplished with the simple click of a button.\n\nSimilar to the item above, another button has been added. This one rescans SMSG\nmessages (executes the smsgscanbuckets command) for you, so in the case where it\nmight appear that an SMSG message was unproperly received, you can just click on\nthat button so that your client tries to find and process the message.\n\nAnother small change that was added is the display of a count of new listings\nthat are not yet displayed in the market browser. Previously, an alert indicator\nwould be displayed over the refresh button; this is still there but now a count\nof how many new items have been received is also displayed near the refresh\nbutton.\n\nAside from these, a variety of bug fixes and general improvements have been\nadded, as is usual, making this week one that ended up being quite productive\nand helpful in improving the general user experience.\n\nWith all of that being said, here's the list of remaining items to be included\nin Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress and is expected to be\n   wrapped up next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above item is completed. It is expected to resume next\n   week or so and is also expected to be wrapped up relatively quickly.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). While this task has seen some progress since it was started, it will\n   not be included in Particl Desktop 3.1 and is pushed for later on. \n\nKeeping the listed items above in mind, we will be starting the process of\nbuilding and releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet very soon. \n\nAs always, we'd rather not give a precise date or estimate for its release, but\nwe hope to begin the process towards the end of next week. We'll give you more\naccurate details on this in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl's Core Developer, Tecnovert, has focused mostly on Particl\nCore and on preparing the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIndeed, Particl Core 0.21.2.5 has been pre-released a couple of days ago and you\ncan now download and install it by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.5].

This week has been one where we've focused on fixing a tricky issue with Particl Marketplace and have been exploring how best to release Particl Desktop 3.1.</p><p>Indeed, an issue was brought to our attention in which some listing messages are not being received by some markets. The problem seems to be related to two separate issues, but both can occur at the same time. Out of these two issues, one is already fixed but we are still busy investigating the second one especially as it seems to deal with the way the marketplace validates the incoming listing messages and, for some reason, appears to be working on some machines correctly but not on others. This makes tracking, and more importantly, testing the problematic code a little trickier than expected. We are looking into this and should have it fixed fairly soon.</p><p>As far as the progression regarding the delivery of digital items goes, there's been a number of stumbling blocks in getting this working properly. Indeed, it now appears that it will require significantly more time than expected since it touches on many more components of both Particl Desktop and the marketplace back-end code.</p><p>In other words, we cannot currently give any estimation yet on when this might be ready and, for this reason, we've begun exploring releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 without that feature. In fact, we do not want to drag the release of Particl Desktop 3.1 for too long. After releasing Particl V3 on mainnet, we've opted to go ahead with more frequent releases and we intend on sticking to that commitment. </p><p>That being said, even without digital items delivery being included in the next Particl Desktop update, we'll see the introduction of a few new features as well as a large number of bug/issue fixes and general improvements. Among them, we can count on the addition of a seller-adjustable escrow ratio and various important seller-focused improvements, notably many new options for importing inventories and editing, in bulk, listing prices. The vast majority of these additions have been suggested by Particl Marketplace sellers themselves and should fix some of the most obvious pain points for them.</p><p>As we are giving a final look at what is still required to add the digital items delivery feature, we'll let you know, in next week's progress report, whether we've decided to release V3.1 with or without it. </p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-progress-report\">Particl Desktop Progress Report</h2><ul><li>Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes, etc.). <strong>This task is in progress but is proving to be much more time-consuming than initially expected. </strong>For this reason, we may de-prioritize this task in favour of the other two and release Particl Desktop 3.1 without it<strong>.

It contains valuable information still\nvalid to this day regarding adjusting the listing fees of Particl Marketplace.\nPlease consult the table of contents to jump to the relevant section or click\nhere.\nOn the 12th of August 2019, the Particl Open Marketplace launched live on\nmainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-is-now-live-on-mainnet-bed75988b690]\n. This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving\nany data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the\neCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open\nMarketplace is still a Beta piece of software.\n\nThat means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for\nmass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means\nthis current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect\ntesting ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be\nimproved.\n\nIndeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the\ncommunity of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different\nperspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more\nquickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click me)\n * Dynamic Listing Fees\n * Why are Listing Fees Needed\n * High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\n * Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic Listing Fees\nOne of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of\nParticl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an\nitem or service up for sale. \n\nLuckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its\ncommunity of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true\nfor Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. \n\nFor this reason, it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees\nof the marketplace. It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk\nyou through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main\nimplications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That\nwill serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much\nyou want to change the listing fees of the network.\n\nWhy are Listing Fees Needed?\nThere are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing\nitems. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is\nthe ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very\nappealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.\n\nFighting Spam\nThe first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because\nthere is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any\nperson with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from\nspamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees\nto introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low\nend, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings,\nthen it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.\n\nThat’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the\nsame reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or\nParticl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized\nnetworks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no\nrecourse.\n\nKeeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date \nAnother lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to\nkeep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore.\nThat’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation\npowers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite\nproblematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for\na certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the\nseller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order.\nPretty annoying, right?\n\nHow listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on\ntwo factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc)\nand the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you\nset your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system\nworks in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a\nfinancial cost to its duration. \n\nTheoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then\nit is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of\nthe listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.\n\nIncentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network\nAnother important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the\nsecurity of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. \n\nIn fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to\nstakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards\nwill keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a\ngreater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the\nnetwork effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to\nspread the word around in an organic manner.\n\nHigh Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\nBefore you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is\nimportant to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some\narguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both\nperspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.\n\nLower fees\n * Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller\n * Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nHigher fees\n * More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the\n   marketplace and higher barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater\n * Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nIt’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller\nstaking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards \nper listing published, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on\nthe marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more\nindividual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.\n\nTutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\nSo you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but\ndon’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact,\nsince Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast\ntheir target listing fee to the network.\n\nA Community-Powered Tug-of-War\nOne staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he\nwants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community\nconsensus.\n\nListing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week\n(10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by\nstakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a\nconstant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the\nsmsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is\nstaked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee\ntargets broadcast by stakers. \n\nThe smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then,\nonce the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current\nsmsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th\nblock.\n\nThis can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war. Each staker broadcasts\nto the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace\n(higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards\nor downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers\nwant fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If\nthe majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget\nwill slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want\ndramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a\nmuch faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to\ntheir side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a\ndigital game of tug-of-war.\n\n> Note (01-12-2021): The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and\nimproved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee\ntarget at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.\nThe fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small\nincrements enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the\nprocess of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and\nunpredictable changes).\n\nPut the current value into perspective\nTo get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the\ncurrent market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into\nperspective.\n\nNote: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3\nimages per item and 1000 chars of text.\n\n# Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43\n\nIn the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100\nlistings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale\nwith Particl Marketplace.\n\nNow, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So,\nideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should\nget increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is\nneeded.\n\nBroadcast a Different Listing Fee Target\nThe way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're\ncurrently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two\nthings:\n\n * Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget\n * Broadcast your desired target to the network\n\nIf You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt\nIf you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet\n“unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is\npretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of\nsmsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. \n\nTo do so, simply open up the <console> and enter the smsggetfeerate command.\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nconsole window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns\nthe value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This\nis important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast\ndepending on your preference.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the\nfollowing command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target\nyou want to set.\n\nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nFor example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you\nwould put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then\nsimply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. \nNote that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.\n\n> Important: If you already have a custom stakingoptions parameter, like a custom \nrewardaddress, for example, then please enter the following command into the\n<console> and replace addr by the rewardaddress you set up previously: \nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nIf You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node\nIf you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need\nto broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. \n\nTo do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that\nyou can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and\nenter the following command:\n\n./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nterminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. \n\nAt the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255.\nThis means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to\nknow as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your\npreference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first\nupdate your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:\n\ncd partyman && git pull\n\n Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:\n\n./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget\n\nThis command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that\nyour node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a\nnew target or not. If you wish to do so, type y to move forward through the\nprocess. \n\nOnce that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your\ndesired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if\nyou would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the\nvalue at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the\nvalue at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve\nchosen and written your new target, press Enter to apply the change and start\nbroadcasting it to the network. Note that your desired value has to be 8\ndecimals or less.\n\nIf You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your\ndesired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking\nnode or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your\nliking.\n\nIf You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different\ntarget, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following \nthis link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md]\n.\n\nIf You’re Not Staking\nIf you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the\nnetwork. This is a golden opportunity for you to get started with staking and be\npart of Particl’s fully decentralized consensus-finding process. If you want to\nget started with cold staking, simply follow the steps available in this\nParticl\nAcademy tutorial\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/guides/guide_mp_general_enable_staking.html]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow you’re all set to start broadcasting your listing fee target rate to the\nnetwork. Take note that, at this time, the fee adjusting feature is not optimal\nand may result in negligible changes only. In the next hardfork (early 2022),\nthe feature will be significantly improved and made more effective. But it's\nnever too early to set up your node in the meantime!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

That’s because this value is attained through community consensus.</p><p>Listing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week (10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by stakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a constant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the smsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is staked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee targets broadcast by stakers. </p><p>The smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then, once the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current smsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th block.</p><p><strong>This can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war</strong>. Each staker broadcasts to the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace (higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards or downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to their side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees.

To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. </p><p>To do so, simply open up the &lt;console&gt; and enter the <code>smsggetfeerate</code> command.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image.png 1269w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the console window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns the value <code>23255</code>. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the following command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target you want to set.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}</code></pre><p>For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> If you already have a custom <em>stakingoptions</em> parameter, like a custom <em>rewardaddress</em>, for example, then please enter the following command into the &lt;console&gt; and replace <em>addr</em> by the <em>rewardaddress</em> you set up previously: </blockquote><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}</code></pre><h3 id=\"if-you-re-cold-staking-coins-on-a-staking-node\">If You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node</h3><p>If you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need to broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. </p><p>To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and enter the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate</code></pre><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the terminal.

The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first update your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd partyman &amp;&amp; git pull</code></pre><p> Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Adjusting-Listing-Fees/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>This command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that your node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code>y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve chosen and written your new target, press <code>Enter</code> to apply the change and start broadcasting it to the network. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your desired target.

This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving any data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the eCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open Marketplace is still a Beta piece of software.</p><p>That means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for mass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means this current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect testing ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be improved.</p><p>Indeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the community of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different perspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more quickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.</p><hr><h2 id=\"table-of-content-click-me-\">Table of Content (Click me)</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</h2><p>One of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of Particl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an item or service up for sale. </p><p>Luckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its community of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true for Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. </p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees of the marketplace.</strong> It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk you through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main implications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That will serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much you want to change the listing fees of the network.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed?</h2><p>There are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing items. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is the ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very appealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>The first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because there is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any person with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from spamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees to introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low end, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings, then it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.</p><p>That’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the same reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or Particl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized networks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no recourse.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-the-marketplace-content-up-to-date\">Keeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date </h3><p>Another lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to keep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore. That’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation powers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite problematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for a certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the seller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order. Pretty annoying, right?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image-4.png 1313w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>How listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on two factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc) and the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you set your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system works in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a financial cost to its duration. </p><p>Theoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then it is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of the listing.

To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. </p><p>To do so, simply open up the &#x3C;console> and enter the <code class=\"language-text\">smsggetfeerate</code> command.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image.png 1269w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the console window.

This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the following command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target you want to set.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"smsgfeeratetarget\"</span>:0.00000001<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div><p>For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325.

This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target.

It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve chosen and written your new target, press <code class=\"language-text\">Enter</code> to apply the change and start broadcasting it to the network. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your desired target.

for the weekly\ndevelopment update! \n\nThis week has been one where we haven't seen the completion of any specific\nitem, but where a lot of bug fixes, improvements, and tweaks have been made to\nthe code. \n\nNotably on the side of Particl Desktop, a few bug fixes have been made to the\n\"batch price update\" feature that lets sellers update the prices of their\nlistings in one step. As a reminder, this feature was heavily requested by some\nof the sellers that currently list multiple listings at once. Additionally, an\nimprovement has been made to the marketplace's search engine to prevent it, in\nsome cases, from displaying expired listings. Other than that, a few other\nmiscellaneous fixes have been included in the code, as is a usual occurrence. \n\nAt this time, the focus, concerning Particl Desktop, is on finishing up the\nalternative shipping option feature (the ability to provide another method of\ndelivery other than a physical shipping address). Because this requires multiple\nchanges to all components of the marketplace (Particl Desktop, Particl\nMarketplace, and the OMP Library), this is expected to last for the next week or\ntwo. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). This task is in progress and is the current primary focus.\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap DEX Progress Report\nThis week has been a bit trickier than usual when it comes to keeping the\nParticl blockchain codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest release. \n\nIn fact, Bitcoin has now swapped their abstraction of wtx state for another\nimplementation which has proven to be somewhat complicated, notably as it\nrelates to unabandoned stakes on Particl. This task is, however, complete as of\nright now.\n\nAs for BasicSwap, we've released, earlier today, a blog post\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/] on Particl News that\nexplains what it is, what it does, what makes it unique, and what's the bigger\nvision for it. This is a doozy of a blog post, so make sure not to skip on this\none! \n\nIntroducing Particl’s BasicSwap DEXThe upcoming fully private and decentralized\ncross-chain exchange for cryptocurrencies aspiring to set new standards.Particl\nNewscryptoguard [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]\nDevelopment-wise, a lot of testing, notably with failing scenarios (making swaps\nfail on purpose to try to break the DEX), has been ongoing. We are still happy\nto report that, as of today, and no matter how hard we try to break it, no\nfailed swap has resulted in any loss of funds. \n\nFinally, we're starting to look into activating Taproot on Particl Core. Because\nits activation will require a hardfork, we're looking into whether to include\nthat in the coming one or, instead, in a subsequent one. As there are a few\nimportant things to consider, we haven't yet settled down on a decision, but\nwill inform you as early as we can.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLocalParticl.com Update\nAlthough not an official update from the team, the guys over at LocalParticl.com\nhave come out with yet another sweet update to their web marketplace browser\n[https://particlmarketplace.shop/].\n\nWe're happy to relay that their web browser now allows you to browse different\nuser-generated markets and storefronts, not just the Open Market (default\nmarketplace). It also now benefits from a dark theme for those late-night owls\namong us! ?\n\nScreenshot of a listing on a user-generated storefront (LocalParticl.com's web\nbrowser)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the announcement of the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, Particl's long-term vision\nis starting to shape up nicely and it's now becoming clearer to see where the\nParticl ecosystem is headed. Nothing can stop the Particl train now, but know\nthat we've got even more planned further down the road!\n\nBig thanks to the guys at LocalParticl.com and the rest of the community for\nyour dedication, contributions, and passion for the Particl mission. We are\nblessed to have such a top-tier and ideology-driven community like you all!\n\nWe wish you all a great weekend, and we'll see you back on Monday!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It lets you make or take orders on a distributed\norder book and execute swaps that are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and\nprivate. To find out what makes it a one-of-a-kind DEX, keep on reading this\nblog post!\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeParticl’s\nupcoming DEX is powered by the atomic swap technology\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/a-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/] \nand the SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, making it entirely decentralized and devoid of any central operator. No KYC,\nno trickery, no false promises. Just pure decentralization and privacy. And yes,\nin case you were wondering, it is fully compatible with Monero (XMR) and will be\nright from the get-go! ?\n\nIn this blog post, we will take a deep look into this new Particl distributed\napplication. We’ll detail how it’s going to fit in as a critical component of\nthe Particl ecosystem and, perhaps even more importantly, ensure the personal\nfreedom and financial sovereignty of its users.\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Particl Ecosystem Explained\n * The BasicSwap DEX Explained\n * List of Compatible Coins\n * Key Features\n * Monetization\n * How Does it Compare?\n * Why is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\n * Open Beta Coming Soon\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem Explained\nThe first step to understanding the significance of BasicSwap’s upcoming release\nfor Particl is to get a good grasp of what the Particl ecosystem is.\n\nParticl Marketplace, accessible through Particl DesktopParticl is an ecosystem\nthat gives you the ability to live completely free by cutting off middlemen\nentirely. It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights,\nfreedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy\ndevelopment, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy\nthat people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other\nwords, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.\n\nIn many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of\n“decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key\nservices or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can\nalso see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is\nan ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any\nthird-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly\nimportant step towards that vision.\n\nIn fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially\nindependent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and\nunstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is\nrequired. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through\ncentralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While\ncentralized exchanges (i.e., Bittrex\n[https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART], WizardSwap\n[https://wizardswap.io/]) can provide many benefits and unique features, not\nhaving any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be\nuncompromisingly independent. But that’s all about to change!\n\nNow let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a\ncornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will\nbecome a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that\nend up on it.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX Explained\nKeeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely\nindependent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell\nor trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast,\nand decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to\ndo, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeBasicSwap\nis a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency\nfor another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. \n\nSwaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a\ndistributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is\ndecentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you\ncan check the code yourself!\n\nList of Compatible Coins\n * Bitcoin\n * Monero\n * Particl\n * Litecoin\n * Namecoin\n\nWe are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens,\nshortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled\ncryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing\nblockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may\nbecome available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration\nroadmap.\n\nKey Features\nBasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers\nmany benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing\nfeatures that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.\n\nDistributed Order Books\nBasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of\nswapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or\nPancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book\n(maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been\nplaced on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap\nmore akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading\non, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.\n\nNote that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s\norder book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of\ncentralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by\ndesign, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and\nthat's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s\nown P2P network, SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, which is the same network that powers Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].\n\nThe main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at\nthe exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more\ntraditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to\nsmart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of rug pulls\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/] and\nother theoretical exploits they carry.\n\nBut there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be\ndeployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being\nlooked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as\nsoon (™) as we can!\n\nTrue Cross-Chain Swaps\nParticl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other\nDEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one\nnative coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!\n\nYou can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e.,\nMonero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different\nEthereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require\ncoins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart\nChain, or other similar chains).\n\nThe World’s Most Private Trading Exchange\nTo top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well,\nit means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send\ndocuments, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary\nmaximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and\nwithout any care about who you are or where you live.\n\nThat’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become\nway too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively\nincrease your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins\nlike Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy\nbetween two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). \n\nIndeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you\nswap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (\nConfidentialTransactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation]),\nor anon (RingCT\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other\nprivacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).\n\nBut there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and\ndeploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style\ncurrencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other\nwords, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a\nBitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective\nblockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!\n\nIndeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta.\nThat's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable\nfunctionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!\n\nThe combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the\nworld’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will\nmake you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live\nfree...because, well, now you can!\n\nOther Interesting Features\nThere are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap\nwill become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected\nto grow gradually.\n\n * True Monero support\n * No account, sign up, or KYC\n * Incredibly low and competitive fees\n * User-friendly interface\n * No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point\n * Taproot compatible\n * Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)\n\nWhat About Monetization?\nAs BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from\nswaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we\nabsolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will\ncause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that\nthe DEX was the missing piece all along.\n\nIndeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for\nusing the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the\nentire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the\nDEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or\nused as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely\nto be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy\njust yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.\n\nIn other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as\nmore people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the\nPART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your\nstaking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on\nthe Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).\n\nKeep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little\nfriction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive\nwith industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.\n\nHow Does it Compare\nWe know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and\ndecentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and\noffers something quite unique.\n\nIn the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from\nother trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some\nof the other solutions around.\n\nBittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.  Compared to centralized exchanges... \n\nYou control your keys at any point in time You don't have to create an account\nor submit any document You don't need to verify yourself (KYC) There's no upper\nlimit as to how much you can trade per period of time You remain private every\nstep of the way There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at\nall \n\nUniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.  Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools… \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want Swaps are truly cross-chain; no wrapped token\nrequired (i.e., wBTC) Providing liquidity is done in a more traditional way\nusing order books (as opposed to liquidity pools) There's no rug to pull (read\nmore about the infamous rug pulls here\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/]) \n\nBISQ  Compared to the BISQ exchange... \n\nThe process of swapping is entirely decentralized and done between two people No\nsecurity deposit or escrow intermediary required Fees are lower Swaps are atomic\nby nature, you can’t be scammed or tricked by bad actors \n\nCOMIT  Compared to the COMIT network... \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want You can swap a vast selection of cryptocurrencies;\nit’s not exclusively Monero-centric Uses the SMSG network to safely execute\nswaps All options and steps are available from a user interface \n\nWhy is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\nUtility Impact on Particl\nThe most obvious reason for BasicSwap to be is to provide the Particl ecosystem\nwith an independent, autonomous, and private way to swap, buy, and sell the\nnative currency of the platform (PART) for as many other cryptocurrencies as\npossible.\n\nEarly mockup of a BasicSwap integration into Particl Desktop | Work-in-progress\nthat is subject to changeRelying on centralized exchanges and partners can\nprovide useful solutions and avenues to trade PART, but it makes the entire\necosystem dependent on them which is an unbearable risk. With BasicSwap, Particl\nbecomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of\nthe project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl\npermanently unstoppable!\n\nPromoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty\nAt this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies\nyield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon\nbillions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both\ncentralized and decentralized.\n\nFurthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish\nto impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life,\ncentralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more\nand more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of\ntrading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to\naccentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a\nParticl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting\nthousands if not millions of users, daily.\n\nWith this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows\ndarker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By\ngiving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to\nanother, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows\npeople to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.\n\nAs a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or\nrestrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you\nare, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s\nentirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to\nattract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from\nthis audience.\n\nExposure for the Project\nBecause of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all\ninterconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start\nusing other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to\naccentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop.\nAfter all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains\nas well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you\ndo (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).\n\nFor this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms\nof communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as\na complement to the marketplace.\n\nThat being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for\nParticl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions\nworth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of\nfeatures is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.\n\nIndeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation,\nreleasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a\nmajor bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the\ngood word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community,\nit’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new\nproduct other than the marketplace!\n\nEasier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace\nAll payments on Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] are\nprivate. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to\nuse it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT\nprivacy state (click here to learn more\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications]\n) are located.\n\nAnd because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.)\nwork using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires\nnew users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from\ntheir public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a\nsignificant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a\nsimple solution to that problem.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of\nyour choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for\nexample, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready)\nbalances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART\nusing your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to\nuse the marketplace right away!\n\nIncreasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards\nAs you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit\nthe entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is\nset in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand\nfor PART, reduce its circulating supply (burning coins), and introduce\nincentives for providing liquidity.\n\nOf course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as\npossible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also\nimportant to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to\nuse, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what\nmonetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!\n\nWhen is the Open Beta Going Live?\nCurrently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for\nseveral months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just\nabout to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we\nexpect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year\npresent to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be\nconsidered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.\n\nWhat to Expect From the Open Beta?\nBy any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will\nstill very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough\nexperience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name\nimplies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX\nand to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast\nselection of environments and situations.\n\nHere are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.\n\n * Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins\n * Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More\n   coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full\n   release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the\n   number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a\n   bigger focus.\n * You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions.\n   There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but\n   rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify\n   onboarding as much as possible.\n * A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at\n   least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups\n   that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test\n   the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more\n   advanced types of users.\n * You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap\n   (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on\n   taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.\n * As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t\n   worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy\n   to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we\n   (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap\n   that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that\n   it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather\n   than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!\n\nOf course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend\non revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the\nlifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!\n\nWhat’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?\nAs we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few\nitems that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as\nan insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several\nmonths now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta\nrelease.\n\n * More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and\n   installation process.\n * Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.\n * Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.\n\nOnce these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open\nBeta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will\ngo live.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and\nstrongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and\nsuccess of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major\nplay towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The\nbenefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further\nthan simply being helpful for the Particl community.\n\nAs such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post,\nbut we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the\ninfamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?\n\nSo, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update\neither in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development\nprogress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        </br>\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, /glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible.

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

weekly development\nprogress report. This week, we've got some exciting new feature to announce\nwhich is going to be part of the upcoming Particl Desktop update (3.1). And\nnobody expected it this soon! ?\n\nIndeed, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer initially started the week\nfocusing on adding alternative delivery methods for digital items. Upon looking\nat the code, he stumbled onto something interesting.\n\nIf you recall correctly, one of the current roadmap items is the ability to\nadjust the value of the escrow security deposit. It is also one of the top\nrequests we've received both from vendors and non-vendors following the release\nof Particl V3 on mainnet. As it turns out, due to the new, improved codebase\nintroduced by Particl V3, adding this feature ended up being a relatively easy\nand quick task to do.\n\nAs a result, we are happy to confirm that the \"adjustable escrow\" roadmap item\nis now complete and merged into the Particl Desktop code, meaning that it'll be\nactivated on the very next update (3.1). \n\nAt this time, custom ratios (0% to 100% of the value of the item being\npurchased) can only be decided by the seller at the time of creating a listing.\nTo ensure unaware users aren't met with bad surprises, any listing containing\ncustom ratios will clearly indicate it, and buyers will be forced to manually\ncheck a box confirming that they are aware of the custom ratios before checking\nout their cart.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Preview (UI WIP)Now let's have a look at the progress made on\nthe other items.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nBecause the majority of the week has been spent on integrating the adjustable\nescrow feature, the previously stated Particl Desktop \"to-do\" list has remained\nmore or less the same, with a few minor exceptions.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once\n   is now completed. The addition of a product code and the ability to import\n   images directly through the CSV file directly is still in progress, however,\n   we're now moving these two tasks for AFTER the completion of the enabling of\n   digital items. Both of these items are relatively easy to wrap up and we'd\n   rather focus on the more complicated task first.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has\n   been started this week and will be the primary focus for next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n\nParticl Core Progress Report\nThis week on Core, work has gone towards keeping Particl Core up-to-date with\nBitcoin's codebase. As always, you can track the progress by looking into the \nlist of commits on the Github repository\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. It provides valuable\ninsights into what's being done on that side of things. \n\nTo that end, a new Particl Core release (Particl Core 0.19.2.17\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.17]) has been\npublished and is now marked as a full release. You can download it here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.17] and consult\nthe list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019217]\n.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.17 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019217Hashes109cc332e88da32d94ca94dfc401568bde323992a29b13a3afc7274d2d7c7422\nparticl-0.19.2.17-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.17]Additionally,\ndevelopment on BasicSwap has continued as is now usual. As we've made\nsignificant progress in the past few weeks, you can now expect an introductory \nblog post on BasicSwap to go live by next week, so stay tuned to learn all the\nrelevant details about this upcoming major Particl application! \n\nLocalParticl Launches Market Web Browser\nAlthough this item hasn't been developed by the Particl team, it absolutely\ndeserves a spot in this development update. In fact, this week, the guys at\nLocalParticl.com released yet another awesome Particl product; a web browser\nthat lets you explore what's for sale on Particl Marketplace\n[https://particlmarketplace.shop].\n\nUsing your favorite web browser, you can now discover the many items and\nservices currently for sale on the Open Market (Particl Marketplace's default\nmarket).

So, without further ado, the time for the weekly\nstatus report has come. This week has been a continuation of the work reported\nin the past few progress reports. \n\nOn the side of Particl Desktop, there's not much new stuff that stands out other\nthan the previously mentioned items seeing some progress. As usual, a few minor\nbugs and improvements, as reported by community members, have been fixed and\nwill be included in the next version of Particl Desktop (3.1). Thanks to all of\nour dedicated community members that are still reporting issues and making\nsuggestions to this day; it's incredibly useful and has a big impact on the\nquality of the product!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nHere's a short list of the current items being worked on or planned on being\nworked on in the short term. \n\nPlease note that these items are part of the immediate priority the team has set\nup following the release of Particl V3 on mainnet. They are meant to support the\nmainnet release by making its foundation better. While they may appear minor,\nthey are vital to different types of users and will go a long way in making\nParticl Marketplace more usable in the immediate.\n\nAny new major feature or function is planned for Particl Desktop 3.2 and\nsubsequent versions.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once\n   is mostly completed, with only UI tweaks and additional testing being\n   required. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file directly is still in progress and is expected\n   to be wrapped up next week, if all goes well. \n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nParticl's core developer, Tecnovert, has spent the vast majority of the week\ntesting the upcoming BasicSwap DEX and fixing various small issues. We are happy\nto report that the protocol is now pretty stable but still requires testing as\nthe upcoming open beta will be over mainnet (meaning you'll be able to swap\n\"real coins\"). That's why it needs to be as secure as possible and cater to any\npotential weird case.\n\nOn that note, the GUI for the open beta is currently under work and will be\nmoved as a top priority starting on Monday next week. Please keep in mind that\nthe GUI for the open beta is not at all how we intend it to be on the date of\nthe official release; it's merely so that you can test the bare protocol is a\nmore user-friendly way.\n\nWe've mentioned it in the past, but it's worth repeating; we've got many\nsurprises planned for BasicSwap and have a big strategic vision for it. While we\nhaven't released too much information about it, or on how we plan on leveraging\nit to make Particl go viral, but we do not want to play our cards too early for\nmany reasons.\n\nAs we make solid progress on the upcoming DEX every week and check more and more\nitems off of its to-do list, we near its official announcement and the reveal of\nmuch key information regarding it. We can't wait to share those with you and\nwe're absolutely thrilled with the direction it's taking. Stay tuned for more\ninformation, it's coming shortly!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks everybody for your support and passion.

We've\nopted to create a specific section for it named \"Progress\" and available on the\nnavigation bar at the top of this page. This reduces the bloat on the start page\nand makes it easier to follow the course of events that surround Particl. Follow\nthe link here [https://particl.news/tag/progress/] to get all the progress\nreports. \n\nNow let's get to the interesting part!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nA good portion of the week has been spent on improving SMSG messages propagation\nand handling from Particl Desktop to fix an outstanding issue that caused\nproblems for some users. A change was made to the marketplace handling of the\nresponse from core regarding sent messages; instead of failing only when a\nspecific failure case is met, it should now fail for everything unless it meets\nspecific success criteria. Although the fix still requires more testing, it's\nlikely that the issue is fixed by now. A few other reported issues are being\nlooked into, as is usual.\n\nAside from that, progress has continued over the previously-stated items,\ngradually leading up to the Particl Desktop 3.1 version.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. This\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task has been marked with\n   notable progress this week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nParticl Core and Other Development Progress\nThis week on the Core side of things, a lot of merges and updates have gone into\nParticl Core and the SMSG network. Notably, some investigation and work have\ngone towards looking into reducing marketplace listing fees, which should go\ninto effect in a future hardfork. As always, you can track Particl Core\ndevelopments by checking out the Github repository here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core].\n\nAdditionally, BasicSwap has received a lot of focus this week with breakthrough\nachievements being reached. Stay tuned for more details soon!\n\nMarketplace Listing Seeding Proposal\nFinally, there have been a few questions regarding the fully-funded Listing\nSeeding Proposal and its development status. We can confirm that the proposal is\nindeed under development at this present time, but as mentioned in the proposal,\nit is being done mostly outside of Particl's regular work scope. It's also being\ndeveloped in a private capacity.\n\nSince publishing the proposal, several iterations have been explored and the\nproject has evolved into a more important undertaking. While we do not want to\nconfirm any final structure at this moment, we are working towards making the\nsystem more open ended-instead of limited to the members who initially published\nthe proposal.\n\nIndeed, we are heavily considering making the \"listing seeding system\" usable by\nany community member looking to populate the marketplace with listings and\nmanage them from a web interface.\n\nAs a final note on this subject, it's important to be aware that this proposal\nis now dependent on a few upcoming items, notably the SMSG Controller roadmap\nitem. Additionally, while not a hard requirement, it would highly benefit from\nSMSG 2.0 which, if you remember, is expected to dramatically increase the\nscalability of Particl apps and services.\n\nFrom now on, we will include development updates for this proposal, when there\nis any to mention, in the weekly progress reports such as this one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and thank you all for your incredible support and\npassion for the project's mission.

This\nweek, we've made important progress and have been improving both Particl Desktop\nand the marketplace with a few bug fixes and tweaks to the code.\n\nNotably, we can report that the migration of Particl Desktop from Particl Core\nversion 0.19x to 0.21 is now complete. Although there has been a fair amount of\ntesting already, the team is looking to test it out more to ensure no issue\narises (as you can remember, Particl Core 0.21 introduced many changes that\ntouch on several aspects of the marketplace) before pushing it live. However, we\ncan confirm that Particl Core 0.21x will be the core version of Particl Desktop\n3.1.\n\nOther than that, a good portion of this week's focus has gone towards fixing a\nfew bugs and implementing improvements to both the desktop client and the\nmarketplace. Among these, we improved on the code that displayed the number of\nPART \"locked\" on Particl Desktop. In some cases, the indicated amount was simply\ninaccurate, leading to some users (in rare cases) seeing more \"locked\" coins\nthan they even owned in the first place. This was merely a display bug and has\nbeen fixed.\n\nFinally, another minor display issue has been improved. When converting funds\nfrom one type to another (i.e., public to anon), the Overview page only\ndisplayed the fee paid for the conversion instead of what amount was converted.\nThis is now fixed and will go live in the next version of Particl Desktop.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nThe list of outstanding tasks remains the same as last week's, with one item now\nbeing complete (migrating to Particl Core 0.21). As mentioned in the\nintroduction of this progress report, a lot of the work has gone towards fixing\nsome bugs and integrating improvements to both Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace.\n\nAs soon as the OMP Library bug is fixed, development will resume on these items:\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This task is now complete. \n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. This\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nToday, we want to provide additional information regarding the \"ability to\nupdate pricing via the batch publish window\".\n\nThis new feature, or rather, an improvement to the batch re-publish feature, is\na way for sellers to quickly batch update their listing prices without having to\nchange them one by one. This is particularly useful for sellers with many\nlistings who want to limit their exposure to PART price volatility.\n\nThis new feature is intended to work as follows, with potential changes being\nmade while it's being coded in (aka, functions not set in stone yet):\n\n * In the batch re-publish window, display the current prices per individual\n   product.\n * Display the \"new\" prices per product that the seller wants to set.\n * Include a global percentage modifier; setting this increments each product's\n   price by the percentage specified by the seller (i.e., putting 20% means all\n   listings have their prices increased by 20%).\n * Include an option per product to specify an exact price change rather than\n   using a global percentage modifier.\n * Include an option to override the global pricing modifier if the seller has\n   one or two items that had a drastic price change outside of the global\n   percentage change. It is also helpful if the seller wants to leave most\n   prices and set a percentage change on a few items only.\n\nAlthough this feature is still a work-in-progress subject to changes, this is\nhow the feature is currently being designed. It will help large sellers\nsignificantly reduce the time required to update their prices and better protect\nthem against PART price volatility. This is a temporary solution until a more\nfleshed-out solution is deployed (stable payments, as mentioned in the most\nrecent roadmap [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/]).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nParticl Core hasn't been much of a focus this week. Instead, Particl's core\ndeveloper, Tecnovert, has focused on developing a new surprise feature for\nBasicSwap; Particl's upcoming cross-chain and private decentralized exchange\n(DEX).\n\nThis feature hasn't yet been announced, whether publicly or even within the\nclosed beta group, and we're reserving its announcement for when we publish the\nofficial BasicSwap introductory blog post.\n\nSpeaking of which, this introductory blog post is the next major announcement\nscheduled for Particl. Keep an eye out on Particl News for this significant\nannouncement; we'll reveal all the details related to BasicSwap and how we\nintend on making it a crucial aspect of the entire Particl ecosystem.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the recent milestones we've reached together, namely the release of Particl\nV3 on mainnet, the new roadmap, and the website, and also with the upcoming\nmajor release of the BasicSwap open beta, the project is setting a rock-solid\nfoundation for the future of the internet. And even though, at times, the\njourney Particl has chosen to take may seem arduous and challenging, the rewards\nat the end of it are enormous.\n\nIndeed, far from being a \"for the money\" project, Particl is building the future\nof the digital world and strives to create a safe environment without middlemen;\na world that is all about individual freedoms and putting a stop to the reckless\nmining and abuse of your data. With everything it's doing, Particl is in the\nprocess of restoring the balance of power back to the people and away from\ngreedy corporations and agenda-driven organizations.\n\nThank you all for being a part of this important journey and believing firmly in\nthe project's mission. You are today's pioneers for a better tomorrow!\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend, and we'll see you on Monday!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Follow this link to discover the new front page of the\nParticl project: https://particl.io/\n\nParticl.io - Apps that respect your rightsCut off the middleman and live free\nwith apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy. A world of\nopportunities awaits you!Particl.io - Apps that respect your rights\n[https://particl.io/]Why a New Website?\nParticl is a mission-driven project with strong convictions. It is supported by\nincredibly talented developers who’ve built a unique and innovative\ndecentralized platform that finally shifts the balance of power back into the\nhands of the people, not greedy corporations.

That made it\nmore challenging to turn these interested people into new users and fans of the\nproject and limited the impact of any marketing, PR, or outreach effort.\n\nThat's why Particl needed a new website, especially now with the release of\nParticl V3 which pushes the project into a new phase where outreach will be more\nprevalent.\n\nThe Objectives Behind it\nThe website has been built with two simple but clear objectives in mind.\n\n- Showcase Particl’s products and their benefits\n\n- Tell Particl’s story and its mission.\n\nBuilding the website according to these two objectives ensures that the big\npicture becomes apparent and that people understand the purpose of the project,\nwhat it's working to achieve, and what they can get from it.\n\nAfter all, the official website is where new people land when they want to learn\nmore about a project. It’s what they use to make their first impression and\ndecide whether they want to dig deeper or skip the project out of a lack of\ninterest. And with so many projects to look at nowadays and the sheer number of\ndistractions screaming for attention, you have to transmit your message as\nclearly and concisely as possible if you want people to stick around and be\ninterested in digging deeper.\n\nA Website in Expansion\nParticl’s new website is expected to continue expanding and evolving as we move\nforward in time, especially as the upcoming Particl DEX (BasicSwap) soon enters\nits open beta phase. You can track its progress by following the Particl.io\nrepository [https://github.com/particl/particl.io] on Github.\n\nThe Cornerstone of All Upcoming Marketing Efforts\nThe website is where most marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns redirect people\nto. It has to be able to convert curious or interested people into new users of\nfans of the project. After all, that's where these people will be forming their\nfirst impression on the project.\n\nFor this reason, it’s easy to understand why the website is the cornerstone of\nmarketing. It is the key to capitalizing on successful initiatives and turning\npotentially interested people into real users and supporters.\n\nTo that effect, we've published, last week, the team's vision and short to\nmid-term plans for marketing here on Particl News.
