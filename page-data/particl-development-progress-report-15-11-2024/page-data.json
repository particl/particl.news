This valuable community contribution strengthens BasicSwap's\ndecentralized approach and represents another significant step toward achieving\nour mission.\n\nBasicSwap Codebase Improvements ✅\nAlong with today's large array of commits that have been added to the dev \nbranch, we've included a number of general codebase improvements and code\nclean-ups.\n\nNotably, we've resolved an issue with Monero wallets which should resolve a\nlong-standing issue that made BasicSwap become slower the longer you had been\nrunning your instance. This fix is a combination of BasicSwap improvements and\naccompanying fixes that have been published as pull requests to Monero earlier\ntoday (1 [https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9571], 2\n[https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9570]).\n\nOther updates, committed on November 15th\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev], include:\n\n * Large code formatting update, including tests (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555]\n   , 2\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/7b03ce476997ceee5f6b227c8a1b028175ed5b74]\n   )\n * Allow setting reserve below increment for market making script (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/373525b364249c493cc4dbd90fcfd62c38f009ff]\n   )\n * basicswap-prepare: don't start daemon if coin config exists in basicswap.json\n   (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/6be9a14335ac5b7893b231fd33983462bf90a93c]\n   )\n * Bypass Tor for .local domains (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b484827c15fdc306a9dc8b6ce52117371142dcc0]\n   )\n * Fix error when txid is unknown (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/51c11793265045edce7239372748dc74cfea2664]\n   )\n * Fix unbound error when no wallet data is cached (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b5f6eb65262fed1b731003b8248e34db57a32b45]\n   )\n * Adjust wallet name for Particl anon and blind interfaces (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/e28d41ed0caf4c3c28e6fbbf4d3385b48f7f38d6]\n   )\n * Add display_name to chainparams (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/00d70f8cc72096f6f132d108a453d0512ad22c47]\n   )\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWhile we have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer as\nreported last week, we've chosen to focus this week's front-end efforts on\nBasicSwap GUI updates.

However, we want to clarify that this\ninstaller is simply a tool to facilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on\nWindows.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nAutomated Marketplace Content Moderation ?\nDecentralized Moderation Meets Local AIDiscover the new automated, LLM-powered\nParticl Marketplace moderation script.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]Earlier today, we\npublished the open-source code for the automated, LLM-powered Particl\nMarketplace content moderation script. \n\nThis helper script, which aims to streamline marketplace moderation by shifting\nthe moderation burden from end-users to more engaged community members (though\nend-users can still participate in content moderate as before), is built using\nPython and is available across Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms.\n\nFor detailed insights into the system's architecture, check out our latest blog\npost here [https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]. Ready\nto get started? The setup guide is available in our Github README here\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script/blob/master/README.md]\n.\n\nWe encourage you to try this new proactive moderation approach and share your\nfeedback. We're particularly excited about how this solution bridges two\ntransformative technologies - cryptocurrencies and LLMs - to address the complex\nchallenge of unbiased content moderation in decentralized systems.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nWe've continued assisting mainnet-pat with his Bitcoin Cash integration into\nBasicSwap, notably focusing on a few edge cases and the \"mercy path\". \n\nYou can keep track of some of the development on that end by monitoring\nTecnovert's fork of BasicSwap (here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/bch_staging/]), which serves as\na testing ground for features and updates that will later on make it to the\nofficial BasicSwap repository.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWe have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer following\nextensive testing this week. However, we haven't been able to release it just\nyet, though we expect it to go live very shortly.\n\nFor context, we've adopted a new approach to the setup wizard that simplifies\nits flow and handles the installation process differently. This redesign aims to\nreduce potential failures that can occur across various Windows configurations.\n\nNew Display Type for Orders ?\nAs part of BasicSwap's current development cycle, we're reimagining the order\nbook display by introducing a new visualization option for available offers.\n\nWhile continuing to source data from the same network offers, the new interface\nwill more closely resemble traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. It will feature\na depth chart and a structured order book that displays both buy and sell offers\nin ascending order on opposite sides.\n\nThis enhancement aims to align BasicSwap's user experience with conventional\ntrading platforms, bridging the gap between atomic swap technology's benefits\nand the accessibility needed to achieve widespread adoption.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1855017656576839694]Don't miss our upcoming\nPrivacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX and Firo this coming\n20th of November at 9:00 AM EST!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
