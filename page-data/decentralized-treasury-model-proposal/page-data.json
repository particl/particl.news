This legal\nentity has served the purpose of funding the development and management of\nParticl as well as supporting the project legally using funds that it raised\nfrom the community in 2017.\n\nAs of November 2020, after slightly more than three years, the Particl\nFoundation has run out of the funds it raised from community donations and as\nsuch, has initiated its shutdown process. A mandatory closure audit is currently\nunderway.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team has since then voluntarily supported the project\nsince no funds are available anymore to pay for salaries, expenses, and fund\ndevelopment and initiatives.\n\nWith today's fast-paced and rapidly evolving blockchain industry, any serious\nproject needs to have enough funding to support its ecosystem, promote its\nproduct(s), and grow its community. Equally important is the necessity to have\nlegal representation so that the project can effectively and safely interact\nwith other parties, manage funds, and own assets (i.e., servers). Without any of\nthis, projects expose themselves to being overrun by competitors who don’t have\nthe same financial struggles.\n\nTo address this critical issue, the Particl team has consulted with a few\nadvisors and community leaders and put together a proposal for a new \ndecentralized treasury model that, if approved by the Particl community, could \nbring enough funding to self-sustain the project at current prices, boost\ncommunity resources, and provide a brand new legal entity to support the project\n.\n\nThis blog post will explain, in full detail, every aspect of the new\ndecentralized treasury model; how it works, its benefits and its parameters.\nThis is a first step aimed at getting you familiarized with the proposed idea.\n\nThen, in a separate blog post that will be published in the next few days on\nParticl News, we will publish a full breakdown of how the Particl team intends\nto claim and use those funds, restructure the project, stimulate the community\nand bring the Particl ecosystem to the next level in all aspects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Proposal in Short\n * Proposal Approval and Treasury Governance\n * Funding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\n * Additional Benefits\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposal in Short\nThis decentralized treasury model proposal, which is closely modelled after that\nof successful projects such as Siacoin and Decred, aims at firing up and\nexpanding Particl into a stronger-than-ever ecosystem by generating more PART\nthat can be put to use to the benefit of the project. The Particl team would\nthen claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or\nbi-annually.\n\nTo preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the\nintroduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community\nthrough an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to\ncome. If approved, the modifications necessary to activate the new treasury\nmodel will be included in the upcoming hardfork that re-enables RingCT and CT\ntransactions.\n\nSelf-Sustainability—The Numbers in Detail\n * Circulating supply post-hardfork (estimate): ~11,750,000 PART\n * Proposed yearly inflation rate: 8%\n * Proposed treasury block rewards: 50%\n * Proposed total yearly staking rate (APR for stakers): 4%\n * Proposed yearly treasury rewards (estimates): 470,000 PART\n * Monthly treasury rewards (averaged from estimates): 39,166 PART\n\n> Note: If the proposal is approed, the current 10% “development staking reward”\nis going to be abolished in profit of the new decentralized treasury model.\nIn summary, the proposal for this new decentralized treasury model suggests\nincreasing the yearly inflation rate from 2% to 8% for two years and then \ndecreasing it by 1% every two years until it reaches 6% and stays at that level.\nEvery time the network stakes a block, 50% of the block rewards would then be\nredistributed to stakers and 50% into the Treasury Fund to fund, support,\npromote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating\nsupply every year.\n\nThis brings the yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%. Because\nAPY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY\nalways ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, if 50% of all\nthe PART coins are staking on the network, the staking APY goes from 4% to\naround 8% yearly.\n\nThis proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it\nprovides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core\nteam, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at\ncurrent (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to\nexpand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More\ndetails on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim\nand use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few\ndays on Particl News.\n\nDuring its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an average of 39,166 PART\nevery month. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to\nsustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next\nlevel. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.\n\nOf course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in\nthe trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable\nin fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs,\nstimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the\nentire ecosystem even more. For this reason, the Treasury Fund has exponential\ngrowth potential, but it's also important to note that a reduction in the price\nof PART can also have an adverse effect.\n\nProposal Approval and Treasury Governance\nThe Particl team has long been looking to decentralize the project further and\nput more power into the hands of the community. That’s the true spirit of\nblockchain technology, after all, and this is precisely what this new\ndecentralized treasury model achieves.\n\nAs such, this new treasury model is being suggested as a CCS proposal and\nrequires community approval to be set in motion. If the vote passes and the\nproposal is approved, the new treasury model will be put in place in the\nupcoming hardfork.\n\nAs for the governance of the Treasury Fund itself, you, the community, will have\nthe final say over it. To claim funds from it, the Particl team will publish CCS\nproposals every quarter or on a bi-annual basis, depending on a few factors at\nthe time the proposals are published. These proposals will detail how the funds\nare intended to be used, the objectives for the claim period, and what to expect\nin terms of deliverables.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the Particl team will publish shortly a\nseparate blog post exclusively focused on explaining how it will be restructured\nin light of this new decentralized governance (including a brand new legal\nentity), how it intends to claim and use funds moving forward, as well as its\nobjectives and deliverables.\n\nCommunity Governance and On-Chain Voting\nTo approve CCS proposals and claims of funds, the community will be invited to\nvote through the on-chain voting mechanism built into Particl Core. This voting\nsystem uses staking weight, meaning the number of coins being staked, as voting\ntickets. The more coins you stake on the Particl network, the greater your voice\nin these voting events.\n\nIt is possible to vote using clients such as Particl CLI, Particl Desktop, and\nParticl-Qt, but the best way to do it is through Particl’s cold staking\napplication Partyman. To facilitate the process of voting, a GUI integration has\nbeen added to the CCS, effectively tying proposals to on-chain voting events.\n\nMore information about the on-chain voting system, including the consensus and\nquorum requirements, will also be published in a separate blog post focused on\nthe on-chain voting scheduled for in a few days on Particl News.\n\nFunding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\nThe implementation of the treasury model, combined with the on-chain voting\nsystem integration into the CCS, will also enable brand-new opportunities at the\ncommunity level. Every month, a number of PART coins coming from the\ndecentralized treasury fund will be sent into a community-governed fund.\n\nThis Community Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM], which\nalready contains ~25,818 PART coins as a result of unclaimed PART during the\ncoin swap event in 2017, will be made available to the community to be used to\nfund CCS initiatives. For an initiative to be funded by the Community Fund, it\nneeds to first go through a voting process, reach a voting quorum (minimum\nnumber of coins having voted), and approval rate. If that is achieved, then the\nproposal is officially approved by the community. According to the milestone\nschedule, the correct number of coins will be sent from the Community Fund to\nthe initiative’s custodian.\n\nAdditional Benefits\nWhile this blog post simply exclusively intends on explaining the decentralized\ntreasury model proposal, here are some of the benefits it will provide to the\nproject if approved. Of course, much more information on that end will be\npublished in the blog post that will explain how the team intends on using those\nfunds coming in just a few days.\n\n * Complete restructuring of the team’s internal processes, management,\n   leadership, and communications (internal and external).\n * Team expansion as price and market situation permits.\n * More active and rapid development as well as a more constant release\n   schedule.\n * More regular, streamlined, and transparent communication/updates.\n * More active, engaged, and blooming community and ecosystem.\n * More focus on deliverables other than Particl Core, the marketplace, and\n   Particl Desktop.\n * Renewed efforts in getting listed on more prominent exchanges.\n * More financial and human resources to market Particl’s products (i.e. PART\n   coin, Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, etc.)\n * Many more promotional and user acquisition initiatives.\n * And more…\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the power\nto significantly change things around and give the project the spark it needs to\nget the exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce behind it that it\ndeserves.\n\nAs we finally move ahead with a lot of what's been in the works for the last\nweeks, keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS this week and the next one.\nWe will start publishing lots of new content including follow-up blog posts and\nthe CCS proposals. We invite you to take part in the discussion related to these\nproposals in their respective comment section on the CCS as they get published.\n\nLet’s get this proposal approved, and let’s take Particl to a whole new level!\n\n> The Particl team\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The Particl team would then claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or bi-annually.</p><p>To preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the introduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community through an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to come.

Every time the network stakes a block,<strong> 50% of the block rewards</strong> would then be redistributed to stakers and <strong>50% into the Treasury Fund</strong> to fund, support, promote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating supply every year.</p><p>This brings the <strong>yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%</strong>. Because APY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY always ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, <strong>if 50%</strong> of all the PART coins are staking on the network, the <strong>staking</strong> <strong>APY goes from 4% to around 8% yearly</strong>.</p><p>This proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it provides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core team, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at current (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to expand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More details on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim and use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few days on Particl News.</p><p>During its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an <strong>average of 39,166 PART every month</strong>. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to sustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next level. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.</p><p>Of course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in the trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable in fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs, stimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the entire ecosystem even more. For this reason, the Treasury Fund has exponential growth potential, but it's also important to note that a reduction in the price of PART can also have an adverse effect.</p><h1 id=\"proposal-approval-and-treasury-governance\"><strong>Proposal Approval and Treasury Governance</strong></h1><p>The Particl team has long been looking to decentralize the project further and put more power into the hands of the community. That’s the true spirit of blockchain technology, after all, and this is precisely what this new decentralized treasury model achieves.</p><p>As such, this new treasury model is being suggested as a CCS proposal and requires community approval to be set in motion. If the vote passes and the proposal is approved, the new treasury model will be put in place in the upcoming hardfork.</p><p>As for the governance of the Treasury Fund itself, you, the community, will have the final say over it. To claim funds from it, the Particl team will publish CCS proposals every quarter or on a bi-annual basis, depending on a few factors at the time the proposals are published. These proposals will detail how the funds are intended to be used, the objectives for the claim period, and what to expect in terms of deliverables.</p><p>As mentioned earlier in this blog post, the Particl team will publish shortly a separate blog post exclusively focused on explaining how it will be restructured in light of this new decentralized governance (including a brand new legal entity), how it intends to claim and use funds moving forward, as well as its objectives and deliverables.</p><h3 id=\"community-governance-and-on-chain-voting\"><strong>Community Governance and On-Chain Voting</strong></h3><p>To approve CCS proposals and claims of funds, the community will be invited to vote through the on-chain voting mechanism built into Particl Core. <strong>This voting system uses staking weight</strong>, meaning the number of coins being staked, as voting tickets. The more coins you stake on the Particl network, the greater your voice in these voting events.</p><p>It is possible to vote using clients such as Particl CLI, Particl Desktop, and Particl-Qt, but the best way to do it is through Particl’s cold staking application Partyman. To facilitate the process of voting,<strong> a GUI integration has been added to the CCS</strong>, effectively tying proposals to on-chain voting events.</p><p>More information about the on-chain voting system, including the consensus and quorum requirements, will also be published in a separate blog post focused on the on-chain voting scheduled for in a few days on Particl News.</p><h2 id=\"funding-ccs-initiatives-with-a-community-fund\">Funding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund</h2><p>The implementation of the treasury model, combined with the on-chain voting system integration into the CCS, will also enable brand-new opportunities at the community level. <strong>Every month, a number of PART coins coming from the decentralized treasury fund will be sent into a community-governed fund.</strong></p><p>This <strong><a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\">Community Fund</a></strong>, which already contains <strong>~25,818 PART</strong> coins as a result of unclaimed PART during the coin swap event in 2017, will be made available to the community to be used to fund CCS initiatives. For an initiative to be funded by the Community Fund, it needs to first go through a voting process, reach a voting quorum (minimum number of coins having voted), and approval rate. If that is achieved, then the proposal is officially approved by the community. According to the milestone schedule, the correct number of coins will be sent from the Community Fund to the initiative’s custodian.</p><h1 id=\"additional-benefits\"><strong>Additional Benefits</strong></h1><p>While this blog post simply exclusively intends on explaining the decentralized treasury model proposal, here are some of the benefits it will provide to the project if approved.

Core 0.19.2.6 and \nParticl Desktop 2.3.6. These releases aim to ease and streamline the process of\nidentifying anon and blind outputs to assist the team in selecting the best path\nforward and help reveal exploited outputs that can then be blacklisted.\n\nBelow this post, you’ll find a detailed progress report for Particl V3. If you\nwant to jump straight to it, you can click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 and Particl Core 0.19.2.6\nRelease Particl Desktop v2.3.6 · particl/particl-desktopThis patch release\nincludes some minor usability enhancements.NB!! The source code linked to here\nis not the actual tagged release source code. Please contact Particl for source\ncode information. ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6] * Desktop\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\n * Core\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 introduces a new GUI tool to quickly identify the anon and\nblind outputs from all your unlocked wallets. It uses the new Particl Core\n0.19.2.6 release, which improves the output tracing script.\n\nTo see the complete list of changes for Particl Core 0.19.2.6, follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/branch_0.19.2.6/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01926]\n.\n\nTo use the new tool, simply follow these steps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1- Open Particl Desktop 2.3.6 and ensure you are running Particl Core 0.19.2.6.\n\n2- Unlock all of your wallets by opening each of them in the bar on the left and\nclicking the lock pad icon at the top right corner of the client.\n\n3- Once all your wallets are unlocked, click on the printer icon at the top\nright corner of the client and a new window will appear.\n\n4- Choose where you want to export your output data, and then click on the \nExport button.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter clicking the Export button, a file named frozen_blinded_data.txt will be\ncreated in the location of your choice. To submit this file to the Particl team,\nsend it to Tecnovert (@tecnovert:matrix.org) on Riot/Element or to Cryptoguard \neither on Telegram/Riot/Element/Discord or by email at cryptoguard@particl.io.\n\nThank you for participating in this output submission process; it will help the\nteam select the best path forward to re-enable frozen outputs and blacklist\nexploited ones!\n\n> Note: Running Particl Desktop 2.3.6 will automatically update your Particl Core\nnode to the latest version. You shouldn’t need to download the new Particl Core\nversion separately unless you want to collect your outputs without using Particl\nDesktop.\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nWe are happy today to also provide a detailed Particl V3 progress report. This\nlist contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last\nParticl V3 progress report.\n\nAdditionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of\nParticl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved.\nThe development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.\n\nTo-Do\nA list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet.\nSome of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the\nothers are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some\nWindows users.\n\n * Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any\n   related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product\n   templates for the market cannot be created, etc. The fix has been implemented\n   and is currently in testing phase.\n * An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically\n   removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. The fix has\n   been implemented and is currently in testing phase.\n * A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing\n   the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the\n   “shipping step”. The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing\n   phase.\n * Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace\n   does not work as expected. The fix has been implemented and is currently in\n   testing phase.\n * The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the\n   implementation of selecting a category during the product template\n   creation/editing.\n * Fix the zmq.node error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.\n * Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the\n   user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are\n   some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better\n   solution can be implemented.\n * Add dynamic loading screen quotations.\n * There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.\n * Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the\n   category creation process after creating a new storefront market.\n * Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no\n   confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if\n   the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is\n   promoted.\n\nIn Progress\nA list of items currently being worked on.\n\n * Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API\n   improvements applied in particl-market. Needs some significant testing to\n   ensure all things are working, so takes a non-trivial amount of time to\n   complete.\n * In the wallet module, the Address label is not clearly indicated that it\n   requires additional action (clicking the button) to save the label.\n * Test Particl Core 0.19.2.6 with Particl Desktop 3.0, fixing any issues that\n   may occur.\n\nCompleted\nA list of the items that have been completed since the last Particl V3 progress\nreport.\n\n * Add 32-bit Windows builds back in as before.\n * Setting all shipping costs to 0 causes some errors while publishing a product\n   and purchasing.\n * On the listings page, add a checkbox-like control to each item to avoid\n   confusion about unselecting a selected country.\n * Allow for the transaction ID to be selected/copied in the Transaction table.\n * Ensure the 'Show inactive and archived' checkbox in the Orders pages is\n   checked/enabled by default to prevent orders from seemingly disappearing once\n   they are complete.\n * Fixed an error that appeared when the Particl Desktop application is closed\n   while the marketplace is starting.\n * A menu dropdown with no additional identities for selection now indicates no\n   alternative identities for selection (rather than displaying nothing).\n * Presents a missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when creating a market with an\n   encrypted wallet/identity.\n * Display an alternative error message when accepting a bid fails due to having\n   insufficient available funds.\n * Swap the position of the public and anon balance values in the Market\n   Overview display.\n * Updated a setting description to describe its intended purpose more\n   accurately.\n\nETA\nDue to the recent inflationary bug, all anon and blind outputs are temporarily\nfrozen. And because the Particl Marketplace works using anon and blind outputs,\nit is not operational until the upcoming hardfork that unfreezes outputs occurs.\n\nFor this reason, a mainnet release of Particl V3 is not possible until the\nhardfork. In the meantime, you can expect one or more testnet releases of\nParticl V3 to properly test all the new bug fixes and improvements made to it\nsince the first testnet release.\n\nIf the mainnet release is entirely ready before the hardfork takes place, the\nteam will start working on additional Particl Desktop deliverables/features in a\nseparate branch which may, or may not, be merged in time for the first V3\nmainnet release. If a feature has been started and is not ready for release when\nthe hardfork takes place, it’ll then be included in a subsequent release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last Particl V3 progress report.</p><p>Additionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of Particl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved. The development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.</p><h3 id=\"to-do\">To-Do</h3><p>A list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet. Some of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the others are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some Windows users.</p><ul><li>Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product templates for the market cannot be created, etc. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the “shipping step”. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace does not work as expected.<strong> The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the implementation of selecting a category during the product template creation/editing.</li><li>Fix the <code class=\"language-text\">zmq.node</code> error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.</li><li>Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better solution can be implemented.</li><li>Add dynamic loading screen quotations.</li><li>There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.</li><li>Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the category creation process after creating a new storefront market.</li><li>Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is promoted.</li></ul><h3 id=\"in-progress\">In Progress</h3><p>A list of items currently being worked on.</p><ul><li>Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API improvements applied in particl-market. Needs some significant testing to ensure all things are working, so takes a non-trivial amount of time to complete.</li><li>In the wallet module, the Address label is not clearly indicated that it requires additional action (clicking the button) to save the label.</li><li>Test Particl Core 0.19.2.6 with Particl Desktop 3.0, fixing any issues that may occur.</li></ul><h3 id=\"completed\">Completed</h3><p>A list of the items that have been completed since the last Particl V3 progress report.</p><ul><li>Add 32-bit Windows builds back in as before.</li><li>Setting all shipping costs to 0 causes some errors while publishing a product and purchasing.</li><li>On the listings page, add a checkbox-like control to each item to avoid confusion about unselecting a selected country.</li><li>Allow for the transaction ID to be selected/copied in the Transaction table.</li><li>Ensure the 'Show inactive and archived' checkbox in the Orders pages is checked/enabled by default to prevent orders from seemingly disappearing once they are complete.</li><li>Fixed an error that appeared when the Particl Desktop application is closed while the marketplace is starting.</li><li>A menu dropdown with no additional identities for selection now indicates no alternative identities for selection (rather than displaying nothing).</li><li>Presents a missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when creating a market with an encrypted wallet/identity.</li><li>Display an alternative error message when accepting a bid fails due to having insufficient available funds.</li><li>Swap the position of the public and anon balance values in the Market Overview display.</li><li>Updated a setting description to describe its intended purpose more accurately.</li></ul><h3 id=\"eta\">ETA</h3><p>Due to the recent inflationary bug, all anon and blind outputs are temporarily frozen. And because the Particl Marketplace works using anon and blind outputs, it is not operational until the upcoming hardfork that unfreezes outputs occurs.</p><p>For this reason, a mainnet release of Particl V3 is not possible until the hardfork. In the meantime, you can expect one or more testnet releases of Particl V3 to properly test all the new bug fixes and improvements made to it since the first testnet release.</p><p>If the mainnet release is entirely ready before the hardfork takes place, the team will start working on additional Particl Desktop deliverables/features in a separate branch which may, or may not, be merged in time for the first V3 mainnet release. If a feature has been started and is not ready for release when the hardfork takes place, it’ll then be included in a subsequent release.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

The hardfork fixed the issue and temporarily froze anon\nand blind outputs so that exploited ones couldn’t be used anymore.\n\nToday’s post will provide all the details on the way forward post-bug, including\nthe roadmap to closure, the process of re-enabling legitimate outputs,\nestimates, how to help the team out, and more.\n\nThis is a rather important blog post so make sure you read it carefully.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content\n * Current Figures and Estimations\n * How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\n * Supply and Staking Implications\n   [/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/supply-and-staking-implications]\n * The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\n * Help the Team Gather More Information\n * AMA for Any Remaining Questions\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Figures and Estimations\nAt this moment, it is confirmed that 768,767 PART coins have been successfully\nexploited and transferred back to public balances\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. This number can be\nconfirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting\nfigure with the expected supply.\n\nFor clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held\nin public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of\ncoins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected\nsupply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all\nthe coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value\nwhen entering the gettxoutsetinfo command.\n\nBut the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing\nto Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total\nnumber of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to\nit. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into\naccount public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to\nbe sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of\nexploited coins up as it happens.\n\nIn this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have\nbeen already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be\nconfirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs.\nThis brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 +\n768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to\nbe in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at\n11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).\n\nOf course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of\nre-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure\nshouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.\n\nHow to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\nOn the March 2021 Project Update\n[https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], we mentioned two different\ntechniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins.\nSince then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved\nthe solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put\nonto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows\ncarefully.\n\nLow Pass Filter\nThe easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass\nfilter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that\nwill trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most\nmarketplace-related anon and blind outputs.\n\nThis low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low\nnumber of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass\nfilter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or\nless will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low\npass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors\nbefore the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.\n\nThis is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs\nqualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next\nhardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your\nParticl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.\n\nIf you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to\nfirst transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new\npost-fork anon address.\n\nManual Claim Process\nIf you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go\nthrough a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the \nMarch 2021 Project Update [https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], the\nteam has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with\na more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the\nprocess.\n\nInitially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to\nre-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power\nover the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the\ncommunity.\n\nWe now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process\nthese claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process,\nthe Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking\nfor the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.\n\nIf approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure\nchannel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client.\nThis script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step\nuntil it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump\nthe privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by\nrecreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary.\nAdditional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully\nvalidate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in\nthe great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected\ndata. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an\ninstant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.\n\nIf a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his\ncase to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated\nby the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a\nseparate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with\nanother hardfork later on in the future.\n\nThis improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce\nthe burden put on the user, and increase privacy.\n\n> Note: Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a\nseparate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.\nSupply and Staking Implications\nBecause this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the\ncurrent expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix\nthat issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different\nfactors.\n\n 1. On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum\n    of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total\n    of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be\n    raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.\n 2. The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which\n    is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has\n    already been confirmed in the initial vulnerability disclosure\n    [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. That sums up to a\n    total of 768,767 coins.\n 3. The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins\n    are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are\n    re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same\n    amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and\n    1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute\n    maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass\n    filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART\n    coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the\n    filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and\n    small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs\n    also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because\n    they have already been flagged as fraudulent.\n\nDue to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl\nblockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.\n\nThe Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\nThe coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and\nallow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes\nlive, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled\nand both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl\nV3 to go live on mainnet.\n\nThere are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go\nlive. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then. Each item is\nmore or less in chronological order.\n\nFinalize and Test the Tracer Script\nParticl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on the “tracer script” which,\nwhen executed in a Particl client, will automatically validate the legitimacy of\nmany frozen outputs by tracing anon outputs back to public ones.\n\nThe script is currently being finalized and incrementally tested with outputs\nthat have already been provided to the team by a couple of community members.\n\nVote to Nominate the Team as Claim Managers\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the team will soon be pushing a proposal\nto the CCS system to be nominated as managers of the claim process. If approved\nby the community, users will be able to submit their proof directly to the team\ninstead of pushing independent proposals. If the team rejects a claim, the user\nwill still be able to plead his case to the community by making a CCS proposal\nof his own.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice for discussion and to give enough time for people to become aware of\nit.\nProcess Manual Claims and Compile the Whitelist\nAfter the team’s proposal is approved, claims will need to be collected and\nvalidated. All claims that get approved will be added to a whitelist which will\nautomatically re-enable validated outputs once the next hardfork goes live.\n\nVote On the New Treasury Model and Implement It\nAs a final item before the next hardfork will go live, the team will push a\nsecond proposal to activate the new treasury model. This new treasury model will\nbring funding to the team and allow the Particl project to be back at full\nforce.\n\nIf approved, the team will include the changes (which are relatively simple to\ninclude all things considered) into the code and activate the new treasury model\nwith the next hardfork.\n\nExpect a standalone blog post about this new proposed treasury model on Particl\nNews within the next few days.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice. The proposal will be published after the first week of the voting\nperiod to nominate the team as claim managers so that both voting periods can be\ncompleted as quickly as possible for the hardfork to go through.\nAt this time, we are looking for the hardfork to go live in around 6 weeks.\nThat’s the time required for both votes to go through and for everything to be\nready. If they are both approved, then the hardfork will re-enable frozen\noutputs and activate the new treasury model at the same time. The team also\nhopes that it can release the Particl V3 mainnet release simultaneously,\nalthough that remains to be seen. As always, this is an estimate based on the\ninformation currently available. We will communicate to the community if any\ndelay occurs.\n\nHelp the Team Gather More Information\n> UPDATE: You can now more easily collect your outputs simply by downloading and\ninstalling Particl Desktop 2.3.6\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6]. In this\nclient, you'll find a \"printer\" icon at the top right of your screen with a\nsimple button to automate steps 1 to 6 in the following section.\nTo improve the tracer script and flag as many exploited outputs as possible, the\nteam is looking to gather as much information as it can. To help the team out on\nthat quest, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has put together a series of\ncommands you can enter in any of your wallets that has ever had an anon/blind\nbalance or transaction.\n\n1- Download the latest pre-release of Particl Core (Qt) here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2].\n\nRelease 0.19.2.6 Alpha 2 · tecnovert/particl-coreTo downgrade to a previous\nrelease, run debugwallet {\\“downgrade_wallets\\”:true} from the later\nrelease.Hashes668c254e9a0e7d4521d53868ece2691a520f6b2c86976aebdbb6e3b2a5d743ee\nparticl-0.19.2.6-aa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2]2- Load all your wallets that have or have had anon transactions and/or frozen\noutputs.\n\n3- Open the debug console located in the \"Window\" tab at the top of the wallet.\n\n4- Don't forget to switch your debug console window to the wallet with anon\ntransactions/outputs.

You’ll be able to ask any questions related to it and\non how the team will proceed. This thread will then double up as an FAQ thread\nfor people with similar questions and be linked directly into the CCS proposal.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and patience throughout this delicate situation.

This number can be confirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting figure with the expected supply.</p><p>For clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held in public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of coins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected supply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all the coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value when entering the <code>gettxoutsetinfo</code> command.</p><p>But the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing to Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total number of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to it. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into account public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to be sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of exploited coins up as it happens.</p><p>In this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have been already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be confirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs. This brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 + 768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to be in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at 11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).</p><p>Of course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of re-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure shouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-reactivate-legitimate-outputs\">How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs</h1><p>On the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, we mentioned two different techniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins. Since then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved the solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put onto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows carefully.</p><h3 id=\"low-pass-filter\">Low Pass Filter</h3><p>The easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass filter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that will trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most marketplace-related anon and blind outputs.</p><p>This low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low number of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass filter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or less will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low pass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors before the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.</p><p>This is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs qualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next hardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your Particl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.</p><p>If you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to first transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new post-fork anon address.</p><h3 id=\"manual-claim-process\">Manual Claim Process</h3><p>If you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go through a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, the team has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with a more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the process.</p><p>Initially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to re-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power over the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the community.</p><p>We now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process these claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process, the Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking for the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.</p><p>If approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure channel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client. This script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step until it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump the privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by recreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary. Additional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully validate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in the great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected data. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an instant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.</p><p>If a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his case to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated by the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a separate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with another hardfork later on in the future.</p><p>This improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce the burden put on the user, and increase privacy.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a separate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"supply-and-staking-implications\">Supply and Staking Implications</h1><p>Because this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the current expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix that issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different factors.</p><ol><li>On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.</li><li>The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has already been confirmed in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/\"><strong>initial vulnerability disclosure</strong></a>. That sums up to a total of 768,767 coins.</li><li>The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and 1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because they have already been flagged as fraudulent.</li></ol><p>Due to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl blockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.</p><h1 id=\"the-roadmap-to-the-coming-hardfork\">The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork</h1><p>The coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and allow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes live, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled and both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl V3 to go live on mainnet.</p><p>There are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go live. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then. Each item is more or less in chronological order.</p><h3 id=\"finalize-and-test-the-tracer-script\">Finalize and Test the Tracer Script</h3><p>Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on the “tracer script” which, when executed in a Particl client, will automatically validate the legitimacy of many frozen outputs by tracing anon outputs back to public ones.</p><p>The script is currently being finalized and incrementally tested with outputs that have already been provided to the team by a couple of community members.</p><h3 id=\"vote-to-nominate-the-team-as-claim-managers\">Vote to Nominate the Team as Claim Managers</h3><p>As mentioned earlier in this blog post, the team will soon be pushing a proposal to the CCS system to be nominated as managers of the claim process. If approved by the community, users will be able to submit their proof directly to the team instead of pushing independent proposals. If the team rejects a claim, the user will still be able to plead his case to the community by making a CCS proposal of his own.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of pre-notice for discussion and to give enough time for people to become aware of it.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"process-manual-claims-and-compile-the-whitelist\">Process Manual Claims and Compile the Whitelist</h3><p>After the team’s proposal is approved, claims will need to be collected and validated. All claims that get approved will be added to a whitelist which will automatically re-enable validated outputs once the next hardfork goes live.</p><h3 id=\"vote-on-the-new-treasury-model-and-implement-it\">Vote On the New Treasury Model and Implement It</h3><p>As a final item before the next hardfork will go live, the team will push a second proposal to activate the new treasury model. This new treasury model will bring funding to the team and allow the Particl project to be back at full force.</p><p>If approved, the team will include the changes (which are relatively simple to include all things considered) into the code and activate the new treasury model with the next hardfork.</p><p>Expect a standalone blog post about this new proposed treasury model on Particl News within the next few days.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of pre-notice. The proposal will be published after the first week of the voting period to nominate the team as claim managers so that both voting periods can be completed as quickly as possible for the hardfork to go through.</em></blockquote><p>At this time, we are looking for the hardfork to go live in around 6 weeks. That’s the time required for both votes to go through and for everything to be ready. If they are both approved, then the hardfork will re-enable frozen outputs and activate the new treasury model at the same time. The team also hopes that it can release the Particl V3 mainnet release simultaneously, although that remains to be seen. As always, this is an estimate based on the information currently available. We will communicate to the community if any delay occurs.</p><h1 id=\"help-the-team-gather-more-information\">Help the Team Gather More Information</h1><blockquote><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> You can now more easily collect your outputs simply by downloading and installing <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\">Particl Desktop 2.3.6</a></strong>.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
