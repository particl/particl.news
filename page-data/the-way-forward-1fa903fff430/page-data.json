This isn’t early crypto anymore when innovative projects were\nrewarded with exposure and growth simply based on development accomplishments.\nIn reality, what the blockchain community is still looking for, even after all\nthese years, is the metaphorical “killer app”, that first blockchain product\nthat will significantly improve on something concrete and bring the masses on\nboard. In other words, it is looking for blockchain to cause a paradigm shift.\n\nIn fact, the crypto community has more or less “seen it all”, especially\nconsidering the large number of projects that have fundraised millions of\ndollars based on bold promises but haven’t delivered a single thing yet. And\neven those projects that have delivered live blockchain products have seen very\nlittle adoption from anyone outside the few crypto hobbyists. The reason for\nthat is actually pretty simple — crypto’s “killer app” is still missing and\nnowhere to be found.\n\n“Isn’t Particl THE Killer App”?\nWith that in mind, many within Particl’s community would be fast to point out\nthat Particl’s Open Marketplace is just that — crypto’s killer app. After all,\nit offers a LOT of benefits that simply cannot, by design, be offered by the\nmore traditional online marketplaces currently in existence…and that’s all\nthanks to blockchain and distributed technologies. It charges no commission and \nbarely any fee at all, is inherently private by default, provably secures your\ndata by completely getting rid of third-parties, requires no sign-up, no login, \nno personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works\nfrom anywhere in the world as long as you can connect to the internet. In fewer\nwords, it completely redefines the very nature of eCommerce by taking it through\nthe evolutionary path and making it much better. And that simply wouldn’t be\npossible without blockchain and the other novel distributed technologies\nemployed by the Particl platform.\n\nSo why isn’t Particl getting more adoption? Why isn’t Particl the new hot\nmarketplace on the web? To understand why that is, it is important to look at it\nfrom a different perspective, one that’s not coming from a hardcore\ncryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nThis is precisely what this article is going to breakdown. What are the\nmarketplace’s current pain points? What are some of its obstacles to adoption\nstill standing to this day? How can these be fixed or eliminated so that any\neffort towards user adoption starts yielding positive results? Get prepared,\nbecause this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new\ndevelopment roadmap. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning\nbehind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving\nforward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?\nWarning Banner Header on Particl DesktopBefore getting into the finer details,\nwe first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace\nis still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its\ntesting/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s\ntrue even though it is currently running on mainnet.\n\nWhile Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out\nthere, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live\nblockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final\nversion. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case,\nthink in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real\nchallenge.\n\nThat, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption\ncompared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still\ndefinitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers.\nOnly once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant\nincrease in the levels of adoption.\n\nBut the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace\nadoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix\nwhat makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start\nreaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka\nthe number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.\n\nWhat are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?\nThe first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand\nwhat’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s\nmissing? To that end, the Particl team has recently received a feedback report\nfrom a very prominent crypto company\n[https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7] \nwhich ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl\nteam itself.\n\nAs it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different\ncategories:\n\n * Missing features\n\nBecause Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way \nfeature complete [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete]. That means a\nlot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be\ntools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make\nbetter-informed purchasing decisions, etc.\n\nAnd while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important\ndevelopment phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing\nthe base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl\nwas first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load\nof very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure\nof the marketplace the same way Market Management will.\n\nAnd even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they\nprobably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us\nto the second category…\n\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n\nReleasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it\nneeds to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major\nrefactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet\non the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to\nsignificantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and\nwill also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you\nlearn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of\nParticl’s marketplace components…\n\nAs time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features\nand functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released,\nis called “refactoring [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]”. Code\nrefactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch\ncomponents also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make\nsure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a\nbig pile of spaghetti code [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code].\n\nBut more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already\nout or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they\nbecome user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different\nphases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding\nmore functionalities and efficiency in following updates.\n\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n\nSometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are\nnot directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be\nthe whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these\nchanges are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it\ndefinitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general\nimprovements.\n\nThose improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what\nmakes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes\nloading times shorter, etc.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex\nto be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready\nto market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be\nappropriately integrated and feel right before it can be considered as ready.\n\nConsidering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web,\nand also because most people access those with pretty decent internet\nconnections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both\nsellers and buyers now more than ever. Even more so, users will generally be\nwilling to spend a little more if it means simpler and more pleasant user\nexperience. Which leads us to the fourth and final category…\n\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\n“UI/UX is everything”, or so… Referring to the previous statement, “users will\ngenerally be willing to spend a little more if it means a simpler and more\npleasant user experience”.\n\nOf course, UI/UX is not the only thing that matters, but it is what glues\neverything together so that it makes sense and just feels right. You can have\nall the features in the world, but if they are displayed confusingly or\nunpleasantly, people will generally not even bother. That becomes even truer as\na product’s learning curve gets steeper.\n\nThe reason behind this is mostly due to time constraints and the over-saturation\nof options available to users. Especially in the case of marketplaces — there\nare hundreds, if not thousands of them. Even if a marketplace’s value\nproposition is significant, it’s pretty hard to change people’s habits and get\nthem to move from a marketplace they know and feel comfortable using to one that\nis complicated to understand and doesn’t look as good (it’s pretty fair to\nsay…looks do matter).\n\nSo, is Particl’s Open Marketplace complicated to use? The answer might be “no”\nto you, but be assured it’s probably a resounding “YES” for most people you\nknow. So how do you make these people leap forward and into this new age for\nonline marketplaces? You gotta make sure that each of these 4 categories is\nbeing taken care of by the development team and bring the marketplace to a point\nthat it may finally be considered “adoption-ready”.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, Let’s Tackle Those Issues!\nNow that we know where lies the adoption hurdles for Particl’s Open Marketplace,\nit’s now time to strategize and plan around those. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a brand new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond. With adoption in\nmind, each of the roadmap items has been carefully selected to eliminate what\nwould make people not want to use the marketplace. There is one specific reason\nbehind each of these items.\n\nIt’s important to understand, though, that the 4 categories mentioned above are\ntightly intertwined. For example, you can’t spend too much time on UI/UX when\nthe marketplace may still significantly change structure as it will with the\nintegration of Market Management. But you should still do a little, as long as\nyou keep development hours wastes at a minimum. This is why Particl’s\ndevelopment team is focusing on these 4 categories as the underlying line of\nthinking behind the new roadmap’s content.\n\nThe Time to Reveal the New Roadmap is NOW ?\nYes indeed, the time to reveal the new roadmap has arrived! We now know just \nhow\nmuch has been done in 2019\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], how far has\nthe marketplace has progressed since releasing on mainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02],\nand what are the reasons it’s not been getting more adoption up until now. We\nare now equipped with all the tools to fully understand the reasoning behind the\nitems included in the new roadmap.\n\nWith that being said, you can safely expect the new roadmap to be revealed next\nweek, with its full and detailed breakdown being published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news].\n\nAs Market Management comes out in the next few weeks and with the new roadmap\ngiving a clear indication of the way forward for the project, the entire Particl\nteam is more than excited for what lies ahead of us all.

This isn’t early crypto anymore when innovative projects were rewarded with exposure and growth simply based on development accomplishments.

It charges <strong>no commission </strong>and <strong>barely any fee at all</strong>, is inherently <strong>private by default</strong>, <strong>provably secures your data</strong> by completely <strong>getting rid of third-parties</strong>, requires <strong>no sign-up</strong>, <strong>no login</strong>, <strong>no personal or business information</strong>, is <strong>censorship-proof</strong>, <strong>free to use</strong>, and <strong>works from anywhere in the world</strong> as long as you can connect to the internet. In fewer words, it completely redefines the very nature of eCommerce by taking it through the evolutionary path and making it much better. And that simply wouldn’t be possible without blockchain and the other novel distributed technologies employed by the Particl platform.</p><p>So why isn’t Particl getting more adoption? Why isn’t Particl the new hot marketplace on the web? To understand why that is, it is important to look at it from a different perspective, one that’s not coming from a hardcore cryptocurrency enthusiast.</p><p>This is precisely what this article is going to breakdown. What are the marketplace’s current pain points? What are some of its obstacles to adoption still standing to this day? How can these be fixed or eliminated so that any effort towards user adoption starts yielding positive results? Get prepared, because <strong>this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new development roadmap</strong>. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning behind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving forward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-the-marketplace-s-current-stage-of-development\">What’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Way-Forward/1-1pWgQdPqD1Tgk3FBk2oKQw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Warning Banner Header on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>Before getting into the finer details, we first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace is still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its testing/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s true even though it is currently running on mainnet.</p><p>While Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out there, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live blockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final version. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case, think in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real challenge.</p><p>That, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption compared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still definitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers. Only once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant increase in the levels of adoption.</p><p>But the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace adoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix what makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start reaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka the number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-marketplace-s-current-pain-points\">What are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?</h2><p>The first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand what’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s missing? To that end, <a href=\"https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7\"><strong>the Particl team has recently received a feedback report from a very prominent crypto company</strong></a> which ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl team itself.</p><p>As it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li></ul><p>Because Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete\"><strong>feature complete</strong></a>. That means a lot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be tools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make better-informed purchasing decisions, etc.</p><p>And while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important development phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing the base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl was first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load of very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure of the marketplace the same way Market Management will.</p><p>And even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they probably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us to the second category…</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li></ul><p>Releasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it needs to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major refactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet on the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to significantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and will also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you learn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of Particl’s marketplace components…</p><p>As time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features and functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released, is called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\"><strong>refactoring</strong></a>”. Code refactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch components also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make sure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a big pile of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code\"><strong>spaghetti code</strong></a>.</p><p>But more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already out or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they become user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different phases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding more functionalities and efficiency in following updates.</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are not directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be the whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these changes are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it definitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general improvements.</p><p>Those improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what makes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes loading times shorter, etc.</p><p>It’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex to be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready to market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be appropriately integrated and <em>feel right</em> before it can be considered as ready.</p><p>Considering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web, and also because most people access those with pretty decent internet connections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both sellers and buyers now more than ever. Even more so, users will generally be willing to spend a little more if it means simpler and more pleasant user experience. Which leads us to the fourth and final category…</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)</strong></li></ul><p>“UI/UX is everything”, or so… Referring to the previous statement, “users will generally be willing to spend a little more if it means a simpler and more pleasant user experience”.</p><p>Of course, UI/UX is not the only thing that matters, but it is what glues everything together so that it makes sense and just feels right. You can have all the features in the world, but if they are displayed confusingly or unpleasantly, people will generally not even bother. That becomes even truer as a product’s learning curve gets steeper.</p><p>The reason behind this is mostly due to time constraints and the over-saturation of options available to users. Especially in the case of marketplaces — there are hundreds, if not thousands of them. Even if a marketplace’s value proposition is significant, it’s pretty hard to change people’s habits and get them to move from a marketplace they know and feel comfortable using to one that is complicated to understand and doesn’t look as good (it’s pretty fair to say…looks do matter).</p><p>So, is Particl’s Open Marketplace complicated to use? The answer might be “no” to you, but be assured it’s probably a resounding “YES” for most people you know. So how do you make these people leap forward and into this new age for online marketplaces? You gotta make sure that each of these 4 categories is being taken care of by the development team and bring the marketplace to a point that it may finally be considered “adoption-ready”.</p><hr><h2 id=\"in-2020-let-s-tackle-those-issues-\">In 2020, Let’s Tackle Those Issues!</h2><p>Now that we know where lies the adoption hurdles for Particl’s Open Marketplace, it’s now time to strategize and plan around those. As such, <strong>the Particl team has crafted a brand new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond</strong>. With adoption in mind, each of the roadmap items has been carefully selected to eliminate what would make people not want to use the marketplace. There is one specific reason behind each of these items.</p><p>It’s important to understand, though, that the 4 categories mentioned above are tightly intertwined. For example, you can’t spend too much time on UI/UX when the marketplace may still significantly change structure as it will with the integration of Market Management. But you should still do a little, as long as you keep development hours wastes at a minimum. This is why Particl’s development team is focusing on these 4 categories as the underlying line of thinking behind the new roadmap’s content.</p><h3 id=\"the-time-to-reveal-the-new-roadmap-is-now-\">The Time to Reveal the New Roadmap is NOW ?</h3><p>Yes indeed, the time to reveal the new roadmap has arrived!

Then just CLICK HERE and\njump\nstraight to it! [https://particl.io/roadmap/]\nIn the past two weeks, we’ve taken a deep dive into Particl’s current status.\nWe’ve reviewed all of last year’s accomplishments for the project\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] and how its\nOpen Marketplace has evolved since being released\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02] on\nmainnet in August 2019. If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl\nis moving full steam ahead!\n\nHowever, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming\namount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important\nfact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting\nblockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering\nnew and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it\nneeds to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real\nworld”.\n\nLuckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in\nmentality from hype to real-world use-cases is precisely where the blockchain\nindustry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful.\n\nIndeed, the project’s current team [https://particl.io/team] and advisory board\n[https://particl.io/team] are composed of old-school crypto developers,\nlong-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in\nblockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt\nglobal eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking\nout the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible\nwhen relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.\n\nIn other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because\nblockchain is the new cool kid in town. No, it’s because its novel technology is\nbound to have a profound impact on an industry (eCommerce) in dire need of\nimprovements.\n\nThe Path Towards a Greater Adoption of Particl’s Marketplace\nParticl’s Open Marketplace may be live on mainnet, but it’s still Beta software.\nFor that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features,\nor seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s\nall normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after\nBeta).\n\nTo that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in\nits current form have been identified in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430].\n\n * Missing features\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\nThe good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things\nbecause it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, \nquite to the contrary\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d]\n. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.\n\nThat’s precisely with “making Particl adoption-ready” in mind that the Particl\nteam is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and\nbeyond! What’s scheduled to be improved? What features are planned to be\nintegrated? Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of\nthis article!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe New Roadmap is Here!\nParticl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers\nto entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, \neach roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in\ndetail in the Why? section of the roadmap.\n\nTo better plan ahead, it has also been separated into three different\ncategories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features,\nInnovators and Early Adopters. Each phase targets different types of users and\nhas its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items,\nit is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents,\nby user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.\n\nThe more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more\nlikely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also\nmakes the onboarding process increasingly easier.\n\nBefore getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important\npoints:\n\n * The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or\n   see their scope change at any time.\n * There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team\n   plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided,\n   at least for the moment.\n * The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any\n   particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t\n   necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.\n * The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the\n   Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These\n   will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.\n * While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and\n   UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an\n   ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020\nand beyond!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore Marketplace Layer / Key Features\nThis stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due\nto the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and\navailable features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but\nstill lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract\nnew users. At that stage, the entire project is still considered experimental\nand probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta. Even though\nthe marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (and\nthanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ? \n).\n\nMore information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have\nrecently been posted on Particl.news (1\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], 2\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02], 3\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430]).\n\nThe key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of\nmarkets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of\nthat for next to no fee.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInnovators Stage of Adoption\nIf you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is\nwhen it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of\norganic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will\nslowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of\npeople.\n\n“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and\nhave generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate\nabout new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users\nthat start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to\nignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e.\ngiving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know\nwill improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart\nParticl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.\n\nIn the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is\nlikely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and\nparticipants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because\nthey can’t find it elsewhere).\n\nThis phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly\ninteresting ones:\n\n * The fine-tuning of the Escrow (rate, optionality, …)\n * The possibility to run decentralized private auctions\n * A messaging system between buyers and sellers\n * The development SDK (for developers)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarly Adopters Phase of Adoption\nAfter the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early\nadopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher\nthan innovators.\n\nInstead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a\nvery urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as\nproviding them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other\nplatforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all\nsorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new\ntechnologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know\nthe rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them. Whereas innovators tend\nto be fine rushing in, testing out the platform, and help find its pain points,\nearly adopters expect a much more “adoption-ready” platform with as little\nproblems as possible (although they do expect the platform to not be 100%\nready).\n\nIn the specific case of Particl, this stage will likely attract the more\naggressive and opportunistic types of sellers and enterprises. This phase is\nmuch closer to being mainstream-ready, although it is not quite there yet.\n\n> Note: This section of the roadmap is preliminary. More items will be added to it\nas we inch closer to this phase of adoption.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Note\nIf you would like to help with Particl’s development and contribute to one of\nthe items within the roadmap, feel free to contact the team on any of the\nchannels available (Telegram, Discord, Riot, Reddit, etc) or by email\n[http://particl.io/team/].\n\nIf you would instead like to help out on getting new users onboard, then feel\nfree to contact Cryptoguard on any of the channels available (Telegram, Discord,\nRiot, Reddit, etc).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-zT-RLkPxcPnGTA0LSE5X8A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-decade-new-way-to-do-ecommerce-\">New Decade, New Way to do eCommerce! ?</h3><blockquote><a href=\"https://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>Want to see the new development roadmap right now?

If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl is moving full steam ahead!</p><p>However, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming amount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important fact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting blockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering new and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it needs to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real world”.</p><p>Luckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in mentality from hype to real-world use-cases is <strong>precisely where the blockchain industry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://particl.io/team\"><strong>the project’s current team</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://particl.io/team\"><strong>advisory board</strong></a> are composed of old-school crypto developers, long-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in blockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt global eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking out the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible when relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.</p><p>In other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because blockchain is the new cool kid in town.

For that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features, or seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s all normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after Beta).</p><p>To that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in its current form have been identified in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)</strong></li></ul><p>The good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things because it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d\"><strong>quite to the contrary</strong></a>. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.</p><p>That’s precisely with “<strong>making Particl adoption-ready</strong>” in mind that the Particl team is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond!

Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of this article!</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-new-roadmap-is-here-\">The New Roadmap is Here!</h2><p>Particl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers to entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, <strong>each roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in detail in the Why? section </strong>of<strong> </strong>the roadmap.</p><p>To better plan ahead, <strong>it has also been separated into three different categories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features, Innovators and Early Adopters</strong>. Each phase targets different types of users and has its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items, it is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents, by user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-uesNdJ26A9l2Ee2aPJ8duA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more likely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also makes the onboarding process increasingly easier.</p><p><strong>Before getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important points:</strong></p><ul><li>The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or see their scope change at any time.</li><li>There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided, at least for the moment.</li><li>The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.</li><li>The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.</li><li>While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.</li></ul><p><strong>Without further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond!</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"core-marketplace-layer-key-features\">Core Marketplace Layer / Key Features</h2><p>This stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due to the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and available features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but still lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract new users. At that stage, the entire project is <strong>still considered experimental and probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta.</strong> Even though the marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (<strong>and thanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ?</strong> ).</p><p>More information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have recently been posted on Particl.news (<a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02\"><strong>2</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430\"><strong>3</strong></a>).</p><p>The key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of markets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of that for next to no fee.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-G3wprVFhOP5UnX4RmcpZYQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><hr><h2 id=\"innovators-stage-of-adoption\">Innovators Stage of Adoption</h2><p>If you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is when it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of organic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will slowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of people.</p><p>“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and have generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate about new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users that start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to ignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e. giving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know will improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart Particl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.</p><p>In the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is likely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and participants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because they can’t find it elsewhere).</p><p>This phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly interesting ones:</p><ul><li>The <strong>fine-tuning of the Escrow</strong> (rate, optionality, …)</li><li>The possibility to run <strong>decentralized private auctions</strong></li><li>A <strong>messaging system</strong> between buyers and sellers</li><li>The <strong>development SDK </strong>(for developers)</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-wA-g5N96NVKj6gbEZ-DjYw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><hr><h2 id=\"early-adopters-phase-of-adoption\">Early Adopters Phase of Adoption</h2><p>After the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early adopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher than innovators.</p><p>Instead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a very urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as providing them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other platforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all sorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new technologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know the rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them.

There are many challenging yet\nachievable goals proposed by this company that validate the contributions\neveryone has made to Particl so far. They also give positive reinforcement to\nour short and long-term direction of building better tech and attracting more\ndaily users; aka adoption.\n\nThe “who” isn’t as important as is the fact that this is more an intriguing\nsampling of many peer reviews our products are receiving from potential\npartners, investors, services looking to join us on this ride. However — of\ncourse — it does matter “who” is really, truly looking at what is going on in\nthe De-Commerce (has a nice ring to it ?) space so I can divulge that it’s a\nlarge crypto company that touches nearly all the top projects and products in\nour space. This is a group we first reached out to about integrations for\nbroader adoption and the relationship has been nurtured for over a\nyear-and-a-half.\n\nSo what do they have to say? My first thought when I read their feedback and\nrecommendations was, “We need to share this with the community!” I’ve said it\nmany times, in the early stages our voice needs to get louder and louder for\nreal adoption to happen. That means all of us.\n\nIt got me excited about 2020 and beyond — I hope it does you as well.\n> “We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we\ncreated them.” – Albert Einstein, Thinker\nI’ll start at the bottom and work up. First, we have things they identified as\nunsatisfactory or in need of improvements.\n\nAs a trained architect, critique like this is like gold. It’s enlightening to\nread through honest observations, and when we’re enlightened we change.\n\nReducing barriers for adoption\nPrivacy-focused products are niche, underground and nerdy. That’s cool, but\ncan’t be “good enough” and can’t be a crutch to expanding outside of the crypto\necosystem. To this end, Particl is falling into the same trap as Tor, Tails and\neven DuckDuckGo — building better alternatives that add more steps to ensure\nprivacy.\n\n * What are ways we are reducing barriers to see significant marketplace\n   adoption of the Particl Open Marketplace?\n * Is our product available where the target users will find it?\n * Mobile app vs downloadable client\n\nLow transactions using privacy features\nParticl base transactions are private by user choice. Open Marketplace\ntransactions are private by default. Privacy for senders and receivers only\nimproves as the anonymity set increases on chain. Marketplace transactions\nutilize the full suite of privacy features on Particl.\n\n * What are measurable methods to increasing the amount of transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Are there incentives that can be built in to increase transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Can services and exchanges be receptive to enabling private transactions with\n   PART?\n\nQuality and depth of product inventory\nCurrently we have around 500 items listed daily on the Open Marketplace. There\nis a lot of variety from games to electronics to health products. However, I\nthink this is one of the most insightful points within the review. Quantity vs\nquality can be the difference between 1,000 daily users and 10,000 daily users.\n\n * What tools to vendors need to move their inventories onto Particl Open\n   Marketplace?\n * Customers use their phone to shop while Particl only offers a downloadable\n   client, when and how does a mobile version of Open Marketplace improve the\n   quality of products available?\n * Who is the target audience?\n\nNext are three areas we actually are focused on at the moment and internally see\nas crucial to improve on. There is no question the Open Marketplace is an\nattractive product — especially compared to traditionally clunky privacy-focused\napplications and cryptocurrency clients. What can we improve upon to\nmetaphorically put some meat on the strong bones in place to take things to the\nnext level?\n\nMore awareness of the growth on the marketplace\nOur Open Marketplace has been live on the main chain for close to 6 months and\nthe small amount of measurable metrics track-able show that it has been\nrelatively successful and is growing. Being private-by-default doesn’t give\ncompanies reviewing our products much to work with to show either profitability\nor growth. It is really just 2 things, volume and transactions. A third metric\nwe can track is MAD contracts. Not the content but just the amount of them that\nget completed. Keeping things private, but finding better ways to bring\nawareness to the popularity of the Open Marketplace will take an army —who’s in?\n\n * Will private markets and private sales featured in the upcoming Market\n   Management module improve secondary/private marketplace awareness?\n * Does pegging prices to a volatile coin like PART hurt growth possibilities\n   versus introducing a stable coin/fiat pairing?\n * How do vendors promote their products?\n\nAdditional dapps featuring PART\nI think growing our development community outside the primary team is a big\nhurdle we haven’t figured out yet. All our repos are open source and there for\nimprovements by anyone at anytime.\n\n * What type of incentive structure can be established to spur on new developers\n   joining the mission of Particl?\n * Can community funding (kickstarter-like) campaigns usher in more ideas,\n   initiatives, opportunities that the team frankly hasn’t even considered or\n   thought of yet?\n * What is the timeline on a simple SDK toolset with documentation so\n   development teams looking for a solution like Particl has already built can\n   jump-start their big business idea?\n\nIncreasing the anonymity set\nPrivacy projects are always fighting among themselves as to who is the best (of\ncourse except us — of course ?). There’s pros and cons on each out there. The\nreal winners are projects that actually code, the real losers are projects that\njust copy other work and turn around an claim to be somehow better. That said,\nprivacy gets better on chain on every solution with a larger anonymity set.\nThat’s the coins in the most private state — Anon for PART. Monero potentially\nwins this battle and can lay claim to the most private coin. They can thank\nbeing private-by-default for that. It forces users to always be in the most\nprivate state of coin, thus increasing the anonymity set.\n\nThis is why, ultimately, the Open Marketplace is private-by-default. The whole\nnetwork of users, even if you never #sellstuff4crypto\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23sellstuff4crypto] on the marketplace, benefits\nfrom everyone else’s private PARTs.\n\n<!-- That came out weird, but I like it, I’ll keep it in here. -->\n\n * Can staking be advanced to include fully anon PART by default?\n * Would 3rd party services be open to accepting transfers with stealth\n   addresses and private addresses?\n * Is there a future where everything on PART chain is private-by-default?\n * Is it even desirable?\n\nFinally the private review identified 3 milestones Particl should emphatically\nconsider to drive more interest from services, partners and exchanges.\n\nAgain, I think these are great goals and 1,000% achievable with an army of\npassionate users. The louder and louder we become, the simpler the path to\nadoption becomes.\n\nReach 2,500 average daily product listings for one month\n * Currently, we are around 500+ listings and growing.\n\nReach 25,000 total Particl Desktop & Desktop core downloads\n * Currently, we are around 17,000 downloads combined.\n\nPublic reviews for the Marketplace\n * These reviews can be on YouTube, Twitter, Medium, etc\n\nIf you haven’t taken the time to read the latest updates from the team, please\nadd the most recent posts from Crypto Guard [https://medium.com/u/2be55e0c3a02] \nto your reading list. There’s a lot to get excited about this year.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
