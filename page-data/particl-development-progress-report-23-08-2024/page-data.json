We will soon schedule the proposal's voting period and communicate\nthe details to the community as promptly as possible.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have made good progress in merging the listing scanner API with the\nAI-powered moderation system. While this integration is still ongoing and\nrequires further testing, we are pleased with the advancements made this week on\nthat end.\n\nThe listing scanner API has now been merged with the AI-powered moderation\nsystem, with the latter now being mostly complete. We are currently testing the\nsystem and will proceed to start connecting to the marketplace to ensure that\nvotes on listings are properly broadcast to the network.\n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nOrder Book Monitoring ?️\nBasicSwap front-end developer, Crz, has begun work on a system to extract and\npublicly broadcast data from BasicSwap's order book. This development will allow\ncontributors to access and utilize various data points for multiple use cases\nwithout the need to run a local version of BasicSwap.\n\nThe tool will offer greater insight and visibility into available liquidity on\nBasicSwap DEX and the relationships between different offers, enabling\ncontributors to seamlessly integrate the data into their own products or\napplications.\n\nExample of use-case leveraging extracted BasicSwap data (traditional CEX-like\nUI)As illustrated above, the data encompasses a wide range of properties and can\nbe applied to diverse scenarios, including alternative order book display\nmethods, rate comparisons, market depth analysis, and more.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWhile we've pushed a minor GUI fix with regards to QR code, we've continued work\non BasicSwap's larger user interface update coming up soon, although time on\nthat end has been shared with building the aforementioned data broadcasting\nsystem.\n\nAs such, the upcoming GUI updates are still work-in-progress but should be\nreleased shortly.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nThis week, we've continued R&D with regards to messaging protocols in the\ncontext of a more portable version of BasicSwap (via the integration layer).\nWe're currently exploring tapping directly into the SMSG network, without\nrequiring a local SMSG node, which would provide the ability to use SMSG without\nrunning a Particl node on portable (mobile) devices. \n\nWhile possible, we are currently testing what sort of performance using such a\nsetup would result in, and if realistically usable, will likely end up being how\nportable versions of BasicSwap allow peers to communicate swap data with each\nother and access the DEX's order book (with alternative messaging layers being\nimplemented as a secondary priority).\n\nAdditionally, we have begun research and early work into converting some of\nBasicSwap's components into C++, a requirement to allow for portable versions of\nBasicSwap that include adaptor signature atomic swaps and not just HTLC ones.\nWork on that end is likely to take a couple of weeks.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nOur fifth community funding proposal, which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses, is still in its discussion phase.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nWith discussions surrounding the proposal having resurfaced throughout the week,\nwe opted to keep the proposal in its discussion phase for a little more time.\nHowever, we do expect to move it to the voting phase shortly, and we'll\ncommunicate the details to the community as promptly as possible.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nThis week's efforts regarding the marketplace moderation system has been spent\non testing and improving the system, notably with how the app interacts with the\ndistributed LLM network.\n\nAs such, work on the system is still ongoing as we're making changes as they are\nrequired. \n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nOrder Book Monitoring ?️\nWe've made further progress on the system to extract and publicly broadcast data\nfrom BasicSwap's order book that was mentioned last week. This data can be used\nto display BasicSwap-related information in various formats, such as the more\nCEX-like order book interface shown in the screenshot above.\n\nIn the near future, we plan to make this interface accessible at \noffers.basicswapdex.com, including the ability to fetch rates without running\nBasicSwap locally, a feature that will benefit third-party contributors looking\nto utilize this data for a variety of reasons.\n\nWe also plan integrating, later on, this type of order book display directly\ninto BasicSwap as an additional way to view the order book. Note, however, that\nwe do intend on maintaining the current \"marketplace-like\" interface as well,\nproviding users with multiple viewing options.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWork continues on BasicSwap's broader set of user interface updates. However,\njust like last week, our front-end development efforts have been divided between\nthis task and the aforementioned data processing work. As a result, while the\nupcoming GUI updates are still in progress, we expect to release them soon.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe have begun the process of converting portions of the BasicSwap codebase to\nC++. This conversion is a crucial step towards integrating adaptor signature\natomic swaps into third-party platforms.\n\nWhile it's challenging to provide a precise timeline for this task, it\nrepresents a significant milestone in our roadmap, achieving our goals of:\n\n 1. Making BasicSwap compatible with third-party platforms,\n 2. Significantly improving the user experience by integrating the DEX's\n    protocol to portable platforms, such as mobile applications.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving. None of it would be possible without you\nall!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend we'll see you all back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5 \nTeam Funding Proposal #5Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fifth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/]Earlier this week, we\npublished our fifth community funding proposal which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors, as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or feedback regarding the proposal, feel free\nto discuss it within the community channels or leave a direct comment on the CCS\nproposal page (https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24).\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have made good progress in merging the listing scanner API with the\nAI-powered moderation system. While this integration is still ongoing and\nrequires further testing, we are pleased with the advancements made this week on\nthat end.\n\nUpon completion of this merger, our next step will be to connect the new\nmoderation system to the marketplace itself, ensuring that nodes properly\nbroadcast their votes when they need to and that they're applied to the relevant\nlistings.\n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've unfortunately hit some delays pushing the fixes we wanted to over the week\nas our front-end developer has been mostly unavailable due to health reasons.\nFor this reason, the GUI-related section of this progress report remains the\nsame as it was last week.\n\nThat means we're still gearing up to push a minor update in the next couple of\ndays that will fix a few bugs and include a few improvements, notably to the\ndisplay of QR codes in some cases.\n\nFurthermore, we're hoping for a release of the larger GUI update we've been\nworking on for the past few weeks somewhere next week, if all goes well.\n\nThis larger update will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, and you'll\nbe able to test the changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\nThe smaller update, however, will be available directly from the master branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe have continued our investigation into the integration of new, alternative\nmessaging protocols into BasicSwap. This would serve two primary purposes: to\nfacilitate the integration of BasicSwap into third-party applications, which\ncarry their own restrictions, and to provide a backup solution to SMSG in\nscenarios where scalability becomes an issue, such as during a sudden,\nsignificant increase in the number of swaps.\n\nAt this time, we are evaluating several options and are also considering\nstandardizing the integration of messaging layers, which could lead to a\nplugin-like system. This approach would allow users to select their preferred\nmessaging layers in the options, but it is still unclear whether or not that\nwill be the preferable path to follow. While our exploration in this area is\nongoing, we have made satisfactory progress in our research and expect to be\nable to take a decision about it shortly.\n\nAdditionally, following discussions with potential partners, we are reviewing\nsections of the BasicSwap codebase that will likely need to be converted into\ndifferent programming languages to ensure proper integration of the DEX into\nthese third-party platforms and to leverage their infrastructure (e.g.,\nintegrated light node). Although this may involve a substantial amount of work,\nit is crucial for simplifying future integrations and improving fundamental\naspects of the codebase at the same time.\n\nIt's important to note that while we do have several individual components\nrequired for this integration layer either in place or at various stages of\ndevelopment, we are still in the early phases of this process and haven't yet\nfully transitioned out of the R&D phase. As such, we may need to refine or\niterate these components as we progress.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly.

We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
