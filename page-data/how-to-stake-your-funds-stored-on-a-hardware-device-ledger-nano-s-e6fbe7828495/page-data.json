Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to cold vote with funds stored on a Ledger Nano S?\nYes. Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to\nuse the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins\nthat have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be\npart of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give\nany kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our\ndevelopment team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of\nsecurity shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the\nParticl community.\n\nWill Particl be added on Coinbase?\nImran, our Commercial & Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for\nnew exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones.\nThere is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and\nare positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the\n“exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the\nmarketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money\nwhere our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however,\ntell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly\nannounce it.\n\nWe have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more\nprofessional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a\nsolid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list\nus, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might\nnot go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.\n\nAs for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins\nand will work on seizing that opportunity!\n\nWill private listings be able to be governed by the community?\nBoth public and private listings will be governable by the community\nexclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface\nof the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out\nby the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.\n\nThat is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be\ntaken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the\nentire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this\nthreshold should be much harder to reach.\n\nThis will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so\naway from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly\ninappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to\nclean its marketplace from it.\n\nAs for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other\nparty other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate\nout as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high\nfor any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over\nit.\n\nWhen I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show\nup on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s\nthoughts about this?\nWe believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project,\nat least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there,\nhaving only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be\ndue to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller\ncommunity, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms\nsuch as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on\nthe web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick\nup.\n\nIt’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized\nmarketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application\nplatform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the\ndecentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many\nother perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy,\nsecurity, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have\nbeen added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of\nblockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are\nbuilding Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our\nstrongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified\ndiscussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of\nusers.\n\nFollowing a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not\nheavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of\ndevelopment as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when\nbuilding a platform as complex as Particl is.\n\nWhile this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the\nfirst mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have\ncontributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing\ndecentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will\nrequire time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for\nexample, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our\nforum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great\ndiscussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and\nweb-based platform. Please see the dedicated forum section of this update\nfurther down the page.\n\nA while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating\nany of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML\nidentifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?\nIt is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration)\nrequire KYC/AML identification of users on their end to be utilized to their\nfull potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for\nthe Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.\n\nFor clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to\nknow our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess\nthe interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX =\n1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for\npeople wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility\nusually associated with the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and\nwill always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT\ncapabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD\nescrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART\ncoins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and\nis required for them to execute.\n\nStable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow\nusers to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable\nmeans to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the\nParticl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give\neach other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience\nregular people are used to dealing with.\n\nNote that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML\nidentifications, but that will always we offered as an option and will never be\nmandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.\n\nIs the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and\nif so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?\nYes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates\nvulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to\nmitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on\nDiscord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about\nhow we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack\nprecisely.\n\nIs the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks\nas indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or\nWSA’s security audit?\nYes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue\nwas found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many\nof you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we\nlaunched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for\nmainnet implementation.\n\nNote that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the\nmarketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for\nmainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users\nto be aware of it coming.\n\nIs RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace\nmainnet?\nMost likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time\nas the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the\nmarketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into\nBulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce\nprivacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.\n\nThe first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting\nto RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for\nthe marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would\nrelease without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for\na while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated\nabout this as we know more.\n\nWhat is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what\nimpact would that carry for the Particl project?\nMOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the\nParticl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &\nBranding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we\ndid in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.\n\nWhile we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did\nsuggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it\nto Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both\ncommunities.\n\nWhat makes Particl better than its competition?\nParticl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact\nthat we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from\nOpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as\nthey are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nBut the most important factors which makes us much different than any of our\ncompetitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization\nwithout compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace,\nit is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they\nemploy moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form\nof escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to\nbe hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it\nalso leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow\nagent and one of the parties involved.\n\nWhile it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party,\nit is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party\nto make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace\ntransaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if\none of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where\nmoderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to\nthe participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you\ncan refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\n\nAre there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences\nand meetups?\nAbsolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we\nnoticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show\nfor, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of\nattention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by\nthe number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells\nus that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we\nreceived from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.\n\nOur budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development\nphase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping\n“vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences,\ncrypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go\nthrough our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than\nwe did during the coin swap.\n\nWe would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl\nin meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such\nevent, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you\nwould need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact\nPaul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community\nManager, if you are interested.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!\nWe announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed\nfrom Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the\ntime of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was\navailable. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a\nproper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, making Particl\nthe world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol. To enable your Ledger Nano S\nhardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this\ntutorial: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\n\nNote: While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the\nmore advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of\nthe more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you\nwait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.\n\nNew Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit\nAs mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and\noversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially\nworking on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on\nAugust 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code\nand has even pushed his first commit\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113], a rather large one, on\nGithub which shows great professionalism. In fact, zaSmilingIdiot\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] has a lot of experience working with large\nteams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our\nproject and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\n\nIt is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests,\nGithub will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes\nand updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This\ncan be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.\n\nPull Request Updates IndicatorNew Status Report Published Includes New Exciting\nDevelopments\nSpeaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status\nReport showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our\nlast Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review”\ncategory, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing\nphase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (which is already available to\nanyone as a stable mainnet pre-release\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) and the\nlong-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0). If all the testing\ngoes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the\nother on Particl Marketplace Alpha (can be downloaded here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) in the coming\nweeks.\n\nStaking Pools Incoming!\nOne of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the\ninclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category.\nThis is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible\noptions to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl\nnetwork by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact,\nTecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool\nproof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive\nconstant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands,\nanyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with\nsmaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in\n~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to\nwait several months in between staking rewards.\n\nWith a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool\nwhich has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments,\nsimilarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up\ntheir hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.\n\nMore details about this feature will be given at a later time.\n\nMarketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!\nOur governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the\nlast few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start\nbeing integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark\na very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be\ntentatively expected for the new few weeks.\n\nWe hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these\nfeatures, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made,\nand such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more\nquickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to\nfall into place!\n\nA New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its\nInception\nToday we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come\nout next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able\nto produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that\nour development team has put into Particl since its inception.\n\nIn this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with\ntheir names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names\nwritten in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development\nrepositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are\nexcluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and\nother repos instrumental to the development of the project.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are\nregardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping\nour codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts\nthe project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core\nat all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting\nus all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments\nmade over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as\nParticl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!\n\nThe PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!\nWe announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX\ncommunity to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the\nParticl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace\ntransactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get\nlisted on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate\ntogether for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and\ndecentralization (more details here: \nhttps://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379).\n\nThe voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that\nthe proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands,\nthe votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very\nhappy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and\ncooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it\nas a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the\nstart of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two\nprojects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required\nto be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more\njoint proposals appearing in the future.\n\nTo track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: \nhttp://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\n\nDownload and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the\nmarketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major\nchanges (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl\nDesktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download Particl\nDesktop 1.2.2 [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2] \ntoday in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is\na major update on the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A\nmajority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more\nuser-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!\n\nMore Updates Being Made to the Website\nOur official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and\nupdates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently\nrevamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a\nwider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is Coin\nSpecifications [https://particl.io/coin-specifications/], a page entirely\ndedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects\nof the Particl coin and blockchain.\n\nTo see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on\nGithub here: https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\n\nForum Update\nAlmost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final\nemail issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases,\nconfirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either\nnot reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which\nisn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.\n\nIf you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some\nfeedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord\nand he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the\nregistration email.\n\nBitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped\nAt the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are\nalso working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely\noutdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more\nactive. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to\nthe top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment.\nWe are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the\nthread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT\nthread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something\nwe will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.\n\nParticl is on Mastodon\nDid you know of Mastodon? It is an open-source and decentralized social media\nplatform on which we have an account registered on. Make sure to give us a\nfollow for yet another way to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest news\nsurrounding the project by following the link here: \nhttps://mastodon.social/@particl\n\nWhat is Satoshi Citadel Industries?\nWe posted yesterday an interview with Miguel Cunetta, one of our key advisor,\nwhere he explains what is Satoshi Citadel Industries.

Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to use the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins that have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be part of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give any kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our development team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of security shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the Particl community.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-be-added-on-coinbase\">Will Particl be added on Coinbase?</h3><p>Imran, our Commercial &amp; Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for new exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones. There is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and are positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the “exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the marketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money where our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however, tell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly announce it.</p><p>We have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more professional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a solid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating any of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML identifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?</h3><p>It is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration) require KYC/AML identification of users <strong>on their end </strong>to be utilized to their full potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for the Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.</p><p>For clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to know our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess the interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX = 1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for people wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility usually associated with the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Rest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and will always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT capabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD escrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART coins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and is required for them to execute.</p><p>Stable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow users to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable means to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the Particl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give each other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience regular people are used to dealing with.</p><p>Note that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML identifications, but that will <strong>always</strong> we offered as an option and will <strong>never </strong>be mandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-team-aware-of-the-nothing-at-stake-attack-on-pos-consensus-algorithms-and-if-so-how-does-it-intend-to-fix-this-vulnerability\">Is the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and if so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?</h3><p>Yes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates vulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to mitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on Discord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about how we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack precisely.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-ringct-protocol-ready-for-mainnet-or-does-it-still-requires-some-tweaks-as-indicated-by-either-the-njit-department-of-technology-academic-report-or-wsa-s-security-audit\">Is the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks as indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or WSA’s security audit?</h3><p>Yes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue was found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many of you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we launched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for mainnet implementation.</p><p>Note that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the marketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for mainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users to be aware of it coming.</p><h3 id=\"is-ringct-on-marketplace-transactions-a-requirement-for-particl-marketplace-mainnet\">Is RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace mainnet?</h3><p>Most likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time as the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the marketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into Bulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce privacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.</p><p>The first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting to RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for the marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would release without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for a while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated about this as we know more.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-moin-why-are-they-looking-into-forking-the-particl-codebase-and-what-impact-would-that-carry-for-the-particl-project\">What is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what impact would that carry for the Particl project?</h3><p>MOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the Particl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &amp; Branding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we did in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.</p><p>While we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did suggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it to Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both communities.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-better-than-its-competition\">What makes Particl better than its competition?</h3><p>Particl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact that we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from OpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as they are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized marketplace.</p><p>But the most important factors which makes us much different than <strong>any </strong>of our competitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization without compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace, it is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they employ moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form of escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to be hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it also leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow agent and one of the parties involved.</p><p>While it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party, it is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users.

He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism.

While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly.

Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A majority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl Desktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!</p><h3 id=\"more-updates-being-made-to-the-website\">More Updates Being Made to the Website</h3><p>Our official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and updates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently revamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a wider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is <a href=\"https://particl.io/coin-specifications/\">Coin Specifications</a>, a page entirely dedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects of the Particl coin and blockchain.</p><p>To see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on Github here: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\">https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master</a></p><h3 id=\"forum-update\">Forum Update</h3><p>Almost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final email issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases, confirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either not reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which isn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.</p><p>If you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some feedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord and he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the registration email.</p><h3 id=\"bitcointalk-opening-post-being-revamped\">BitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped</h3><p>At the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are also working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely outdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT thread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something we will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.</p><h3 id=\"particl-is-on-mastodon\">Particl is on Mastodon</h3><p>Did you know of Mastodon?

Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to use the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins that have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be part of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give any kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our development team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of security shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the Particl community.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-be-added-on-coinbase\">Will Particl be added on Coinbase?</h3><p>Imran, our Commercial &#x26; Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for new exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones. There is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and are positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the “exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the marketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money where our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however, tell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly announce it.</p><p>We have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more professional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a solid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating any of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML identifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?</h3><p>It is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration) require KYC/AML identification of users <strong>on their end </strong>to be utilized to their full potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for the Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.</p><p>For clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to know our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess the interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX = 1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for people wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility usually associated with the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Rest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and will always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT capabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD escrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART coins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and is required for them to execute.</p><p>Stable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow users to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable means to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the Particl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give each other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience regular people are used to dealing with.</p><p>Note that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML identifications, but that will <strong>always</strong> we offered as an option and will <strong>never </strong>be mandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-team-aware-of-the-nothing-at-stake-attack-on-pos-consensus-algorithms-and-if-so-how-does-it-intend-to-fix-this-vulnerability\">Is the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and if so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?</h3><p>Yes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates vulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to mitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on Discord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about how we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack precisely.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-ringct-protocol-ready-for-mainnet-or-does-it-still-requires-some-tweaks-as-indicated-by-either-the-njit-department-of-technology-academic-report-or-wsa-s-security-audit\">Is the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks as indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or WSA’s security audit?</h3><p>Yes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue was found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many of you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we launched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for mainnet implementation.</p><p>Note that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the marketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for mainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users to be aware of it coming.</p><h3 id=\"is-ringct-on-marketplace-transactions-a-requirement-for-particl-marketplace-mainnet\">Is RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace mainnet?</h3><p>Most likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time as the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the marketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into Bulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce privacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.</p><p>The first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting to RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for the marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would release without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for a while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated about this as we know more.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-moin-why-are-they-looking-into-forking-the-particl-codebase-and-what-impact-would-that-carry-for-the-particl-project\">What is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what impact would that carry for the Particl project?</h3><p>MOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the Particl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &#x26; Branding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we did in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.</p><p>While we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did suggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it to Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both communities.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-better-than-its-competition\">What makes Particl better than its competition?</h3><p>Particl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact that we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from OpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as they are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized marketplace.</p><p>But the most important factors which makes us much different than <strong>any </strong>of our competitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization without compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace, it is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they employ moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form of escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to be hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it also leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow agent and one of the parties involved.</p><p>While it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party, it is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users.

He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism.

While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to fall into place!</p><h3 id=\"a-new-video-showing-the-impressive-amount-of-work-put-into-particl-since-its-inception\">A New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its Inception</h3><p>Today we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come out next week.

Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A majority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl Desktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!</p><h3 id=\"more-updates-being-made-to-the-website\">More Updates Being Made to the Website</h3><p>Our official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and updates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently revamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a wider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is <a href=\"https://particl.io/coin-specifications/\">Coin Specifications</a>, a page entirely dedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects of the Particl coin and blockchain.</p><p>To see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on Github here: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\">https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master</a></p><h3 id=\"forum-update\">Forum Update</h3><p>Almost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final email issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases, confirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either not reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which isn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.</p><p>If you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some feedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord and he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the registration email.</p><h3 id=\"bitcointalk-opening-post-being-revamped\">BitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped</h3><p>At the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are also working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely outdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT thread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something we will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.</p><h3 id=\"particl-is-on-mastodon\">Particl is on Mastodon</h3><p>Did you know of Mastodon?

For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform.

The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions.

The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform.

As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to have prices displayed in their fiat value?\nWhile currently not available on Particl Marketplace Alpha, yes, this is\nsomething that ultimately would be part of Particl Marketplace. Paul speculated\nabout how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway\npoint is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a\nfeature that will, in the end, be enabled.\n\nWill there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to\ntheir product listing on the web?\nEverything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital\nfunction for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed.\nIn fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on\nthe public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a\ncustom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature\nwould also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.\n\nWe’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web\n& mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on\ndecentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce\nplatform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would\nmake the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).\n\nIs it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any\nspecific dates?\nThe two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are\nthe marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are\nalso heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on\ntestnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the\nRingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet\never since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT\nDepartment of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.\n\nWe can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are\ngoing to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the\nnext steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit\ntestnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet\nintegration alongside RingCT.\n\nThere are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that\ntimeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet\nrelease goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.\n\nAs always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be\nupdated soon.\n\nHave a notification system for vendors been put in place?\nAbsolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been\nintegrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.\n\nHas the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?\nYes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post\nintroducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like\nwe usually do.\n\nAny new Particl merchandise coming up?\nYes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types\nof merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a poll\non\nTwitter asking for your suggestions\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801].\n\nWe’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also\nusing our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest\nwith. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made\navailable!\n\nIs there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?\nYes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed\nwith PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that\nPART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right\ninto Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other\nout with some cross-promotion campaign.\n\nBoth teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace,\neffectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols\nin a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration\nwould, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this\nconcept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment,\nboth teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s\ndefinitely being kept in mind on both sides.\n\nThe proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving\nout details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!\n\nEDIT: For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still\nultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow\nsmart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Hardware Integration is Here!\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt\nMacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following\nthis link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is\ncurrently not available. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary\nsolution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop\nis completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop\nintegration will be given out in further updates.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\nParticl, Bitcoin & PIVX on the Ledger NanoAfter having submitted our own Ledger\n“third-party application\n[https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications]\n” to Ledger [https://www.ledger.com/] weeks ago, it has finally been officially\nintegrated into Ledger’s Nano S hardware devices\n[https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s] and Ledger Live\n[https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live]. That means you can now safely store\nyour PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the\nsecurity of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. This also makes Particl\nthe first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just\nsimply hardware staking.\n\n> As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden\nyour wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting\nhacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a\ncomputer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime\ntargets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected\ncomputers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.—\nParticl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]\nThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware\ndevice.

Paul speculated about how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway point is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a feature that will, in the end, be enabled.</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-share-feature-where-vendors-will-be-able-to-send-a-link-to-their-product-listing-on-the-web\">Will there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to their product listing on the web?</h3><p>Everything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital function for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed. In fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on the public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a custom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature would also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.</p><p>We’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web &amp; mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on decentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce platform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would make the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).</p><h3 id=\"is-it-possible-to-have-the-order-at-which-releases-will-be-ready-without-any-specific-dates\">Is it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any specific dates?</h3><p>The two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are the marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are also heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on testnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the RingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet ever since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT Department of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.</p><p>We can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are going to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the next steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit testnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet integration alongside RingCT.</p><p>There are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that timeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet release goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.</p><p>As always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be updated soon.</p><h3 id=\"have-a-notification-system-for-vendors-been-put-in-place\">Have a notification system for vendors been put in place?</h3><p>Absolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been integrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.</p><h3 id=\"has-the-new-particl-desktop-developer-started-working-yet\">Has the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?</h3><p>Yes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post introducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like we usually do.</p><h3 id=\"any-new-particl-merchandise-coming-up\">Any new Particl merchandise coming up?</h3><p>Yes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types of merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801\">poll on Twitter asking for your suggestions</a>.</p><p>We’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also using our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest with. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made available!</p><h3 id=\"is-there-any-update-about-the-pivx-alliance-conference-call\">Is there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?</h3><p>Yes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed with PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that PART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right into Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other out with some cross-promotion campaign.</p><p>Both teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace, effectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols in a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration would, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this concept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment, both teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s definitely being kept in mind on both sides.</p><p>The proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving out details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still ultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow smart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-hardware-integration-is-here-\">Ledger Hardware Integration is Here!</h3><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt MacOS.

Paul speculated about how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway point is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a feature that will, in the end, be enabled.</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-share-feature-where-vendors-will-be-able-to-send-a-link-to-their-product-listing-on-the-web\">Will there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to their product listing on the web?</h3><p>Everything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital function for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed. In fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on the public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a custom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature would also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.</p><p>We’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web &#x26; mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on decentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce platform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would make the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).</p><h3 id=\"is-it-possible-to-have-the-order-at-which-releases-will-be-ready-without-any-specific-dates\">Is it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any specific dates?</h3><p>The two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are the marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are also heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on testnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the RingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet ever since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT Department of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.</p><p>We can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are going to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the next steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit testnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet integration alongside RingCT.</p><p>There are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that timeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet release goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.</p><p>As always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be updated soon.</p><h3 id=\"have-a-notification-system-for-vendors-been-put-in-place\">Have a notification system for vendors been put in place?</h3><p>Absolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been integrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.</p><h3 id=\"has-the-new-particl-desktop-developer-started-working-yet\">Has the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?</h3><p>Yes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post introducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like we usually do.</p><h3 id=\"any-new-particl-merchandise-coming-up\">Any new Particl merchandise coming up?</h3><p>Yes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types of merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801\">poll on Twitter asking for your suggestions</a>.</p><p>We’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also using our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest with. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made available!</p><h3 id=\"is-there-any-update-about-the-pivx-alliance-conference-call\">Is there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?</h3><p>Yes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed with PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that PART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right into Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other out with some cross-promotion campaign.</p><p>Both teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace, effectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols in a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration would, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this concept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment, both teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s definitely being kept in mind on both sides.</p><p>The proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving out details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still ultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow smart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-hardware-integration-is-here-\">Ledger Hardware Integration is Here!</h3><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt MacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following this link:</em><em><strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\"><em>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0</em></a></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is currently </em><em><strong>not available</strong></em><em>. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary solution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop is completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop integration will be given out in further updates.</em></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s Portfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports storing Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking, voting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a later time, this mostly depends on Ledger.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-ql_nYCy4FkvR35V2f9HolQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl, Bitcoin &#x26; PIVX on the Ledger Nano</figcaption></figure><p>After having submitted our own Ledger “<a href=\"https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications\">third-party application</a>” to <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger</a> weeks ago, it has finally been officially integrated into Ledger’s <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s\">Nano S hardware devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live\">Ledger Live</a>. That means you can now safely store your PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the security of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. <strong>This also makes Particl the first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just simply hardware staking</strong>.</p><blockquote>As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.<a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">— Particl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking</a><br>The <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger Nano S</a> is a hardware wallet, a special type of bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.<br>— <a href=\"http://particl.wiki/ledger\">Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S</a><br></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-T2j6SkK4e2E6aO1sSELHKw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Furthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security shouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as it relates to its governance (true democracy -> no voice left unheard). As such, this Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not straight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited to, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community as well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever requiring to expose their private keys.</p><p>This announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey, demonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain solutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible package that does not infringe on the user experience.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-project-governance\">Decentralized Project Governance</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-PIFRczbnqdeXq5vQPKr4pg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">We also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project governance</a> that is nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with our legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it too restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.</p><p>The main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides in the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the same time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds are stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to the Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability and democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its final testing phase and to begin testnet integration.</p><p>We also announced in our <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Decentralized Project Governance update</a> that there were a total of ~<a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">33,800 PART</a> left in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate voting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits mainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and ideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-0-17-0-2-really-\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?</h3><p>For those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a surprise that <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\">Tecnovert</a>, our Core Developer &#x26; Cryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2</a>. <em>TV </em>is known for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge the latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it. Usually, it takes a few weeks, sometimes even days after the release. But this time, it seems like Tecnovert has been working overtime on 0.17, so it will be interesting to see if he has anything special under the hood or if he’s just being extremely diligent.</p><p>For a rough 0.17 release timeline from Bitcoin Core, please visit this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-lB2nJnMgGZApAI1E8Ueweg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">We released on the third of August a new Status Report on our website</a>. This report is quite similar to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-status-report-released-8ca69930cfd\">previous Status Report</a> but also contains some new, exciting information about the state of Particl Marketplace development. Indeed, the “Wrapped Up” section of the report shows that a lot of items for the marketplace have been completed, including the Project Governance and Marketplace Governance tools. Some of the items marked as “Pending Review” have also been completed since we posted this report 7 days ago, including the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">Ledger hardware integration</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> (currently on pre-release, mainnet).

Indeed, the project has reached a stage where our team has gained a lot of experience and have adapted their work methods to better organize and deliver more efficiently. That much can be seen on our Github with as much as 3 to 6 repositories being updated daily and by how fast items in our Status Report are getting hammered.</p><p>A lot of this can be attributed to our two new managers, Carmen and Vivienne, as well as the new<a href=\"https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/\"> Agile methodologies</a> and strategies the team has established during its last meeting in Prague. It is worth noting that Github is <strong>only the tip of the iceberg</strong>, most of the development process and communications happening internally using <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\"><strong>Jira</strong></a>.</p><p>As we are seeing a lot of items being marked as completed and as we keep hiring new developers such as our new Particl Desktop developer or any developer we will be hiring after the primary funding round, the Particl project is slowly entering into a new phase. We will soon reach a point where a lot of the pieces will start falling into place in a relatively short period of time while the development pace keeps increasing. Furthermore, the future release of our developer SDK should also attract many more “outside” developers contributing themselves to the accelerating development pace of the project. Simply put, we believe our best days are ahead of us and at arm’s length.</p><p><strong>Teaser: </strong>We will post next week a video demonstrating the impressive work our developers have put into Particl since we embarked on this journey a little more than a year ago. This demonstration will be in the form of a Github contribution timeline and will help understand several factors associated with the development of an open-source project.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology.
