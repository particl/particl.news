It presented itself as a great\nopportunity for the team members to meet the co-workers they’ve been working\nwith for some time (and in some cases, years), as well as being the perfect\nopportunity to get as many heads working together and brainstorming as possible.\n\nThere’s one thing that is absolutely sure and that definitely stands up the\nminute these meetings start: the level of expertise, knowledge, and passion\nwithin the team is simply out of this world! On their own, each of the team\nmembers is quite impressive in terms of skills. When they get together, however,\nthat’s when the magic happens.\n\nGetting Particl Marketplace Beta Ready\nThe meetings were, for the most part, exclusively focused on the development and\nmanagement of the project with a particular look on the short to mid-term.\n\nThe development team first focused on what needed to be done more urgently in\nregards to the finalization of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. Suffice\nto say, we are definitely getting to the very end of the Alpha stage of\ndevelopment and only minor tweaks and additions (notably linked to software\nstability and governance) are still left to add. While that is not necessarily\nfresh news, it does confirm that we might only be weeks away from the release of\nthe long-awaited Beta version of the marketplace, on testnet first of course.\n\nIt was also discussed that Particl Marketplace Beta might release initially as a\nLite Beta, then followed by more frequent than now Release Candidates, each of\nthem adding a new feature not present in the previous version. For example, it\nis very likely that the very first Release Candidate of Particl Marketplace Beta\nmight not contain RingCT/CT privacy features integrated into the escrow system\nas Tecnovert is still working on improving the RingCT protocol with\nprivacy-enhancing tweaks as well as Bulletproofs.\n\nIt was also heavily considered by the team that Particl Marketplace Beta, once\nstable enough and properly tested, might hit mainnet before Particl Marketplace\n1.0 is fully completed. The timeline of the mainnet release is of course not\navailable as a lot of it depends on moving targets and at how fast the platform\ncan be made stable enough to use with real money. This early mainnet period will\nbe extremely useful to test the dynamics of the many decentralized mechanisms in\nplace within the platform such as MAD escrow, anti-spam measures, governance,\nand etc.\n\nPost-Beta Items\nAnother very important task of this series of meetings was to draw an internal\nroadmap of development tasks and decide on what is going to be worked on after \nthe release of the Beta version of the marketplace. One of the decisions the\ndevelopers took was to now mostly focus on one feature at a time instead of\nworking on many at once. This will definitely help in releasing new features\nwith each Release Candidates and publish them in shorter timeframes as they are\nright now.\n\nDISCLAIMER: What follows is a list of items the development team will most\nlikely be working on after the initial release of Particl Marketplace Beta.\nItems are placed in no particular order and there is no public timeline \navailable for these. As with everything development-related, some of these items\nmay be abandoned and new ones might start being worked before others, and thus\nnone of what follows can be interpreted as “promises”. The purpose of this list\nis only to give you a general idea of what the team currently has in mind.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarketplace-Related\n> IPFS: IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System, and is a decentralized data\nstorage network\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \n(DSN). Particl Marketplace will use IPFS to store messages and data, which is\nexpected to reduce listing fees as well as increase the quality of the uploaded\ndata (i.e. listing pictures in higher quality).Note that, while IPFS will make\nit more affordable to use the marketplace, it does not provide the user with the\nsame level of privacy as SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html],\nParticl’s current default DSN. This is why the marketplace will likely default\nwith IPFS and allow to manually change the default DSN in the Settings page.\nFollow the link below to get more information about IPFS.\n\nWhat is IPFS? [https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\nIPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. At its core it is a versioned file\nsystem which can store files and track…\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]medium.com\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\n\n> Reputation System: Many of you will be happy to see this item. Vendor reputation\nis an almost necessary information for buyers when shopping online and has been\nrequested by a lot of you from the community. While the exact implementation and\nmechanism still remain unsettled for the moment, this is one of the items that\nwill eventually make its way onto Particl Marketplace.Payment Gateways: As a\ncore aspect of our vision, Particl Marketplace is designed to be a marketplace\nwhere many different cryptocurrencies are accepted. Thus, a gateway, initially\none for Bitcoin-only, will be integrated on Particl Marketplace. The initial\nintegration might probably be a third-party integration, but as proper\ndecentralized solutions rise up, expect the team to keep a close eye on them and\nwork towards integrating solutions aligned with our own vision.\nPrice Pegging: Important for a smooth user experience as well as mainstream\nadoption, price pegging is the ability to price an item according to the\ncurrency of your choice. It means a vendor could decide, for example, to sell an\nitem for $150 USD, and that item would still remain listed at $150 regardless of\nthe PART coin price fluctuation. Price pegging will also make it possible for\npeople to display posted listings in the currency of their choice.\nVendor/Buyer Communication: The ability to message the other party in a \nmutually\nassured destruction [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction] \nscenario, the game-theory scenario on which Particl Marketplace’s MAD escrow is\ndesigned), is tricky.\nOn one hand, it is necessary for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate\nbetween each other. On the other hand, it needs to be done in a way that reduces\nthe risk of the vendor blackmailing the buyer to a minimum. Ultimately, if there\nis no way for involved parties to communicate within the platform, it is simply\ngoing to be taken off-platform.\nThis is why the team has decided to craft a special communication system where\nblackmailing possibilities will be reduced to a minimum. We will give more\ndetails about the messaging system once we are getting closer to its release\nMessaging System: While not exclusive to the marketplace, the messaging system\nwill also be available, in full, but without buyer/vendor relationship. This\nwill render possible individual and group chats directly from within Particl\nDesktop, a feature that will make secure messaging as easy and effortless as\nwriting a normal message on any other application. This messaging system will be\nparticularly useful for Particl Bubble members (people possessing the Market ID\nof private/community markets) to really bond together and foster sub-communities\nwithin the marketplace itself.\nFiat Payment Gateways: Fiat payment gateways are integrations that allow users\nto pay for items on Particl Marketplace using more traditional means of payments\nsuch as a credit card. It’s important to note that, for convenience and legal\nreasons, this particular item may never make its way onto Particl Marketplace at\nany point in time. While this is an item that is being seriously considered and\nactively researched by the team, a payment solution would need to be compatible\nwith our own vision and not require the user to go through numerous tedious\nsteps in order to be integrated into Particl Desktop.\nEscrow Refunds & Recovery: One way Particl’s MAD escrow can become problematic\nis if one of the two parties isn’t able to access the smart-contract anymore,\nthus making it impossible to retrieve any funds or complete a transaction. This\nis why the team will be focused on building a refund and recovery option for the\nescrow system in order to make it more secure and resilient to unforeseen\nproblems.\nCode refactoring: As Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring] \nputs it, “code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer\ncode — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior.”. This\nrefactoring process, already underway, will make Particl Marketplace much faster\nand smoother to use. This aims at giving the marketplace the same level of\nresponsiveness you would expect from web-based platforms.\nTranslations: Not exclusive to the marketplace, translations will eventually\nmake their way onto Particl Desktop. It will then be possible for you to\nregister on the Particl translation team and contribute on making Particl\nDesktop available in your favourite language using Transifex\n[https://www.transifex.com/].\nShipping Carrier Integration: A possible, yet not guaranteed, integration the\nteam has been wanting to have is for shipping carrier information to be able to\nbe tracked directly from within the marketplace itself. In other words, this\nintegration would allow you to track your orders without having to leave\nParticl. Another good step towards convenience!\nFollow a Vendor: This self-explanatory feature will allow you the follow your\nfavorite vendors on the marketplace. The exact implementation hasn’t been\ndecided on, but it is likely that, for privacy reasons, it will be an opt-in\noption for vendors to allow their customers to follow them around.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore-Related\n> Latest Bitcoin Codebase: As always, we are committed to keeping the Particl\ncodebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s. This allows the project to benefit from all\nthe breakthroughs made to the Bitcoin codebase, some of which being directly\nincluded into this list.RingCT Improvements: As stated for a few weeks now, our\nLead Cryptographer & Core Developer, Tecnovert, has been making a few tweaks on\nthe RingCT protocol. These tweaks are specifically intended to make the RingCT\nprotocol more private than it currently is on other coins’ implementations.\nBecause of the nature of these tweaks, we cannot reveal any detail at this\nmoment as to keep the exclusivity on the improvements.\nBulletproofs: The Bulletproofs protocol improvement allows RingCT transactions\nto be dramatically reduced in size, making them cheaper to send as well as more\nlightweight on the blockchain. This will greatly help the Particl blockchain to\nstay as scalable and fast to sync as possible over a long period of time.\nLightning Network: The Lightning Network allows transactions to be sent at a\nnear-instant speed and at near-zero cost. The implementation of this protocol is\nexpected to be one of the main areas of focus for Tecnovert this year. It will\nhelp with the execution of atomic swaps, the scalability of the network, as well\nas potentially be made available with private transactions.\nSidechains: Another area of interest for 2019, as mentioned by Tecnovert, is the\nresearch and development of side-chain solutions for Particl. As defined by \nHackerNoon [https://hackernoon.com/what-are-sidechains-1c45ea2daf3], a “\nsidechain is a separate blockchain\n[https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-versus-traditional-databases-c1a728159f79] \nthat is attached to its parent blockchain using a two-way peg”. No additional\ninformation concerning sidechains on Particl is publicly available yet, so stay\non alert for more information about this in 2019!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, the South Africa team meeting has been super productive and have\nreally helped pave the way for the next few months to be impactful for the\nproject. With new developers, like Rob, jumping on board, it can only be\nexpected that the development pace is going to keep increasing as time goes. The\nteam is now really well organized with development managers and agile\nmethodologies which makes Particl’s future really look bright.\n\nP.S.: Don’t miss our blog post early next week where we will reveal a big\nconference Particl will be attending next year with a booth, a presence that was\nconcretized while we were in South Africa!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-T3ZHDBgILfKJxfTO7-ZiYg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-uvoqDP5zna4QKYLJgBLUog.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in <strong>South Africa</strong> from the <strong>16th of November to the 24th</strong> for a series of important development meetings that would shape the short to mid-term path forward for the project.</p><p>Contrary to previous meetings held in Prague and Switzerland where mostly the core group met, this one was planned to gather most of the developers as well as some members of the communications team together.

Particl Marketplace will use </em><em><strong>IPFS</strong></em><em> to store messages and data, which is expected to reduce listing fees as well as increase the quality of the uploaded data (i.e. listing pictures in higher quality).</em><em>Note that, while </em><em><strong>IPFS</strong></em><em> will make it more affordable to use the marketplace, it does not provide the user with the same level of privacy as </em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html\"><em><strong>SMSG</strong></em></a><em>, Particl’s current default DSN.

While the exact implementation and mechanism still remain unsettled for the moment, this is one of the items that will eventually make its way onto Particl Marketplace.</em><em><strong>Payment Gateways: </strong></em><em>As a core aspect of our vision, Particl Marketplace is designed to be a marketplace where many different cryptocurrencies are accepted. Thus, a gateway, </em><em><strong>initially one for Bitcoin-only</strong></em><em>, will be integrated on Particl Marketplace. The initial integration might probably be a third-party integration, but as proper decentralized solutions rise up, expect the team to keep a close eye on them and work towards integrating solutions aligned with our own vision.</em><br><em><strong>Price Pegging:</strong></em><em> Important for a smooth user experience as well as mainstream adoption, price pegging is the ability to price an item according to the currency of your choice. It means a vendor could decide, for example, to sell an item for $150 USD, and that item would still remain listed at $150 regardless of the PART coin price fluctuation. Price pegging will also make it possible for people to display posted listings in the currency of their choice.</em><br><em><strong>Vendor/Buyer Communication:</strong></em><em> The ability to message the other party in a </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\"><em><strong>mutually assured destruction</strong></em></a><em><strong> </strong></em><em>scenario, the game-theory scenario on which Particl Marketplace’s MAD escrow is designed), is tricky.</em><br><em>On one hand, it is necessary for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate between each other. On the other hand, it needs to be done in a way that reduces the risk of the vendor blackmailing the buyer to a minimum. Ultimately, if there is no way for involved parties to communicate within the platform, it is simply going to be taken off-platform.</em><br><em>This is why the team has decided to craft a special communication system where blackmailing possibilities will be reduced to a minimum. We will give more details about the messaging system once we are getting closer to its release</em><br><em><strong>Messaging System:</strong></em><em> While not exclusive to the marketplace, the messaging system will also be available, in full, but without buyer/vendor relationship. This will render possible individual and group chats directly from within Particl Desktop, a feature that will make secure messaging as easy and effortless as writing a normal message on any other application. This messaging system will be particularly useful for Particl Bubble members (people possessing the Market ID of private/community markets) to really bond together and foster sub-communities within the marketplace itself.</em><br><em><strong>Fiat Payment Gateways:</strong></em><em> Fiat payment gateways are integrations that allow users to pay for items on Particl Marketplace using more traditional means of payments such as a credit card. It’s important to note that, for convenience and legal reasons, this particular item </em><em><strong>may never make its way onto Particl Marketplace at any point in time</strong></em><em>. While this is an item that is being seriously considered and actively researched by the team, a payment solution would need to be compatible with our own vision and not require the user to go through numerous tedious steps in order to be integrated into Particl Desktop.</em><br><em><strong>Escrow Refunds &#x26; Recovery:</strong></em><em> One way Particl’s MAD escrow can become problematic is if one of the two parties isn’t able to access the smart-contract anymore, thus making it impossible to retrieve any funds or complete a transaction. This is why the team will be focused on building a refund and recovery option for the escrow system in order to make it more secure and resilient to unforeseen problems.</em><br><em><strong>Code refactoring:</strong></em><em> As </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\"><em><strong>Wikipedia</strong></em></a><em> puts it, “</em>code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior.<em>”. This refactoring process, already underway, will make Particl Marketplace much faster and smoother to use. This aims at giving the marketplace the same level of responsiveness you would expect from web-based platforms.</em><br><em><strong>Translations:</strong></em><em> Not exclusive to the marketplace, translations will eventually make their way onto Particl Desktop. It will then be possible for you to register on the Particl translation team and contribute on making Particl Desktop available in your favourite language using </em><a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/\"><em><strong>Transifex</strong></em></a><em>.</em><br><em><strong>Shipping Carrier Integration:</strong></em><em> A possible, yet not guaranteed, integration the team has been wanting to have is for shipping carrier information to be able to be tracked directly from within the marketplace itself. In other words, this integration would allow you to </em><em><strong>track your orders </strong></em><em>without having to leave Particl. Another good step towards convenience!</em><br><em><strong>Follow a Vendor: </strong></em><em>This self-explanatory feature will allow you the follow your favorite vendors on the marketplace. The exact implementation hasn’t been decided on, but it is likely that, for privacy reasons, it will be an </em><em><strong>opt-in option</strong></em><em> for vendors to allow their customers to follow them around.</em><br></blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"core-related\">Core-Related</h3><blockquote><em><strong>Latest Bitcoin Codebase:</strong></em><em> As always, we are committed to keeping the Particl codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s. This allows the project to benefit from all the breakthroughs made to the Bitcoin codebase, some of which being directly included into this list.</em><em><strong>RingCT Improvements: </strong></em><em>As stated for a few weeks now, our Lead Cryptographer &#x26; Core Developer, Tecnovert, has been making a few tweaks on the RingCT protocol. These tweaks are specifically intended to make the RingCT protocol </em><em><strong>more private</strong></em><em> than it currently is on other coins’ implementations. Because of the nature of these tweaks, we cannot reveal any detail at this moment as to keep the exclusivity on the improvements.</em><br><em><strong>Bulletproofs: </strong></em><em>The Bulletproofs protocol improvement allows RingCT transactions to be dramatically reduced in size, making them cheaper to send as well as more lightweight on the blockchain. This will greatly help the Particl blockchain to stay as scalable and fast to sync as possible over a long period of time.</em><br><em><strong>Lightning Network:</strong></em><em> The Lightning Network allows transactions to be sent at a near-instant speed and at near-zero cost. The implementation of this protocol is expected to be one of the main areas of focus for Tecnovert this year. It will help with the execution of atomic swaps, the scalability of the network, as well as potentially be made available with private transactions.</em><br><em><strong>Sidechains:</strong></em><em> Another area of interest for 2019, as mentioned by Tecnovert, is the research and development of side-chain solutions for Particl. As defined by </em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/what-are-sidechains-1c45ea2daf3\"><em><strong>HackerNoon</strong></em></a><em>, a “</em>sidechain is a separate <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-versus-traditional-databases-c1a728159f79\">blockchain</a> that is attached to its parent blockchain using a <strong>two-way peg</strong><em>”. No additional information concerning sidechains on Particl is publicly available yet, so stay on alert for more information about this in 2019!</em><br></blockquote><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-3n7YDagbgGqIS5-IMFT9CA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All in all, the South Africa team meeting has been super productive and have really helped pave the way for the next few months to be impactful for the project.

Come and get ‘em!\n\nHow to Get Yours?\nFirst, open Particl Desktop, and navigate to the RECEIVE section and copy your\ndeposit address. Then, get some testnet coins by going to the Particl faucet (\nfaucet.particl.xyz [http://faucet.particl.xyz]) and enter your deposit address\nin the designated space. Now’s the time to order your Particl lapel pin!\n\nOn Particl Desktop, go to the LISTINGS section and locate the Particl lapel pin\nby either scrolling through the listings or searching for it in the\n“Particl — Free Swag” category. Go through the usual process of submitting your\norder, and stay alert for when we will accept your bid.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
