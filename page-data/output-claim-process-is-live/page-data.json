You can now submit your anon and blind outputs\nto the Particl team to re-activate your temporarily disabled coins.\n\nThis blog post details how to submit your claim to the team and provides all the\ninformation you need to know about it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is the Output Claim Process?\nA few months ago, the Particl team discovered and fixed a vulnerability in the\ncode that allowed an attacker to exploit RingCT transactions to create PART\ncoins out of thin air.\n\nTo remedy the situation, the Particl team proceeded to an emergency hardfork and\nset in motion a contingency plan to stop the attacker from doing more damage. As\na result, all coins stored on anon and blind balances have been temporarily\ndisabled.\n\nThe Output Claim Process is how you can submit a claim to the team so that your\ndisabled coins can be re-enabled when the coming hardfork goes live.\n\nFor more information on the exploit, you can refer to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. For a deeper\nexplanation of the solutions deployed, you can refer to this one\n[https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\nSeparate Process From the “Low-Pass Filter”\nTo re-enable anon and blind coins that are temporarily disabled, the team\ndeployed two separate solutions; the Output Claim Process, which this blog post\nis about, and a low-pass filter.\n\nThe low-pass filter is a function that will be enabled on the day of the coming\nhardfork. It will let you re-enable any anon or blind outputs equal to or lower\nthan 200 coins yourself, without the help of the Particl team. In other words,\nif your outputs contain a number of coins equal to or lower than 200, then you\ndon’t need to go through this Output Claim Process and submit a claim to the\nteam to re-enable them.\n\nRequirements to Qualify for the Output Claim Process\nTo qualify for the Output Claim Process, you need to have (1) blind or anon\noutputs containing disabled coins and (2) at least one blind or anon balance\ncontaining more than 200 coins.\n\nHow to Submit Your Claim\n * Access the output claim portal here\n   [https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4].\n\nThe Output Claim Process is powered by the Jira platform. The platform helps to\nstreamline the process and make it more efficient. For added security and\nprivacy, we highly recommend encrypting the data in your claim before submitting\nit on the Jira platform so that only the Particl team can access it.\n\nTo submit your claim, follow these steps.\n\n * Export your outputs in a text file using either Particl Desktop (simplest way\n   to do it) or Particl Qt (advanced users). Learn how to do it by following the\n   instructions just below this list.\n * (Optional) Encrypt the text file created in the step above using the PGP key\n   generated for that purpose (the public key is shown below this step-by-step\n   guide). This will ensure only the Particl team members in charge of the claim\n   process can access your data.\n * Navigate to the Jira portal using your favorite browser. Simply follow this\n   link [https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4]. If you\n   don’t have an account already, create one.\n * Click on “Make a Delegated Output Claim” and fill in the necessary\n   information. Make sure to upload your .txt file containing the required data\n   to re-enable your outputs in the “Attachment” section of the form.\n * Submit your claim by clicking on “Send”.\n * Your claim is now submitted! You can track its progress directly through the\n   portal. Just make sure to note the URL somewhere so that you can refer back\n   to it at a later time.\n\nExport Output Data Using Particl Desktop\n1- Download and install the latest Particl Desktop client here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6].\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v2.3.6 · particl/particl-desktopThis patch release\nincludes some minor usability enhancements.NB!!

It is,\nhowever, important to be aware that it is separated into two phases; the\npre-fork and post-fork phases.\n\nIf you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June,\n2021), then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your\ncurrently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies\nthat your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nKeep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance\nbefore the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the\nactual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase\nis roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.\n\nIf you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021), then\nyou’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs\nre-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at\nthe current time, not scheduled.\n\nOutput Activation Process\nOnce you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to\ndetermine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker. If your claim\nis approved, it will then be added to a whitelist that will specify what outputs\nwill be re-enabled on the day of the hardfork.\n\nAs this process aims to prevent the attacker from moving exploited coins after\nthe hardfork, the only criterion to have your output(s) re-enabled is that it\nnot be owned by the attacker itself.\n\nThe Particl team has developed a tracer script that can help determine whether\nor not outputs are legitimate or exploited, but in some cases, more information\nmay be required. The exact process used to validate outputs will vary on a\ncase-by-case basis depending on various factors.\n\nOnce the Particl team validates a claim, the submitted data will then be\nanonymized and passed on to a second group composed of community members tasked\nwith verifying the validated data. This process is entirely anonymous, meaning\nthe community group can't know who submitted a specific claim. It aims at\nproviding a second security layer to ensure no suspicious or contested claim\ngets approved.\n\nIf a claim would be rejected by either the Particl team or the community group,\nit’ll still be possible for the person making the claim to plead their case to\nthe community by submitting a CCS proposal of their own. Any CCS proposal\nrelated to individual claims will be required to be approved by Particl\nstakeholders through a vote.\n\nData Collection Policy\nData Sharing\nOnly team members directly involved with the Output Claim Process will have\naccess to the submitted data. The data will then be anonymized before being sent\nto the community group for the verification process. The data won't be shared\nwith team/community members not involved in the process or with any third-party. \n\n> Note: Jira is a third-party platform with access to the data uploaded to it. For\nthis reason, we highly recommend encrypting your output data file using the PGP\nkey provided above before submitting your claim.\nData Storage\nThe output data will be securely kept for some time by Particl team members\ndirectly involved with the process as that helps match and validate outputs for\nlate claims. We're looking at a period of roughly one year, after which point\nit'll be deleted entirely.\n\nWhen, exactly, the data will be deleted will be adequately communicated in\nadvance to give late claimers to submit their claims before data that could help\nthem gets deleted. \n\nKeep in mind that once a claim is validated, its associated data will be\nanonymized not to provide a link between the data and which user submitted it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow that the Output Claim Process is officially live, we're getting ready to get\nback to normal and turn the page on this unfortunate event.

It is, however, important to be aware that <strong>it is separated into two phases</strong>; the pre-fork and post-fork phases.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies that your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Keep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance before the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the actual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase is roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current time, not scheduled.</p><h1 id=\"output-activation-process\">Output Activation Process</h1><p>Once you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to determine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker. If your claim is approved, it will then be added to a whitelist that will specify what outputs will be re-enabled on the day of the hardfork.</p><p>As this process aims to prevent the attacker from moving exploited coins after the hardfork, the only criterion to have your output(s) re-enabled is that it not be owned by the attacker itself.</p><p>The Particl team has developed a tracer script that can help determine whether or not outputs are legitimate or exploited, but in some cases, more information may be required. The exact process used to validate outputs will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on various factors.</p><p>Once the Particl team validates a claim, the submitted data will then be anonymized and passed on to a second group composed of community members tasked with verifying the validated data. This process is entirely anonymous, meaning the community group can't know who submitted a specific claim. It aims at providing a second security layer to ensure no suspicious or contested claim gets approved.</p><p>If a claim would be rejected by either the Particl team or the community group, it’ll still be possible for the person making the claim to plead their case to the community by submitting a CCS proposal of their own. Any CCS proposal related to individual claims will be required to be approved by Particl stakeholders through a vote.</p><h1 id=\"data-collection-policy\">Data Collection Policy</h1><h3 id=\"data-sharing\">Data Sharing</h3><p>Only team members directly involved with the Output Claim Process will have access to the submitted data. The data will then be anonymized before being sent to the community group for the verification process. The data won't be shared with team/community members not involved in the process or with any third-party. </p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Jira is a third-party platform with access to the data uploaded to it. For this reason, we highly recommend encrypting your output data file using the PGP key provided above before submitting your claim.</blockquote><h3 id=\"data-storage\">Data Storage</h3><p>The output data will be securely kept for some time by Particl team members directly involved with the process as that helps match and validate outputs for late claims. We're looking at a period of roughly one year, after which point it'll be deleted entirely.</p><p>When, exactly, the data will be deleted will be adequately communicated in advance to give late claimers to submit their claims before data that could help them gets deleted. </p><p>Keep in mind that once a claim is validated, its associated data will be anonymized not to provide a link between the data and which user submitted it.</p><hr><p>Now that the Output Claim Process is officially live, we're getting ready to get back to normal and turn the page on this unfortunate event.

As a result, all coins stored on anon and blind balances have been temporarily disabled.</p><p>The Output Claim Process is how you can submit a claim to the team so that your disabled coins can be re-enabled when the coming hardfork goes live.</p><p>For more information on the exploit, you can refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/\"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>. For a deeper explanation of the solutions deployed, you can refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/\"><strong>this one</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"separate-process-from-the-low-pass-filter-\">Separate Process From the “Low-Pass Filter”</h3><p>To re-enable anon and blind coins that are temporarily disabled, <strong>the team deployed two separate solutions</strong>; the Output Claim Process, which this blog post is about, and a low-pass filter.</p><p>The low-pass filter is a function that will be enabled on the day of the coming hardfork. It will let you re-enable any anon or blind outputs equal to or lower than 200 coins yourself, without the help of the Particl team. In other words, if your outputs contain a number of coins equal to or lower than 200, then you don’t need to go through this Output Claim Process and submit a claim to the team to re-enable them.</p><h3 id=\"requirements-to-qualify-for-the-output-claim-process\">Requirements to Qualify for the Output Claim Process</h3><p>To qualify for the Output Claim Process, you need to have <strong>(1)</strong> blind or anon outputs containing disabled coins and <strong>(2)</strong> at least one blind or anon balance containing more than 200 coins.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-submit-your-claim\">How to Submit Your Claim</h1><ul><li><strong>Access the output claim portal <a href=\"https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4\">here</a>.</strong></li></ul><p>The Output Claim Process is powered by the Jira platform.

It is, however, important to be aware that <strong>it is separated into two phases</strong>; the pre-fork and post-fork phases.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies that your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Keep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance before the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the actual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase is roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current time, not scheduled.</p><h1 id=\"output-activation-process\">Output Activation Process</h1><p>Once you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to determine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker. If your claim is approved, it will then be added to a whitelist that will specify what outputs will be re-enabled on the day of the hardfork.</p><p>As this process aims to prevent the attacker from moving exploited coins after the hardfork, the only criterion to have your output(s) re-enabled is that it not be owned by the attacker itself.</p><p>The Particl team has developed a tracer script that can help determine whether or not outputs are legitimate or exploited, but in some cases, more information may be required. The exact process used to validate outputs will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on various factors.</p><p>Once the Particl team validates a claim, the submitted data will then be anonymized and passed on to a second group composed of community members tasked with verifying the validated data. This process is entirely anonymous, meaning the community group can't know who submitted a specific claim. It aims at providing a second security layer to ensure no suspicious or contested claim gets approved.</p><p>If a claim would be rejected by either the Particl team or the community group, it’ll still be possible for the person making the claim to plead their case to the community by submitting a CCS proposal of their own. Any CCS proposal related to individual claims will be required to be approved by Particl stakeholders through a vote.</p><h1 id=\"data-collection-policy\">Data Collection Policy</h1><h3 id=\"data-sharing\">Data Sharing</h3><p>Only team members directly involved with the Output Claim Process will have access to the submitted data. The data will then be anonymized before being sent to the community group for the verification process. The data won't be shared with team/community members not involved in the process or with any third-party. </p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Jira is a third-party platform with access to the data uploaded to it. For this reason, we highly recommend encrypting your output data file using the PGP key provided above before submitting your claim.</blockquote><h3 id=\"data-storage\">Data Storage</h3><p>The output data will be securely kept for some time by Particl team members directly involved with the process as that helps match and validate outputs for late claims. We're looking at a period of roughly one year, after which point it'll be deleted entirely.</p><p>When, exactly, the data will be deleted will be adequately communicated in advance to give late claimers to submit their claims before data that could help them gets deleted. </p><p>Keep in mind that once a claim is validated, its associated data will be anonymized not to provide a link between the data and which user submitted it.</p><hr><p>Now that the Output Claim Process is officially live, we're getting ready to get back to normal and turn the page on this unfortunate event.

what’s been in the\nworks for the past few weeks and months have finally been deployed. Not only has\nthere been a lot of development and software updates, but the community has gone\nthrough its first-ever on-chain voting, marking a historic moment in Particl’s\nlifetime.\n\nIf you’ve been away, you may have missed some of the news. But don’t worry; this\nupdate report will get you back up to speed with all the major events and\ndevelopments that have happened this month. Let’s get started!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * New Particl V3 Testnet Released\n * Vote for Delegated Output Claim Process Proposal Approved\n * The Output Claim Process is Now Live\n * Vote for Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal Starts Tomorrow\n * Many New Particl Core Releases\n * What’s Coming Next\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Particl V3 Testnet Released\nNew Particl V3 Testnet Builds AvailableDownload, install, and test the brand\nnew\nParticl V3 testnet builds today!Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-v3-testnet-builds-available/]Earlier this\nmonth, a new Particl V3 testnet build was publicly released. You can now test\nthe most recent version of Particl V3 on testnet and help the team spot bugs,\nissues, and areas of improvement.\n\nThe mainnet release of Particl V3 is scheduled for after the coming hardfork.\nThat’s because the Particl Marketplace relies on the RingCT and CT\nfunctionalities of Particl Core which are, at this current time and until the\ncoming hardfork, disabled.\n\nVote for Delegated Output Claim Management Process Proposal Approved\nDelegated Output Claim Management Proposal ResultsThe results are in for the\nOutput Claim Management proposal’s vote!Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/delegated-output-claim-management-proposal-results/]In\nMay, we’ve seen Particl’s first-ever on-chain voting event take place. The vote,\nwhich aimed at either approving or rejecting the Delegated Output Claim\nManagement Process proposal, was passed with a mind-blowing approval rate of\n99.97% and a 63.17% participation rate. Indeed, the vote lasted for 5,040\nblocks, with 3,184 of them voting in favor of the proposal and just one block\nvoting against it.\n\nThis vote marks a historic milestone in Particl’s lifetime and solidifies the\ncurrent move to make the project’s governance more community-powered.\n\nThanks to everyone who’s participated!\n\nThe Output Claim Process is Now Live\nThe Output Claim Process is LiveThe Output Claim Process is now live. Check out\nthis blog post to know how to submit your claim to re-enable temporarily\ndisabled outputs.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/]As a result of Particl’s\nfirst on-chain voting system, the process of managing individual claims seeking\nto re-enable disabled coins has been delegated to the Particl team.\n\nAs such, the Output Claim Process is now live, and you can submit your claim as\nsoon as today. To do so, export your anon and blind output data to a file and\nupload it on the claim platform by following these instructions\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/#How-to-Submit-Your-Claim].\n\nTake note that the first phase of the claim process, the “pre-fork phase”, ends\non the 21st of June, 2021. If you want your currently disabled blind and anon\noutputs to be re-enabled on the day of the coming hardfork, please submit your\nclaim before that date.\n\nVote for Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal Starts Tomorrow\nVote for Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal Starts This WeekThe vote for the\nDecentralized Treasury Model proposal is now scheduled! Find all the\ninformation\non how to vote and when it will start here.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/vote-for-treasury-model-now-scheduled/]In just a few\nhours, Particl’s going to go through another first in its history; the\nfirst-ever protocol consensus changing vote. Indeed, the Decentralized Treasury\nModel proposal’s vote is set to begin and end from block 946,184 to 956,263.\n\nProtocol consensus changing proposals suggest modifications to the protocol or\nother similar significant changes. Because the scope of the proposed changes is\ncritical, this type of proposal requires a more extended voting period (10,080\nblocks instead of 5,040) and a higher approval rate (75% instead of 60%).\n\nTo read more about the Decentralized Treasury Model proposal, check out the CCS\nproposal here [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8].\n\nDon’t forget to set up your node in advance to start voting right from the first\nblock of the voting period.\n\nMany New Particl Core Releases\nReleases · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute\nto particl/particl-core development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]The month of May has\nalso seen its fair share of client releases. We’ve seen 4 Particl Core Releases \n(0.19.2.7 to 0.19.2.10) and the long-awaited second version of the Particl V3\ntestnet. The Particl Core releases mostly deal with issues and improvements\nrelated to the claim process and the coming hardfork.\n\nAs always, it’s highly recommended to keep your Particl Core node up-to-date\nwith the latest version. Check out the Github link above to download the most\nrecent core client.\n\nWhat’s Coming Next\nBut that’s not all; with the upcoming hardfork and the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet, you can expect a few other goodies coming down the road these next few\nweeks.\n\n * The release of the Particl Academy\n * The cutoff date for the claim process before the hardfork\n * The mainnet release of Particl V3\n * A new website to mark the start of a new phase for the project\n * An updated roadmap shortly after the release of Particl V3 on mainnet\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
