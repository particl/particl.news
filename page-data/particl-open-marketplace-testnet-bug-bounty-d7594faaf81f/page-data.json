This build allows you to test the\nnewly introduced “anon” escrow. This escrow system makes all marketplace\ntransactions private-by-default thanks to a combination of the CT and RingCT\nprivacy protocols. This testnet build also contains a vast range of tweaks that\nhave been made to the user interface since the last testnet round.\n\nTo ensure that the code is as stable as it can be and free of any bugs, the\nParticl team is inviting you to participate in a bug bounty where you will be\nrewarded, in PART, if you find any bug within Particl Desktop and the Open\nMarketplace.\n\nSo let’s dive deeper into this bug hunting bounty!\n\n> Note: If any bug is found during this testing round, it will likely be fixed on\nthe spot in internal builds. New builds, batched with multiple bug fixes at\nonce, would then be posted throughout the duration of the bounty, meaning there\ncould potentially be more than one build published during the duration of this\nbug bounty. Reported bugs can only earn you a bounty payment if they’re being\nreported on the latest build publicly available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCatching Bugs\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple:\n\nLatest build version + location of the Report Bug button * Download the latest testnet build of the Open Marketplace. While there is a\n   working testnet version available here\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/], newer builds with\n   fixed bugs may be posted in the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org]. Always verify that\n   you are running the latest build by checking the #testing channel first.\n * Make a backup of your\n   configuration files, especially wallet.dat.\n * Run it on a clean\n   install (delete all your testnet configuration folders, including\n   Particl/testnet, Particl Desktop/testnet, and Particl Market). Please make\n   sure to backup any mainnet wallet.dat file you have before you do.\n * Report any bug or\n   issue by clicking on the bug icon on Particl Desktop. This will take you to\n   Particl Desktop’s Issue page on Github. Users need to follow the proper\n   template that automatically fills the text field when you create a new Issue.\n\nWhat’s Considered a Bug\nA bug is an unexpected behavior that breaks functionality. It needs to prevent\nusers from using a feature to its full extent. It can also be a miscalculation,\na behavior that causes wrong amounts to be transferred, or information that’s\ndisplayed incorrectly.\n\nBugs are separated into 3 categories: minor, medium, and critical.\n\nMinor bug ($25): A minor bug is any small unexpected outcome that doesn’t break\nthe build in any significant way, but still considerably impacts the user\nexperience in a negative way. A minor bug can be annoying, but won’t prevent you\nfrom accomplishing any action within the marketplace.\n\nA good example of a minor bug could be this one here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1619\n\nMedium bug ($50): A significant bug breaks the build or prevents you from\naccomplishing a certain action. They are more than just annoyances, they prevent\nyou from doing an action.\n\nAn example of what a medium bug could look like would be not being able to add\nan item to your cart, prices of items not showing up on any listing or a button\nthat wouldn’t do anything upon clicking on it.\n\nMajor bug ($100): A critical bug is a major issue that not only breaks the build\nand prevents you from accomplishing a task, but that also could result in a loss\nof funds or an incorrectly transferred amount.\n\nAn example of what a major bug could look like would be if the escrow system\nbreaks up and becomes unusable or sends the wrong amounts to the wrong users.\n\nNOTE: The Particl team has sole discretion over what level a bug is categorized\ninto. While the criteria are clear about what makes a bug a minor, medium, or\ncritical one, some bugs may not be as clear cut. In that scenario, Particl\ndevelopers will determine its level.\n\nWhat’s NOT Considered a Bug\nAlthough you may encounter issues, not all of them are considered as bugs. These\nissues may include:\n\n * A typo\n * An improvement suggestion\n * A button is not perfectly aligned\n * A small visual glitch\n * A styling issue\n * A perceived need to change/add buttons\n\nHow to Report an Issue on Github\nFor a bug to qualify for a bounty payment, it has to be properly reported on the\nParticl Desktop’s Issue page on Github and use the proper template that’s\nautomatically generated when clicking on New Issue. This helps developers\nunderstand the issue more quickly and reproduce it on their end so that it can\nbe fixed more rapidly.\n\nTo access Particl Desktop’s Issue page, simply click on the Bug icon located at\nthe bottom left corner of the Particl Desktop wallet. This will automatically\ntake you to the Github page where bugs and issues get reported. Once you are\nthere, simply click the green New Issue button. Alternatively, you can manually\nvisit this Github page by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new\n\n> Note: You will need a Github account to log issues and bugs.\nThe Fine Prints\n * All bug bounties are paid in PART\n * The bug hunting bounty will run for 7 days (from the 1st of August to the 8th\n   of August, 16:00:00 UTC)\n * Only bugs reported on Github using the proper reporting template can qualify\n   for bounty payment.\n * If the same bug is reported more than once, the bounty will be awarded to the\n   first user that reported the issue.\n * The Particl team has sole discretion on what level (minor, medium, or\n   critical) a bug is, and whether an issue is actually a bug or not.\n * Reported bugs need to be from the latest build available. Bugs on older\n   versions aren’t eligible for bounty payment. The latest version can be\n   downloaded from the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org].\n * There is an assessment period for each bug submission. Each reported bug\n   needs to be approved for bounty payment by the Particl team.\n * Payments will be done at the end of the bug bounty\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith that being said, good luck in your hunt for bugs, and see you on mainnet!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Testnet-Bug-Bounty/1-yt8oCJgUcMXk71DqSkOTog.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"earn-part-for-catching-bugs\">Earn PART for Catching Bugs</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Testnet-Bug-Bounty/1-S_fPVIak-t6K7ukw7LoCDA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl just started, on the 1st of August, the final testing round of the Open Marketplace before it moves up onto mainnet.

The Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet on the\n12th of August!\n\nEver since the 16th of July, we have entered in the final mile of the marathon\nthat is the mainnet launch of the Particl Open Marketplace. After years of\ndevelopment, it’s finally ready to be revealed in all its glory, and so let’s\nbreak down how it will play out. Disclaimer, the next few days are going to be\nPACKED!\n\nAugust 1st, 2019\nOn this day, Particl is initiating the last round of testing, on testnet, before\nthe Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet. This build contains all of\nthe bug fixes from the last testing round as well as the integration of the\nfully anon escrow system, powered by a combination of RingCT, CT, and\nsmart-contracts.\n\nA testnet bug bounty of a duration of 7 days also accompanies the testnet\nrelease of the Open Marketplace. This bug bounty rewards testers in PART for\ntrying to break the Open Marketplace, one last time, before it goes onto mainnet\nand gets used with real funds. It ensures the mainnet product will be as stable\nand secure as it can be, and that as little inconvenience and problems arise\nwhen new users start using the marketplace. For more information about the bug\nbounty, follow the link below:\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Testnet Bug Bounty\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple: Download\nthe latest testnet build of the Open…\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\n\nOn top of these two items, an additional bug bounty will permanently be put in\nplace. This permanent bounty is aimed at rewarding users who find bugs,\nexploits, or vulnerabilities in the Particl code to securely disclose issues and\nget promptly rewarded for their hard work. This bounty, just like the testnet\nbounty for the Open Marketplace, ensures that Particl’s code is as secure and\nstable as possible when faced to various attack vectors. For more information\nabout this permanent bug bounty, follow the link below.\n\nhttps://particl.io/bug-bounties/\n\nAugust 3rd, 2019 (from 18:00 to 22:00 UTC)\nParticl’s new Community Manager will run a Google Hangout session on Saturday \nfor anyone wanting to test the latest build of the Open Marketplace on testnet.\nTo celebrate the upcoming mainnet release, 200 PART will be airdropped equally\nbetween all of those who attend the event and complete this set of tasks:\n\n * Participate in the Hangout session\n * Share your screen while testing the Open Marketplace\n * Create a listing and go through the process of selling an item OR purchase an\n   item and go through the entire buy flow\n * Write either your Telegram or Discord username on the Hangout chat so that an\n   admin can contact you later on to get your PART deposit address\n\nTo participate in this Hangout session, follow this link: \nhttps://hangouts.google.com/group/wBjhr58WT4ohYkuN7\n\nNote: Once over, the session will be published on Particl’s Youtube page.\n\nAugust 4th, 2019 (from 14:00 to 18:00, Paris time)\nThe next day, another Hangout session will be held with the Particl FR community\n. This session will use the same concept as the session the day before, but this\ntime will be done in french. This session will also have a 200 PART airdrop\nwhich will be distributed equally among all participants who complete the\nfollowing steps:\nParticipate in the Hangout session\n\n * Participate in the Hangout session\n * Share your screen while testing the Open Marketplace\n * Create a listing and go through the process of selling an item OR purchase an\n   item and go through the entire buy flow\n * Write either your Telegram or Discord username on the Hangout chat so that an\n   admin can contact you later on to get your PART deposit address\n\nTo participate in this Hangout session, follow this link: \nhttps://hangouts.google.com/group/9K81RY78dDSpgukL9\n\nNote: Once over, the session will be published on Particl’s Youtube page.\n\nAugust 5th, 2019\nOn the 5th of August, the Market Key Generation Contest will be over and any\nsubmitted Market Key passed this date will not be accepted as part of the\ncontest. This date will also mark the beginning of the 2-day voting process\nwhere the Particl community will get the pick the one set of Market Keys that\nwill generate the main interface of the Particl Open Marketplace. For more\ndetails about what are Market Keys and how you can participate in the contest,\nfollow the link below.\n\nMarket Key Generation Contest\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60]\nWin a Trezor Hardware Device and a Limited Edition T-Shirt ?\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60]\n\nAfter all, everyone that participates will win a free limited edition Particl\nt-shirt as well as get the chance to win one of the three (3) free Trezor\nhardware wallets being given away to participants. Why not give it a go?\n\nAugust 7th, 2019\nTwo days after the end of the Market Key submission period, at 18:00:00 UTC, the\nvoting period in which the community will pick the set of Market Keys it wants\nto use as the default Market Keys of the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nwill end. This will effectively decide what keys are going to be used once the\nfirst mainnet build of the Particl Open Marketplace will get compiled, and will\ngive Particl Desktop 2.0 its marketplace functionality.\n\nAugust 8th, 2019\nThe Particl Open Marketplace testnet bug bounty will end. The Particl developers\nwill then continue working to fix the identified bugs, if any, for the next few\nhours/days. On the same day, the set of Market Keys selected by the community\nwill be integrated into the codebase of the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nAugust 9th, 2019 - August 12th, 2019\nDuring this period of 4 days, the Particl development team will fix any\nidentified bugs and compile internal builds running on both testnet and mainnet\nto conduct the last round of internal testing. These builds will contain all the\npotential bug fixes resulting from the bug bounty, and will also run using the\ncommunity-generated set of Market Keys.\n\nAugust 12th, 2019 — The BIG Day\nThe 12th of August will be Particl’s biggest day to date. This is when the\nParticl Open Marketplace releases on mainnet, at 12:00:00 UTC. This is the\nmoment everybody’s been waiting for, and it’s just around the corner. Indeed, on\nthis day, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be pushed, with marketplace functionality,\nonto mainnet as a public release.\n\nThis will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services using\ncryptocurrencies in a way that preserves your digital privacy and personal data.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team Gets Shuffled\nBut wait, there’s more! Because the project is now in the middle of a phase\nswitch, the Particl team is getting reshuffled to focus more on Particl adoption\nand community building. This means a few members of the team are getting new\nroles and opportunities.\n\nParticl Gets a New Community Manager\nAugust 1st also marks the day where Particl gets a new Community Manager!\nIndeed, Guillaume Benayoun, most commonly known as Ben within the Particl\ncommunity, will join the team’s ranks as Particl’s Community Manager and\nAmbassador.\n\nBen has been a very active member ever since the very beginning of Particl and\nhas almost single-handedly built the Particl FR community. Ben is also behind \nParticl’s evening of presentations at CoinHouse\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a],\nParis, which took place on the 21st of February 2019. Click the links below to\nwatch the three presentations made on this evening.\n\n * Cold Staking & Cold Staking Pools, by Guillaume Benayoun\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crzskSfKTWk]\n * The Evolution of Global eCommerce, by Lina Seiche\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQrDPzUGYaY]\n * The Role of Intermediaries in Blockchain eCommerce, by Albin Cauderlier\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfUTKTSL2-I]\n\nAs part of his new role within the Particl team, Ben will work on growing the\nmain Particl community and make it more engaging. He will ensure there is always\na team member available to answer questions, moderate the community, and keep\nthe channels clean. Additionally, he will also help on user onboarding and the\ncreation of sub-communities to drive up the adoption of the Particl Open\nMarketplace. As with any other member of the Particl communications team, he\nwill also help in a lot of other areas touching communications.\n\nCryptoguard Gets a New Role\nCryptoguard, Particl’s former Community Manager, will now assume a more strategy\nand communications-focused role within the Particl team. He will take on some of\nPaul Schmitzer’s role in managing communications and crafting the strategies\nsurrounding it. He will still be around the community and work full-time on the\nproject, but this new position will probably mean he will have a more “in the\nbackground” role. Cryptoguard has started working on these new responsibilities\na while ago, hence why getting a new Community Manager that would be entirely\nfocused on the community was necessary.\n\nPaul Schmitzer Gets a New Role\nAs part of this reshuffling on the communications team, Paul Schmitzer will take\non a more strategic and partnership-focused role, assisting Imran in doing some\nof that.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
