Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\n(4:50 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=4m50s]) Could you start communicating a\nbit about the upcoming funding round?\nWe’ve stated in the past that our lead group will be discussing the next funding\nround when we meet later this year. To be honest, we haven’t had any formal\ncommunication on it, only thoughts and ideas were bounced around and we will try\nto share those with the community as they come up. The second funding round will\nbe one of the main talking points of our next team meeting and we’ll have a plan\nof attack after that time.\n\n(6:14 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=6m14s]) You said you want to rise about 20\nmillion USD, you only have around 1 million coins to sell for the second\nfunding round…\nThe numbers that we have gathered over a year history of managing a\ndecentralized team and with a good array of active and future products make us\nfeel comfortable in seeking $20 million in funding. That number, although could\nchange, would be all that is needed to ensure the continuous development of the\nParticl project for as long as people want to use its privacy-focused and\ndecentralized applications.\n\n(8:10 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=8m10s]) I am wondering if the low price of\nthe particl coin is an issue for this funding round\nIn order to raise around $20 million dollars, the price of the Particl coin\nwould indeed need to be at or around 20 dollars. This will be taken into account\nduring our next team meeting when we craft our funding strategy. We may also,\nshould we have enough funds left from the previous funding round, postpone the\nfunding round until more favorable market conditions arise. In other words,\nthere is nothing set in stone yet and we will keep the community updated with\nthe funding structure as we move forward after the meeting.\n\n(9:14 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=9m14s]) How many investors will\nparticipate in this funding round?\nWe have a collection of inquiries that have already voiced an interest and\nreached out to us about the funding round. This will 99% most likely be a\nprivate funding round, not an ICO or community funding event. That will be\nnailed down, as with the rest of the funding strategy, during our next team\nmeeting later this year.\n\n(10:24 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=10m24s]) If we have only one (or a few)\ninvestors, then a very large part of the supply will be held by one (or a few)\nholders. Any thoughts on this?\nWe’ve discussed (again, just brainstorming at this point) having PART lots with\nminimum and maximum buy orders per investment group. For example, a minimum\ncould be 1,000 PART lots or the max could be 10,000 PART lots. We don’t know yet\nhow exactly we’ll be going on about it but it’ll absolutely be done in a manner\nthat respects the integrity of the network, its decentralization as well as its\ncommunity, even if that means ruling our some potential investors that’d be a\nbit a too aggressive in their tactics.\n\n(11:55 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=11m55s]) I think these coins being put in\ncirculation could scare future buyers. Do you plan to set some specific rules so\nthese investors cannot dump their coins on the market?\nWe haven’t talked anything about the terms & conditions of the round. Typically\nprivate investment rounds have rules and participants are less impulsive than\ndaytraders or casual investors. Details will be worked out with our legal teams\ntoo, but again, this has yet to happen. As mentioned above, everything will be\ndone in the most responsible manner possible and will put the integrity and\nhealth of the network first.\n\n(13:57 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=13m57s]) Do you have any kind of plan B\nin case you can’t raise the amount you need?\nThere are two scenarios that could happen. The first one is that we can’t raise\nthe amount we need to and then have to postpone any funding round until the\nmarket conditions (or the investor pool) are more favorable. Note that, as we\nhave secured the salaries and funds required to support the project until at\nleast April of next year, that leaves a lot of time for market conditions to\nturn around and for Particl to turn some heads. It is also far from excluded\nthat these funds could last for longer than that, so in reality, there could\nstill be quite a long time until the moment the project outright requires more\nfunds to survive.\n\nThe second scenario is that the market conditions are more than favorable, we\nraise the amount that we are seeking to raise, but don’t use the full 996,000\nPART coins to do so. This would present more options to improve the network by\npossibly conducting a burn event of the extra PART coins that weren’t required,\nor set up new funds for marketing, community stimulation, development, events,\nphilanthropy, acquisitions, even a fund for future funding rounds, and etc. This\nwould present itself as the ideal scenario as that would give us an unlimited\nnumber of options on how to best spend these leftover funds.\n\n(18:44 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=18m44s]) The word on Discord is that\nstaking pools will be available soon — any information or ETA on that?\nTecnovert has been working on staking pools on both testnet and mainnet\nnetworks. He has gotten rather far so far with it but it is still in testing\nmode. We may be able to see or participate in some of the testing on the testnet\none at some point in time soon.\n\nAs for an ETA, it’s pretty hard to tell as he may very well switch back over to\nRingCT and planning the upcoming hardfork as we near that event. RingCT is ready\nfor mainnet and the governance bit (see the Status Report\n[https://particl.io/status-report] and this tweet\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1037773807145181185]) is moving\nsmoothly.\n\nLong story short, higher priorities may pull him away from staking pools, but\nyes, there are prototypes.\n\n(23:29 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=23m29s]) How is it possible that the\nremaining funds from the first funding round will only last until April 2019?\nTo clarify, the funds going to April 2019 are only salaries which were hedged in\nadvance to ensure that we could pay contributors in the case of any crazy market\nhappenings (see 2018). There is, of course, more funds in the Particl Foundation\ncoffers which could be requested by the Particl team should it need additional\nfundings to cover salaries and operations past April 2019.\n\n(28:46 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=28m46s]) How can one pay for services\nsuch as featuring or highlighting their products on Particl Marketplace?\nThis is not going to be part of the initial version of Particl Marketplace on\nmainnet, but we see this feature as being very useful. It is not something\nthat’s part of our roadmap, yet, and it might come faster if some third-party\ndeveloper builds it using the coming SDK tools, but we might end up tackling it\nourselves at some point in the future. Vendors are going to want tools to\npromote themselves and increase their sales, we are aware of this and will be\nsomething that is most probably end up being part of Particl, whether it’s part\nof Particl Desktop or third-party services like Mubiz\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\n, for example!\n\n(32:31 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=32m31s]) Will the marketplace\nhave reviews?\nThere will probably be reviews and it is planned in some form or another. It’s\nnot part of our roadmap just yet but is something we’ve identified as something\nwe want to work on eventually. There is still a lot of research that needs to be\ndone in order to make it as efficient and accurate as possible (i.e. make it\nharder to fake reviews), and also do so in a way that entirely preserves users’\nidentities.\n\n(34:30 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=34m30s]) Will it have a user reputation\nmechanism?\nIt is still a floating idea, but we may never have a reputation system if it\nproves to be detrimental to one’s privacy/security (since we are, after all, a\nprivacy-focused project). It also might be hard to do without it being able to\nbe gamed by users which would thus make it more or less useless. As we stand\nright now, we are tentatively opting for a model that is going to make use of\ngovernance paired with reviews rather than a “reputation” system.\n\n(39:01 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s]) Does PART have a reorganization\nlimit making long range attacks impossible?\nParticl Proof-of-Stake doesn’t have a reorganization limit. This attack is\nmostly based on weak subjectivity which only works if a bad actor convinced the\nother nodes to download a modified client from a bad source. While they might\nhave the resources to reorganize the blocks, they’d also need to trick people\ninto using their own client and not the official one. This is one of the reasons\nwe very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our \nofficial website [http://particl.io/downloads] or from our Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] as well as always \nverifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files\n[https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads].\n\nMore technical details revealed by Paul here\n[https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s].\n\n(43:36 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s]) Does it have Economic Clustering\nwhich makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the\nchain where the other important nodes are?\n​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically\nincludes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same\nchain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on\nit, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the\nend all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:\n\n> Tecnovert: PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight\nover time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part\nfor a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in\nsuccession. A 500 block reorganization limit (for example) wouldn’t have stopped\nthat though”Dasource “ I agree…I wonder what the other rationale was behind\nit...since most attacks related to stake weight would have been less than a\ndozen blocks in which case it would have never helped as the default setting (in\npre-PoSv3 versions) was 500”\n\nMore technical details revealed by Paul here\n[https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s].\n\n(47:35 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=47m35s]) Is Particl making any effort\ninto researching and improving Proof-of-Stake?\nWhile the team is not solely focusing on working on Proof-of-stake and making a\nPoSv4, we are still improving our own PoS mechanism by making it more secure\nthan most of its counterpart. Cold staking\n[https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc] \nis one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring\nto expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users\nchoose to use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet\n[https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495]\n, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever,\ndramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually\nrequires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the\nstaking process.\n\nThe Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake\nresearch specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on\naround the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if\nnot the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm. Security is, after all, one of\nour core values which are reflected in all aspects of the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Status Report\nA new Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report] was posted on the 31st of\nAugust, highlighting the good development progress made to the project.\n\nParticl.io — Status Report [https://particl.io/status-report/]\n[https://particl.io/status-report/]particl.io\n[https://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nProject Governance (Community Proposals): The Project Governance mechanism\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] is\nnow marked as Completed and has made its way onto the public testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1126].

Mubiz already offers services to\nthe OpenBazaar community and plans on extending its business over to the Particl\nprotocol. In this interview, he reveals how Mubiz will help make Particl as easy\nto use as any other online eCommerce platform by providing a wide range of\nservices such as shipping management, escrow management for buyers (no double\ndeposit required from users), traditional means of payments such as\nbanking/credit cards, Paypal, and etc, reviews, and much more. Don’t miss this\ninterview as it really shows what kind of symbiosis will be possible in the\nfuture between services companies and the Particl protocol!\n\nMeme Contest\n> \nWe announced last week on Twitter that we were holding a Particl meme contest.\nSafe to say, this contest was a tremendous success and we have, so far,\naccumulate well over 125 submissions posted either on Twitter or directly in our\nTelegram/Discord channels! We have been compiling all of your submissions into a\nParticl Forum thread, which we will make available on Monday when the contest\nends! In the meantime, keep the memes coming!\n\nForum Launches on Monday\nHomepage for the Particl ForumYes, you’ve heard that right!

This attack is mostly based on weak subjectivity which only works if a bad actor convinced the other nodes to download a modified client from a bad source. While they might have the resources to reorganize the blocks, they’d also need to trick people into using their own client and not the official one. This is one of the reasons we very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our <a href=\"http://particl.io/downloads\">official website</a> or from our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Github page</a> as well as always <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads\">verifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files</a>.</p><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-43-36-does-it-have-economic-clustering-which-makes-it-possible-for-forgers-to-detect-forks-early-and-switch-to-the-chain-where-the-other-important-nodes-are\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\">43:36</a>) Does it have Economic Clustering which makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the chain where the other important nodes are?</h3><p>​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically includes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same chain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on it, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the end all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:</p><blockquote><strong>Tecnovert:</strong> PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight over time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part for a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in succession. A 500 block reorganization limit (for example) wouldn’t have stopped that though”<strong>Dasource</strong> “ I agree…I wonder what the other rationale was behind it...since most attacks related to stake weight would have been less than a dozen blocks in which case it would have never helped as the default setting (in pre-PoSv3 versions) was 500”<br></blockquote><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-47-35-is-particl-making-any-effort-into-researching-and-improving-proof-of-stake\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=47m35s\">47:35</a>) Is Particl making any effort into researching and improving Proof-of-Stake?</h3><p>While the team is not solely focusing on working on Proof-of-stake and making a PoSv4, we are still improving our own PoS mechanism by making it more secure than most of its counterpart. <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc\">Cold staking</a> is one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring to expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users choose to <a href=\"https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495\">use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet</a>, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever, dramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually requires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the staking process.</p><p>The Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake research specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on around the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if not the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm. Security is, after all, one of our core values which are reflected in <strong>all</strong> aspects of the project.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><p>A new <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">Status Report</a> was posted on the 31st of August, highlighting the good development progress made to the project.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — Status Report</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><em> </em></a><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p><strong>Project Governance (Community Proposals): </strong>The <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism</a> is now marked as <em>Completed </em>and has <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1126\">made its way onto the public testnet</a>.

To be honest, we haven’t had any formal communication on it, only thoughts and ideas were bounced around and we will try to share those with the community as they come up. The second funding round will be one of the main talking points of our next team meeting and we’ll have a plan of attack after that time.</p><h3 id=\"-6-14-you-said-you-want-to-rise-about-20-million-usd-you-only-have-around-1-million-coins-to-sell-for-the-second-funding-round-\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=6m14s\">6:14</a>) You said you want to rise about 20 million USD, you only have around 1 million coins to sell for the second funding round…</h3><p>The numbers that we have gathered over a year history of managing a decentralized team and with a good array of active and future products make us feel comfortable in seeking $20 million in funding. That number, although could change, would be all that is needed to ensure the continuous development of the Particl project for as long as people want to use its privacy-focused and decentralized applications.</p><h3 id=\"-8-10-i-am-wondering-if-the-low-price-of-the-particl-coin-is-an-issue-for-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=8m10s\">8:10</a>) I am wondering if the low price of the particl coin is an issue for this funding round</h3><p>In order to raise around $20 million dollars, the price of the Particl coin would indeed need to be at or around 20 dollars. This will be taken into account during our next team meeting when we craft our funding strategy. We may also, should we have enough funds left from the previous funding round, postpone the funding round until more favorable market conditions arise. In other words, there is nothing set in stone yet and we will keep the community updated with the funding structure as we move forward after the meeting.</p><h3 id=\"-9-14-how-many-investors-will-participate-in-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=9m14s\">9:14</a>) How many investors will participate in this funding round?</h3><p>We have a collection of inquiries that have already voiced an interest and reached out to us about the funding round. This will 99% most likely be a private funding round, not an ICO or community funding event. That will be nailed down, as with the rest of the funding strategy, during our next team meeting later this year.</p><h3 id=\"-10-24-if-we-have-only-one-or-a-few-investors-then-a-very-large-part-of-the-supply-will-be-held-by-one-or-a-few-holders-any-thoughts-on-this\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=10m24s\">10:24</a>) If we have only one (or a few) investors, then a very large part of the supply will be held by one (or a few) holders. Any thoughts on this?</h3><p>We’ve discussed (again, just brainstorming at this point) having PART lots with minimum and maximum buy orders per investment group. For example, a minimum could be 1,000 PART lots or the max could be 10,000 PART lots. We don’t know yet how exactly we’ll be going on about it but it’ll absolutely be done in a manner that respects the integrity of the network, its decentralization as well as its community, even if that means ruling our some potential investors that’d be a bit a too aggressive in their tactics.</p><h3 id=\"-11-55-i-think-these-coins-being-put-in-circulation-could-scare-future-buyers-do-you-plan-to-set-some-specific-rules-so-these-investors-cannot-dump-their-coins-on-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=11m55s\">11:55</a>) I think these coins being put in circulation could scare future buyers. Do you plan to set some specific rules so these investors cannot dump their coins on the market?</h3><p>We haven’t talked anything about the terms &#x26; conditions of the round. Typically private investment rounds have rules and participants are less impulsive than daytraders or casual investors. Details will be worked out with our legal teams too, but again, this has yet to happen. As mentioned above, everything will be done in the most responsible manner possible and will put the integrity and health of the network first.</p><h3 id=\"-13-57-do-you-have-any-kind-of-plan-b-in-case-you-can-t-raise-the-amount-you-need\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=13m57s\">13:57</a>) Do you have any kind of plan B in case you can’t raise the amount you need?</h3><p>There are two scenarios that could happen. The first one is that we can’t raise the amount we need to and then have to postpone any funding round until the market conditions (or the investor pool) are more favorable. Note that, as we have secured the salaries and funds required to support the project until at least April of next year, that leaves a lot of time for market conditions to turn around and for Particl to turn some heads. It is also far from excluded that these funds could last for longer than that, so in reality, there could still be quite a long time until the moment the project outright requires more funds to survive.</p><p>The second scenario is that the market conditions are more than favorable, we raise the amount that we are seeking to raise, but don’t use the full 996,000 PART coins to do so. This would present more options to improve the network by possibly conducting a burn event of the extra PART coins that weren’t required, or set up new funds for marketing, community stimulation, development, events, philanthropy, acquisitions, even a fund for future funding rounds, and etc. This would present itself as the ideal scenario as that would give us an unlimited number of options on how to best spend these leftover funds.</p><h3 id=\"-18-44-the-word-on-discord-is-that-staking-pools-will-be-available-soon-any-information-or-eta-on-that\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=18m44s\">18:44</a>) The word on Discord is that staking pools will be available soon — any information or ETA on that?</h3><p>Tecnovert has been working on staking pools on both testnet and mainnet networks.

This is one of the reasons we very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our <a href=\"http://particl.io/downloads\">official website</a> or from our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Github page</a> as well as always <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads\">verifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files</a>.</p><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-43-36-does-it-have-economic-clustering-which-makes-it-possible-for-forgers-to-detect-forks-early-and-switch-to-the-chain-where-the-other-important-nodes-are\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\">43:36</a>) Does it have Economic Clustering which makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the chain where the other important nodes are?</h3><p>​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically includes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same chain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on it, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the end all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:</p><blockquote><strong>Tecnovert:</strong> PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight over time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part for a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in succession. A 500 block reorganization limit (for example) wouldn’t have stopped that though”<strong>Dasource</strong> “ I agree…I wonder what the other rationale was behind it...since most attacks related to stake weight would have been less than a dozen blocks in which case it would have never helped as the default setting (in pre-PoSv3 versions) was 500”<br></blockquote><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-47-35-is-particl-making-any-effort-into-researching-and-improving-proof-of-stake\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=47m35s\">47:35</a>) Is Particl making any effort into researching and improving Proof-of-Stake?</h3><p>While the team is not solely focusing on working on Proof-of-stake and making a PoSv4, we are still improving our own PoS mechanism by making it more secure than most of its counterpart. <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc\">Cold staking</a> is one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring to expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users choose to <a href=\"https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495\">use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet</a>, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever, dramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually requires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the staking process.</p><p>The Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake research specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on around the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if not the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm. Security is, after all, one of our core values which are reflected in <strong>all</strong> aspects of the project.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><p>A new <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">Status Report</a> was posted on the 31st of August, highlighting the good development progress made to the project.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — Status Report</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><em> </em></a><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p><strong>Project Governance (Community Proposals): </strong>The <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism</a> is now marked as <em>Completed </em>and has <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1126\">made its way onto the public testnet</a>.

In fact, Discourse is a very smooth\nplatform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well\nas enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in\nvarious situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse\nsetup:\n\nStructured Discussions\nThis new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the\ncommunity. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within\nthe community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as\nTelegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with\nyour peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.\n\nParticl Forum’s HomepageIn fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and\nDiscord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation\nthey create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general.\nMoreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at\nsome point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal\nset up, especially when it comes to help & support; different users will often\nbe asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of\nchatter to see if their question has already been answered.\n\nLet’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to\nits full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the\nbigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to\nthe very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to\nprepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users.\nFurthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by\nmillions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not\ncryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms,\nhaving a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something\nthat will make life easier for a lot of people.\n\nCentral Point of Information\nParticl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information\nsurrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki\nalready does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl\norganized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support\nrequired by a user and later marked as solved will be easy to dig back out and\nlink back to any other user having similar issues.\n\nAny article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users,\nand this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help\nnewcomers quickly find the information they are looking for. This is but one\nmore step towards making Particl information more accessible to as many people\nas possible!\n\nHelp & Support\nAmong the many categories that are initially included with the Particl forum is\na Help & Support category. We strongly believe this category to be an absolute\nrequirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much\neasier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll\nweeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported\nour Particl Wiki [http://particl.wiki]’s FAQ into a pinned thread\n[https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2] so that users\ncould easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask\ntheir questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread\nso that it could be added to it upon resolving.\n\nMoreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and\ninstinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the\nmainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will\nbecome a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may\nactually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or\nDiscord.\n\nArchived Discussions\nArchived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl\nforum but are archived on it. The reason these discussions are getting archived\non the Particl Forum [https://particl.community/tags/archive] is that they are\nthought of as constructive, interesting, and in general, adding value to the\nbroader Particl discussion.\n\nAs mentioned throughout this post, many of the platforms we are on (i.e.\nTelegram, Discord, etc) are not ideal when it comes to preserving discussions\nand making them easily accessible. Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a\nmuch more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts,\nhence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for\nall to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.\n\nNote: There is no “Archives” category. We prefer putting every archived\ndiscussion within the category it fits in to make them easier to find. You can,\nhowever, simply select the archive [https://particl.community/tags/archive] tag\nto filter all the forum posts and only display archived posts. To do so, go to\nthe main page of the forum and select archive\n[https://particl.community/tags/archive] as the tag filter.\n\nFor more information about archived discussions, visit this thread: \nhttps://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79\n\nFor a good example of an archived discussions, read What is Dandelion?\n[https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n\nSelf-Governance\nAn interesting feature of the Discourse platform is that it allows, not too\nunlike Particl Marketplace, the community to govern itself. In fact, Discourse\nincludes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide\ninappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching\ntogether trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the\nhighest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them\nto keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users\ntrust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for\nthe most time and have made quality contributions to it.\n\nTo learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article\nposted on the official Discourse blog: \nhttps://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\n\nParticl Proposal Discussions\nAs many of you already know, our development team has been working on the \nProject Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create,\nsubmit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6].\nParticl Desktop does not, however, support proposal discussions. These proposal\ndiscussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus\nreaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about\nthem.\n\nThe Particl forum contains a Proposals\n[https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals] sub-category within\nthe General [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion] category. Because\nParticl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is\nrecommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit\nit to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the\nsubmission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a\nspecific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion\nand for all voters to see.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFun Social Features\nNot only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of fun and\nsocial features! In fact, we’ve added a lot of plugins to the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, including a custom-theme, that makes hanging on the Particl forum a\nreal treat.\n\nUser Cards\nCryptoguard’s User CardUser cards are a small profile summary attached to every\nuser that can be displayed simply by clicking on the user’s avatar. They display\na lot of useful information about the user in question such as social media\nplatform usernames, forum statistics, title, and badges. They allow users to\nquickly preview another user’s profile without requiring to quit the page or\nthread they’re currently on. This is an excellent way to display your forum\nachievements and activity to the rest of the community as well as making\nyourself easier to reach out to on any platform you’re on!\n\nBadges\nA few examples of custom badges made for the Particl forumBadges are forum\n“achievements” you acquire throughout your journey on the Particl forum and are\nmeant to showcase to the rest of the community your involvement within the\nproject. On top of the default badges included in the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, we’ve added a few of them (such as Wiki Contributor, Alpha Tester, \nBug Finder, Coin Swapper, and etc) to highlight some of our own milestones and\ncommunity achievements. They are an excellent way to build a reputation for\nyourself and showcase your support and involvement in the project! For a list of\nthe currently available badges, visit the forum’s badges page\n[https://particl.community/badges]. Note that more badges will be added as we\nmove forward and receive suggestions from the community.\n\nReactions\nYou can react to posts and threads the same way you can do it on Discord or\nSlack. Indeed, on top of the “like” function that comes with the default version\nof Discourse, we’ve added a plugin which allows users to “react” on posts using\nany emojis. Don’t be afraid to show how you feel about a certain post! ?\n\nPolls\nExample of a poll within a threadPolls are going to be useful for anyone that\nwants to poll the community about a certain issue, matter, or question. Up until\nnow, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”),\na set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you\ncouldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was\ngetting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls\nalso do not allow for very complex sets of options.\n\nWith the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced\nby a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a\nforum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private\nsolution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient\n(doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put\nmany options and include much more details) way to do it.\n\nSwap Angels\nBack when the community decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to\naccommodate late swappers\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it was\ndiscussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly,\nreceive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation. As we\nslowly, but surely, head towards the mainnet release of the long-awaited Particl\nMarketplace, we believe that now would be a great time to celebrate our generous\nveteran holders who have donated some of their personal funds to help and rescue\nlate swappers.\n\nAs of today, donors to the initiative will be able to display a special badge, \nflair, title or any combination of those on their profile and user card. These\noptional options can be granted to donors’ Particl forum accounts simply by\nsending a message containing your Particl Portal username as well as whether you\nwould like to be displayed on the Hall of Fame thread or not to Cryptoguard\n[https://particl.community/u/cryptoguard/summary].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Resources\nTutorial\nIf you would like to follow an interactive tutorial that will show you the basic\nfunctions of Discourse, simply read the message from @discobot that you will\nautomatically receive in your inbox upon signing up and follow through his\ninstructions. The bot will guide you through all the basic stuff through an\ninteractive tutorial and help you get started!\n\nDiscourse\nDiscourse’s Official Website [https://www.discourse.org/]\n\nDiscourse Vanilla Features [https://www.discourse.org/features.html]\n\nNew User Tips & Tricks\n[https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-tips-and-tricks/54341/20]\n\nUnderstanding Trust Levels\n[https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/]\n\nFormatting Help [https://commonmark.org/help/]\n\nParticl Forum\nParticl Forum Link [https://particl.community]\n\nArchived Discussions [https://particl.community/tags/archive]\n\nParticl Proposals [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals]\n\nBadges Page [https://particl.community/badges]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo now that you are done reading this introduction post, it’s time to #BePART of\nthe discourse!

Without further ado, let’s dive right in into what this platform is going to bring to the Particl community!</p><p><strong>FORUM LINK: </strong><a href=\"https://particl.community\"><strong>https://particl.community</strong></a></p><hr><h2 id=\"more-details\">More Details</h2><h3 id=\"discourse\">Discourse</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-lCk_rFM_3CbbdQBes3DdXg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.community\">Our new discussion forum</a> is based on <a href=\"http://discourse.com\">Discourse</a>, a slick-looking and high-performance forum platform designed for the modern-day internet. In fact, Discourse is a very smooth platform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well as enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in various situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse setup:</p><h3 id=\"structured-discussions\"><strong>Structured Discussions</strong></h3><p>This new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the community. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within the community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as Telegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with your peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-yaWqiLCzUjOfiIEUk0pU0w.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Forum’s Homepage</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and Discord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation they create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general. Moreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at some point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal set up, especially when it comes to help &#x26; support; different users will often be asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of chatter to see if their question has already been answered.</p><p>Let’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to its full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the bigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to the very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to prepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users. Furthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by millions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not cryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms, having a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something that will make life easier for a lot of people.</p><h3 id=\"central-point-of-information\">Central Point of Information</h3><p>Particl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information surrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki already does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl organized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support required by a user and later marked as <strong>solved</strong> will be easy to dig back out and link back to any other user having similar issues.</p><p>Any article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users, and this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help newcomers quickly find the information they are looking for. This is but one more step towards making Particl information more accessible to as many people as possible!</p><h3 id=\"help-support\"><strong>Help &#x26; Support</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-jZZZIZK1bYf5U8RhPMDc6A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Among the many categories that are initially included with the Particl forum is a <strong>Help &#x26; Support</strong> category. We strongly believe this category to be an absolute requirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much easier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll weeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported our <a href=\"http://particl.wiki\">Particl Wiki</a>’s FAQ into a <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2\"><strong>pinned thread</strong></a> so that users could easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask their questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread so that it could be added to it upon resolving.</p><p>Moreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and instinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the mainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will become a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may actually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or Discord.</p><h3 id=\"archived-discussions\">Archived Discussions</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-C2U3BiLI1zUUQ-TuNdZkRw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Archived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl forum but are archived on it. The reason these discussions are <a href=\"https://particl.community/tags/archive\">getting archived on the Particl Forum</a> is that they are thought of as constructive, interesting, and in general, adding value to the broader Particl discussion.</p><p>As mentioned throughout this post, many of the platforms we are on (i.e. Telegram, Discord, etc) are not ideal when it comes to preserving discussions and making them easily accessible. Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a much more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts, hence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for all to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>There is no “Archives” category. We prefer putting every archived discussion within the category it fits in to make them easier to find. You can, however, simply select the </em><a href=\"https://particl.community/tags/archive\"><em><strong>archive</strong></em></a><em> tag to filter all the forum posts and only display archived posts. To do so, go to the main page of the forum and select </em><a href=\"https://particl.community/tags/archive\"><em><strong>archive</strong></em></a><em> as the tag filter.</em></p><p>For more information about archived discussions, visit this thread: <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79\"><strong>https://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79</strong></a></p><p>For a good example of an archived discussions, read <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78\"><strong>What is Dandelion?</strong></a></p><h3 id=\"self-governance\">Self-Governance</h3><p>An interesting feature of the Discourse platform is that it allows, not too unlike Particl Marketplace, the community to govern itself. In fact, Discourse includes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide inappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching together trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the highest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them to keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users trust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for the most time and have made quality contributions to it.</p><p>To learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article posted on the official Discourse blog: <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\">https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/</a></p><h3 id=\"particl-proposal-discussions\">Particl Proposal Discussions</h3><p>As many of you already know, our development team has been working on the <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create, submit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet</a>. Particl Desktop does not, however, support proposal discussions. These proposal discussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus reaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about them.</p><p>The Particl forum contains a <a href=\"https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals\"><strong>Proposals</strong></a><strong> </strong>sub-category within the <a href=\"https://particl.community/c/general-discussion\"><strong>General</strong></a> category. Because Particl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is recommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit it to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the submission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a specific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion and for all voters to see.</p><hr><h2 id=\"fun-social-features\"><strong>Fun Social Features</strong></h2><p>Not only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of <strong>fun and social </strong>features! In fact, we’ve added a lot of plugins to the vanilla version of Discourse, including a custom-theme, that makes hanging on the Particl forum a real treat.</p><h3 id=\"user-cards\"><strong>User Cards</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-69xOGgawCP1rQiiW3PHrMg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Cryptoguard’s User Card</figcaption></figure><p>User cards are a small profile summary attached to every user that can be displayed simply by clicking on the user’s avatar. They display a lot of useful information about the user in question such as social media platform usernames, forum statistics, title, and badges. They allow users to quickly preview another user’s profile without requiring to quit the page or thread they’re currently on. This is an excellent way to display your forum achievements and activity to the rest of the community as well as making yourself easier to reach out to on any platform you’re on!</p><h3 id=\"badges\"><strong>Badges</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-oQx052TBOHoqACv__u2vLQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A few examples of custom badges made for the Particl forum</figcaption></figure><p>Badges are forum “achievements” you acquire throughout your journey on the Particl forum and are meant to showcase to the rest of the community your involvement within the project. On top of the default badges included in the vanilla version of Discourse, we’ve added a few of them (such as <strong>Wiki Contributor</strong>, <strong>Alpha Tester</strong>, <strong>Bug Finder</strong>, <strong>Coin Swapper</strong>, and etc) to highlight some of our own milestones and community achievements. They are an excellent way to build a reputation for yourself and showcase your support and involvement in the project! For a list of the currently available badges, visit the <a href=\"https://particl.community/badges\"><strong>forum’s badges page</strong></a>. Note that more badges will be added as we move forward and receive suggestions from the community.</p><h3 id=\"reactions\"><strong>Reactions</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-btrSbm84srV6D5wGElfFmg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>You can react to posts and threads the same way you can do it on Discord or Slack. Indeed, on top of the “like” function that comes with the default version of Discourse, we’ve added a plugin which allows users to “react” on posts using any emojis. Don’t be afraid to show how you feel about a certain post! ?</p><h3 id=\"polls\"><strong>Polls</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-KQMgXw7t2FSGWHi8YDbREQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of a poll within a thread</figcaption></figure><p>Polls are going to be useful for anyone that wants to poll the community about a certain issue, matter, or question. Up until now, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”), a set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you couldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was getting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls also do not allow for very complex sets of options.</p><p>With the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced by a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a forum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private solution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient (doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put many options and include much more details) way to do it.</p><h3 id=\"swap-angels\">Swap Angels</h3><p>Back when the community <a href=\"https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a\">decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to accommodate late swappers</a>, it was discussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly, receive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation. As we slowly, but surely, head towards the mainnet release of the long-awaited Particl Marketplace, we believe that now would be a great time to <strong>celebrate</strong> our generous veteran holders who have donated some of their personal funds to help and rescue late swappers.</p><p>As of today, donors to the initiative will be able to display a <strong>special</strong> <strong>badge</strong>, <strong>flair</strong>, <strong>title</strong> or <strong>any combination of those</strong> on their profile and user card. These optional options can be granted to donors’ Particl forum accounts simply by sending a message containing your Particl Portal username as well as whether you would like to be displayed on the Hall of Fame thread or not to <a href=\"https://particl.community/u/cryptoguard/summary\">Cryptoguard</a>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"additional-resources\">Additional Resources</h2><h3 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h3><p>If you would like to follow an interactive tutorial that will show you the basic functions of Discourse, simply read the message from <strong>@discobot</strong> that you will automatically receive in your inbox upon signing up and follow through his instructions.

Particl is consistently ranked\nfirst among privacy coins as well as decentralized marketplaces! CryptoMiso\n[https://cryptomiso.com/], another Github monitoring rating group, currently\nranks Particl in 15th place out of a total of 867 ranked projects within the\nlast 12 months.\n\nWhat if there was a way to visualize Particl’s development history in a more\nuser-friendly way than to manually scan Github stats?\nWith the help of the open-source Github visualizer software Gource\n[http://gource.io/], we produced a series of videos demonstrating the constant\nand impressive work our development team has put into Particl since its\ninception (and the weeks leading up to it).\n\nIn the following videos, you will see visualizations of Particl’s Github\nactivity throughout time. Each moving user you see is a developer that has had\nactivity recorded on one of the displayed repositories. Remember, as we\nconstantly keep our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s, this time-lapse video is\na testament to the cooperation of our 2 teams display. Rather than being in\ncompetition with Bitcoin, Particl is a privacy-focused compliment to Bitcoin,\nand you can see that immediately with both teams represented and developing\nin-step with one another.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Overview of the Particl Network\nLinks: Particl-Core [http://particl-core], Particl-Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop] (market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/market] branch), Particl-Market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market], Partyman (cold staking)\n[https://github.com/dasource/partyman], Copay [https://github.com/particl/copay]\n, OMP-Lib [https://github.com/particl/omp-lib], Atomicswap\n[https://github.com/particl/atomicswap], Particl-Bitcore-Lib\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-lib], Bitcore-Mnemonic, \nParticl-Bitcoind-RPC [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcoind-rpc], \nParticl-Bitcore-Message [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-message], \nParticl-Bitcore-Node [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-node], \nBlue-App-BTC [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc], Particl-Insight-API\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-api], Particl-Insight-UI\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-ui], Partsuite_Partd\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partd], Partsuite_Partutil\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partutil]\n\nWhat Am I Seeing in This Video?\nTecnovert, Particl’s Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer, making some commits\nThis Particl network overview video regroups all of the major development-based\nrepositories, meaning that non-development repositories such as the particl.io\n[https://github.com/particl/particl.io], branding\n[https://github.com/particl/branding], whitepaper\n[https://github.com/particl/whitepaper], as well as a few others are excluded.\nIt shows Particl developers’ Github activity over time. Each moving user is a\nGithub user that has contributed to one of the listed repositories, and each\n“ray” being shot from these users is a contribution. Furthermore, we have\nhighlighted Particl developers so that their names and pictograms appear in\ngreen whereas Bitcoin Core developers appear as a white/grey name color.\n\nEach “node” represents a folder within one of our repositories and their link to\nother folders are identified by “branches”. Every folder within the same\nrepository is represented under the same “master branch”.\n\nNote: None of these visualizations displays all the work done by the development\nteam. Indeed, each repository is represented by a single Git branch, meaning\nthat work accomplished on other git branches is not reflected in the animation.\nFor example, Particl Desktop’s visualization is set up on the “market” branch,\nwhich is the most up-to-date but doesn’t display the work being done on the \nfeature-multiwallet-v2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/feature/multiwallet-v2] and \nproposals [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/proposals] branches\n(see active branches here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/branches]\n).\n\nObservations\nWhat is particularly interesting to notice is just how much the Bitcoin Core\ndevelopers are contributing, indirectly, to the Particl project. In fact,\nbecause we constantly update our codebase to match the latest version of Bitcoin\nCore, we benefit from all the ongoing research and development going on over the\nBitcoin network.\n\nMoreover, keeping our codebase up-to-date not only grants the Particl blockchain\nwith all the security, performance, stability, privacy, and utility enhancements\nmade to the Bitcoin blockchain, but it also enables our development team to fork\nany interesting Bitcoin product and adapt it to work over the Particl network.\n\nParticl Copay, our mobile wallet currently available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay&hl=en] and for \ndesktops [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases], is a great example and\ndemonstration of this concept. In fact, Copay [https://github.com/bitpay/copay] \nhas initially been developed by Bitpay [https://github.com/bitpay] and was\ndesigned to be a Bitcoin-only mobile wallet. It was, however, forked by the\nParticl development team to give its community an easy-to-use mobile wallet that\ncould also double as a tool to generate and use Particl multi-signature\naddresses, a feature that, to this day, is still only available on Particl\nCopay.\n\nParticl Desktop & Particl Market From Up Close\nWe’ve also isolated three of the repositories shown in the Particl Network\nvisualization and zoomed in to show in greater details the work being\naccomplished. These three repositories are the three main ones in the project\nand are the ones which are being developed the most to accomplish our vision.\n\nParticl Desktop\nParticl Market\nParticl Core in Comparison to Bitcoin Core\nIn the video above, you can compare both Bitcoin’s (left) and Particl’s (right)\ncore codebases. This visualization really highlights the relentless work\naccomplished by our Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer Tecnovert as he adds\nfeatures on top of the Bitcoin codebase at a record speed while constantly\nkeeping Particl’s codebase version in sync with that of Bitcoin’s.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Development-Timeline-Video/1-QqvirCy91HiCO2ToI4Il9Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The Particl project has now been around for around 14 months.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology.
