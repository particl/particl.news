So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've been making good progress on integrating the now-completed changes planned\nfor 3.3 into the desktop client. While the work continues, it is now progressing\nat a steady pace.\n\nNew \"Core\" section redirects to the newly-added Core-related settings (UI/UX is\na WIP)Now for a bit more information on the screenshot above.\n\n 1. Clicking on the \"Core\" button brings up the core configuration screen,\n    allowing the user to change various core-related settings. Things like\n    connection details (URL, whether to use the core cookie file for\n    authentication or provided RPC user/password, etc.), whether to start core\n    on PD startup or not, which network to connect to (mainnet, testnet, or\n    regtest), proxy details (i.e., Tor), etc. Those are generally saved in an\n    app-specific (wallet, market, etc.) JSON file, meaning that one can script\n    the download, configuration, and startup of Particl Desktop for specific\n    environments such as Whonix, for example.\n 2. In the screenshot, the core status message below the buttons shows that core\n    is connected. If core was not already connected, then the other buttons\n    would not be active. In other words, one cannot open the marketplace unless\n    core is actively running.\n 3. A new icon in the sidebar allows the user to navigate back to the welcome\n    screen from anywhere. Currently, it looks like a hamburger menu icon, but\n    we'll change it to a more comprehensible icon before the release.\n\nWhile the back-end changes are now complete, integrating them into the user\ninterface is our current main and final desktop-related deliverable before we\ncan go live with PD 3.3. Of course, as is always the case with larger releases,\nwe'll run a testnet round before the mainnet deployment.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]As part of BasicSwap's\nongoing development process, we are still working on and pushing a variety of\nback-end improvements to the DEX protocol as we progress on its GUI. \n\nThis week, we've had the notable addition of a display for XMR viewkeys on the\nbid page. We've also seen a few other minor additions, which can be tracked by\nfollowing the DEX's repository on Github\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]. \n\nAdditionally, we've added simple notes that detail how private or secret swaps \ncan be done between two users without ever putting an offer on the books.\nObviously, this specific type of private order requires the two parties to find\neach other and agree on the trade terms on an external platform. What this\nfeature allows them to do is safely execute a trade without the need for them to\ntrust each other or use a middleman. Perfect for private OTC deals!\n\nBasicSwap DEX's Beta Status ?\nAlthough we will very soon release BasicSwap's open beta to the public, it's\nimportant to remember that it is still beta software. That means its development\nis still ongoing and there may be missing features or areas in need of\nimprovements. \n\nAs such, we're thrilled with the amount and level of community discussions,\nquestions, and general curiosity we've observed about BasicSwap lately. \n\nThis is precisely what we're looking for moving ahead with the open beta, and we\nwant to channel that energy to improve the platform more quickly. \n\nThat's why we will need as many people as possible to test the system, make\nswaps, and try to break it. Every single bit helps, and we're about to get\nstarted. As we begin the final phase of closed beta testing on Tuesday, stay\ntuned for the announcement of the open beta launch, which should follow shortly\nafter that.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
