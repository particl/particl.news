\ndecentralized marketplace\n[https://particl.news/week-in-review-official-particl-swag-being-purchased-on-alpha-market-testnet-9bbf8c96d383]\n.\n\nIf you were part of that group then keep an eye for your official Particl swag\nin your post.\n\nBuying real products in a testing environment\nNaturally a product like Particl Marketplace, in its early testing phases, on\nthe test network, using test PART coins would populate with a bunch of\ntest/pretend listings for test/pretend products, etc. It’s essential to test all\npossible parameters vendors and customers might encounter when using the\ndecentralized marketplace.\n\nWe are getting even faster and more accurate metrics with actually offering real\nproducts in this environment.\n\nReal products like our Particl t-shirts placed for sale have an inherent mission\nin life — to be paid for, contracted in escrow, mailed out and delivered. Test\nlistings with pretend items are merely posers that can mask vital steps in our\neCommerce checkout process because real results (shipments) aren’t expected.\n\nWaiting on your order?\nSo our first batch of shirts has gone out and with those orders a bunch of\nvaluable issues have been logged to help boost the shopping experience on\nParticl Marketplace. Thank you!\n\nWe are going to re-open the official Particl storefront and shirt listings this\nweek and begin taking some new orders. If you have an order in and it is still\nshowing “Bidding” you’ll want to make a new order when we give the go ahead in\nour social channels.\n\nCurrent Inventory\nOur first batch of branded tees are going fast but we’ll be giving away shirts\nthroughout the testing phase of the Marketplace, so no worries if you don’t make\nthe first round. Alpha doesn’t provide timestamps for orders nor does it give\nthe option to remove past items bid on but not accepted. Have patience, these\nare free giveaways for testers, you’ll love them when you get them!\n\nWe have new Particl emblem pins!\nA special shout out goes to a vendor who goes by ICOsensei on Twitter.\n\n> \nWe received a shipment of 50 Particl branded lapel pins from ICOsensei\n[https://twitter.com/ICO_sensei] last week and we have permission to offer these\nas products on the Alpha Marketplace.\n\nThese are really well made pins for all cryptocurrency collectors out there.\n\nMore Vendors\nIt’s cool getting free stuff right? Have a favorite coin that gives away shirts,\nstickers, coffee mugs? Give them a shout out, share a link to our Particl\nDesktop with Alpha Marketplace on testnet and put them in contact with the team.\n\nGoing halfsies with real products like ICOsensei’s lapel pins (which they paid\nfor inventory and we pay for shipping) helps promote the project and marketplace\nand also helps us find better experiences in our shopping dapp we’re building.\n\nHow cool would it be to buy some of your favorite coin project shirts like PIVX,\nKomodo, Decred on the Particl Marketplace with test-PART? Remember that our\nvision for the Marketplace is that it’s a use case for these projects and many,\nmany more. The doors could be opened for future integrations with free project\nswag on the Particl Alpha Marketplace.

The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to\nbuild trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly\nprivate?\n\nOne of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with\nwhom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than\nthey ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get\nour data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have\nspecifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable\npractices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make\nmoney out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the\nvery people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit\nthe servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to\nanother company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard\nto keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for\nwhat purpose.\n\nWhy Does It Even Matter?\n“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically\ncommodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users\nfrom whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified\nabout it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for\nfree while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads? Nothing is\nfree on the internet, companies exist for the sole purpose of making profits and\nhuge websites have huge maintenance costs. When a platform appears as free, it\nis most likely because you are making “personal data payments”.\n\n * “Data is the new oil” — Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC\n   Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of Move Fast and Break Things: How\n   Google, Facebook, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\n\nOn one hand, this “data economy” is good for partner companies that can then\nmake their products and platforms arguably better for their users. The ability\nfor them to know who exactly is using their platform allows them to make a much\nmore customized and personal experience. But on the other hand, things can get\nugly quickly.\n\nMaking money off your back\nThe most common and recurring concern from the public when it comes to personal\ndata sharing is the fact that companies are making millions if not billions\nreselling every single detail of our private lives to whoever is willing to pay\nfor it. Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken\nfrom, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where\nit is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly\nkept in the dark even though it affects them directly.\n\nNo consent\nAs it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what\nhappens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares\nit with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their\npersonal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly\naffect anybody is with the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal. In that particular\nscenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data\nanalytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the\nRepublican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words,\nevery Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their\npolitical rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so\nunwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has\ngone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude\nreality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you,\nwith or without your consent or knowledge.\n\nIn the wrong hands\nWhen you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only\ntrust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it\nsecure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very\nvaluable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the\nexponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal\ndata as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit\ncard numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals\nconstantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of\nthumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from\nits users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that\nyou are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain\ncontinuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being\nbreached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other\ncompanies.\n\nKeeping your private life private\nOne of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact\nthat privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice\nto keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like\nit. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality\nservice without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.\n\n> “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing\nto hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you\nhave nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden\nThe GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?\nA couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when\nthe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into\neffect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses\nthe sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give\ncontrol to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified\nand stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies\nclearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they\nwill do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as\nto how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it\nsecure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the\nprotection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.\n\nDo we really have a choice?\nIn the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the\nnew terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new\nterms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In\nsome cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative\nservices that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an\nundertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users\ncould lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even\ncontact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to\naccept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece\nof software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are\nnow owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or\nApple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their\nwide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a\nrather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior\nuser-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people\nwill accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information\nto the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.\n\nYou still need to trust them!\nSecondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or\nincompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should\nthey misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will\nnever happen, as was evidenced by the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal in which Facebook\nseemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal\ndata. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get\nhacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their\nterms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data\ntheft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of\nregulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases,\nsucceed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.\n\nThe Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers\nIn the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an\nopportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only\nvery recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new\ntechnologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous\nsection, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the\ncompany behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your\npersonal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the\nneed to trust a third-party? There actually is!\n\nBlockchain technology allows two or more users to directly exchange data without\nthe use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular\nuse-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as\nBitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached\nto it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone\nin the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a\npayment processor or a company.\n\nHowever, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual\ncurrencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be\nused to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called\ndecentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with\neach other without any third-party or company running the software. It is\npossible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could\nbuy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company\nlike Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but\ntaken a step further.\n\nIs Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?\nYes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the\nworld in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some\ndrawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are \npublic and permanent data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever\nbe publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain\ntechnology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is\nnot. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while\ntransactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to\ncryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user\nidentities can be revealed.\n\nThe case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being\nstored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain\nanalysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and\ngovernmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on\ntracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s\nDepartment of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense\n(military) contractor, in as early as 2016\n(https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/).\nThis, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly\nvisible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public\ntransactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or\npresent analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really\nwant our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone\ninterested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become\npowerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain\nsomeone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech\ngiant like Amazon.\n\nTaking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level\nThe blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly\nshare data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in\nterms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and\nmade private-by-design, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved\nif combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?\n\nPrivacy-focused blockchains are good…\nThe first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers\nuntraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data\ntransactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and\ngroundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where\ntransactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts,\nparticipants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and\nzero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles.\nNote that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency\ntransactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.\n\nPrivate-by-design blockchains are even better!\nTo be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be\nmandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an\nopt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having\nopt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made,\nthus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more\nsuspect.\n\nNot everything needs to be stored on-chain\nBlockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s\nnot ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound\nfiles, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in\nthere permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the\nentire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage\nboth a scaling and security nightmare.\n\nIt is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that\nuse the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their\naccompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that\nthese P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not\nentirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of\na decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized\nstorage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It\ncould then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and\nbe configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after\npre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the\n“amnesic” properties.\n\nIt’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!\nAnother security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to\nprotecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact,\nmost blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed\nconnection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers,\nmaking it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection\ninformation.\n\nAgain, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing\nbecomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a\nsmall portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking\nsuspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re\nstronger”!\n\nThe Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality\nWith the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable\noption, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application\nplatform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy\nparameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves\nquite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any\ncurrency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS,\nBlockstack, etc).\n\nThe project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design\ndecentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services,\nand is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized\napplications very user-friendly. The project is built on the foundation of\nprivacy and security, and as such is having its breakthrough privacy protocol\n(RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase) reviewed for any flaw by the NJIT Department of\nTechnology.\n\nParticl aims at decentralizing popular web services as well as the\ncryptocurrency ecosystem and making them private-by-default, heralding a new,\nsecure, private and trust-less way for people to use the internet while keeping\ntheir private life provably private.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Case-for-Privacy-in-the-Tech-Industry/1-kjhAZ5nvH9SnqAZGsTCyrQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data.

Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken from, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where it is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly kept in the dark even though it affects them directly.</p><h3 id=\"no-consent\"><strong>No consent</strong></h3><p>As it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what happens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares it with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their personal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly affect anybody is with the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal. In that particular scenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data analytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the Republican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words, every Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their political rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so unwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has gone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude reality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you, with or without your consent or knowledge.</p><h3 id=\"in-the-wrong-hands\"><strong>In the wrong hands</strong></h3><p>When you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only trust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it secure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very valuable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the exponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal data as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit card numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals constantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of thumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from its users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that you are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain continuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being breached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other companies.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-your-private-life-private\"><strong>Keeping your private life private</strong></h3><p>One of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact that privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice to keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like it. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality service without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.</p><blockquote>“Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-gdpr-a-step-in-the-good-direction-but-is-it-enough\">The GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?</h2><p>A couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into effect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses the sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified and stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies clearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they will do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as to how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it secure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the protection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-really-have-a-choice\"><strong>Do we really have a choice?</strong></h3><p>In the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the new terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new terms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In some cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative services that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an undertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users could lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even contact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to accept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece of software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are now owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their wide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a rather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior user-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people will accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information to the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.</p><h3 id=\"you-still-need-to-trust-them-\"><strong>You still need to trust them!</strong></h3><p>Secondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or incompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should they misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will never happen, as was evidenced by the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal in which Facebook seemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal data. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get hacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their terms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data theft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of regulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases, succeed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.</p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-do-away-with-trusting-strangers\">The Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers</h3><p>In the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an opportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only very recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new technologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous section, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the company behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your personal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the need to trust a third-party? There actually is!</p><p><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> allows two or more users to directly exchange data without the use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular use-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached to it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone in the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a payment processor or a company.</p><p>However, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual currencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be used to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called decentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with each other without any third-party or company running the software. It is possible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could buy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company like Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but taken a step further.</p><h2 id=\"is-blockchain-technology-really-better-at-keeping-your-private-data-private\">Is Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?</h2><p>Yes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the world in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some drawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are <strong>public</strong> and <strong>permanent</strong> data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever be publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain technology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is not. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while transactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to cryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user identities can be revealed.</p><p>The case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being stored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain analysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and governmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on tracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s Department of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense (military) contractor, in as early as 2016 (https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/). This, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly visible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public transactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or present analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really want our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone interested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become powerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain someone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech giant like Amazon.</p><h2 id=\"taking-blockchain-technologies-to-the-next-level\">Taking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level</h2><p>The blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly share data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in terms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and made <strong>private-by-design</strong>, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved if combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?</p><h3 id=\"privacy-focused-blockchains-are-good-\"><strong>Privacy-focused blockchains are good…</strong></h3><p>The first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers untraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data transactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and groundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where transactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts, participants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and zero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles. Note that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency transactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"private-by-design-blockchains-are-even-better-\"><strong>Private-by-design blockchains are even better!</strong></h3><p>To be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be mandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an opt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having opt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made, thus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more suspect.</p><h3 id=\"not-everything-needs-to-be-stored-on-chain\"><strong>Not everything needs to be stored on-chain</strong></h3><p>Blockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s not ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound files, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in there permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the entire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage both a scaling and security nightmare.</p><p>It is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that use the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their accompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that these P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not entirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of a decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized storage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It could then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and be configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after pre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the “amnesic” properties.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-not-only-about-transactions-and-uploaded-data-\"><strong>It’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!</strong></h3><p>Another security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to protecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact, most blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed connection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers, making it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection information.</p><p>Again, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing becomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a small portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking suspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re stronger”!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-project-is-making-that-vision-a-reality\">The Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality</h2><p>With the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable option, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application platform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy parameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves quite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any currency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS, Blockstack, etc).</p><p>The project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design decentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services, and is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized applications very user-friendly. The project is built on the foundation of privacy and security, and as such is having its breakthrough privacy protocol (RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase) reviewed for any flaw by the NJIT Department of Technology.</p><p>Particl aims at decentralizing popular web services as well as the cryptocurrency ecosystem and making them private-by-default, heralding a new, secure, private and trust-less way for people to use the internet while keeping their private life provably private.\n\n</p>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"8b8f1175-b758-44c7-93aa-fefa66c3b097","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f76820","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Case-for-Privacy-in-the-Tech-Industry/1-kjhAZ5nvH9SnqAZGsTCyrQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data.

The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to build trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly private?</p><p>One of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with whom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than they ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get our data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have specifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable practices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make money out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the very people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit the servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to another company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard to keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for what purpose.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-it-even-matter\">Why Does It Even Matter?</h2><p>“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically commodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users from whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified about it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for free while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads?

That’s important to consider if you’ve placed a bid on one\nof the shirts and you’re wondering the next steps.\n\nBidding\nItems in your cart that you have placed a bid on to purchase will have the “\nBidding” label.\n\nThe label means you’ve sent a desire to purchase the item to the seller and the\nball is now in their court. The same “Bidding” labeled box shows up in the\nSeller’s order book.\n\n> Important: If you have placed a bid on an official shirt and you still see the\nbox labeled “Bidding” then I missed seeing your bid and you should place another\nbid. As I said, the queue I can see in my order book is cleared on my end and\nnow awaiting buyers to actually purchase the items and put it into “Escrow”.\nIn this Alpha version of the Particl Marketplace all bids last 48 hours. So I\nmight have missed your order if you placed it immediately after launch. Please\nplace another order so we can get you your shirts!\n\nAwaiting\nWhen a seller has accepted your bid then the order book displays the “Awaiting”\nlabel. Now the ball is back in your court to actually purchase the item; hence\nwhy the seller is waiting.\n\n * Recall the info-graphic above to see entire process.\n\nIt’s ok! This is a new experience. This is a good example of starting something\nnew in a testnet environment. With a little guidance I hope the process seems\nlogical and with practice it should become easy and understandable.\n\nNow, like I’ve said, I’ve cleared my queue as of this article.

Here are the direct voting results:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Pql4JWe had a fairly decent organic voting turnout — a\nlittle manipulation [speculating ?] — but good participation just the same. A\ntotal of 376 ballots were submitted and all the designs received some votes!\n\nFinalizing Top 10\nSince this is the community’s contest we wanted to make sure the Top 10 truly\nrepresented a fun collection of the best designs and equally lets the most\namount of designers into the Top 3 voting round.\n\nAfter consulting with you guys we all decided to eliminate 5 designs that\nreceived some of the most votes — but would give us trouble with copyright\ninfringement or print-ability — and included down to the top 15 by votes.\n\nWho’s in?\nWhile all the designs submitted hit the target for creativity and taking a new\nspin the Particl brand, these 10 stood above the rest. These are you designs\nmoving into the next round of voting!\n\n> High Resolution gallary for Top 10 designs: https://imgur.com/a/1q0ZP\nWho’s out?\nThese designs are amazing but are being eliminated because of copyright and/or\nprint-ability issues. I know we have some t-shirt printing shops in our\ncommunity that have the ability to do a wider range of printing than we can for\nthis contest… I imagine you may see these or more show up in some storefronts on\nParticl Marketplace in the future.\n\nRound 2 Voting Starts Today!\nYou have helped us pick the Top 10 out of 59 amazing designs.

We’ve identified\nimportant items that are focus features over the next 6 months and beyond but\naren’t tying these to quarters as we did in our Roadmap v1.2\n[https://particl.news/project-update-november-8th-2017-c0437292e1f8].\n\n*New items can be added or taken away at anytime, this is a living document.\n\nIN PROGRESS:\nWith the release\n[https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-0-1-1dad242b075] of Particl Core\n0.16.0.1 the development team debuts a couple features that they have been\nworking on.\n\nSupport for Hardware Signing Devices\nParticl Core 0.16 introduces generic support for Hardware Signing Devices to\nprovide key-signing capabilities.\n\nLedger Integration\nInitial support for the Ledger Hardware Wallet is here!\n\nThis has not yet been extended to blind or anon tranactions and therefore\ncurrently cannot be used exclusively for all functions of the wallet. Support\nwill continue to be extended in future versions.\n\nStealth Addresses V2\nIn order to facilitate deterministic generation of stealth addresses between\nParticl Core and Signing Devices the method used to generate these addresses had\nto be changed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Marketplace (MP)\nThe majority of our team will be focused on the private decentralized\nmarketplace over the next 6 months. We are readying our Alpha release of the\nParticl Marketplace as I write this.\n\nALPHA is the long-awaited decentralized marketplace dApp within Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.io/downloads/]. The Alpha release of the marketplace will be\nbarebones to start as users begin to test and progress through the\nbuying/selling process.\n\nAs more users onboard we’ll continue refining the user experience and the tools\navailable to vendors and shoppers.\n\nListing Governance\nGovernance won’t be in our initial release of the Markeplace but is one of the\nitems in the pipeline this year. The vision of the Particl Project is to be a\nprivacy focused platform for decentralized applications.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is being built to be self-sustaining, self-governing and\ncompletely decentralized. Governance is a huge piece of the puzzle that the team\nwill be focused on developing to protect privacy and protect users.\n\nSoftware Development Kit (SDK)\nA plan to have a SDK for developers is in the pipeline. The SDK will allow the\ncreation of applications within the Marketplace or Desktop.\n\nThis might not come in 2018 from the Particl team (it is a pipeline item in the\nfuture) but could be a community development item someone takes on as a side\nproject to create. The full support of the dev team will be available to anyone\nwanting to contribute and help speed of delivery of valuable items.\n\n> A software development kit is typically a set of software development tools that\nallows the creation of applications for a certain software package, software\nframework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating\nsystem, or similar development platform. — Wikipedia\nZMQ for MP Messages\nShort for ZeroMQ [http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#-MQ-in-a-Hundred-Words],\nthis is an automated messaging system that allows messages and notifications to\nbe automatically pushed to Particl Desktop. An example would be if Particl\nDesktop has an update available, ZMQ will push notification to Particl Desktop\nand users will see a notice a new version of the Desktop is available.\n\nBETA Marketplace\nOur next major release of the decentralized marketplace will be BETA.\n\nBeta MP may or may-not be a mainnet viable product. It is too early to tell but\nis something the team will be transparent in communicating.\n\nFactors such as Governance and privacy (RingCT) are big factors on whether a\nmainnet marketplace is available in the next 6 months on mainnet. 50/50 is the\nbest bet at the moment; being completely honest and forthcoming.\n\nA Beta marketplace release with governance but without RingCT could happen with\nour Confidential TX’s (CT) already providing privacy on mainnet. CT do a good\njob of hiding amounts (MAD escrow) but don’t provide complete privacy for\naddresses of vendors and buyers in a escrow contract.\n\nPrivacy and Governance are 2 of the major factors that ultimately will determine\nthe BETA marketplace release in the coming 6 months.\n\nFull Particl Marketplace Release\nAll versions of the MP leading up to full release will be testing versions and\nlive versions with new features introduced at each release. Once RingCT is on\nmainnet, Governance is fully developed, and currency-agnostic options like\ncross-chain atomic swaps/integrations have been through the proper testing\nenvironment we’ll plan a Full Particl Marketplace Release.\n\nThis will be the truly private decentralized marketplace that will disrupt the\nway you buy and sell online.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRing Confidential Transactions (RingCT)\nSpeaking of privacy and RingCT, we will see some exciting movement on this\nprivacy enhancement in the next 6 months.\n\nAcademic Review\nIf you aren’t aware, NJIT research Qiang Tang [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/] is\nleading a group in a review of our RingCT privacy on Particl Testnet. Particl\nFoundation created a grant with the university in Sept. 2017 for this research,\nQiang’s lab received the grant money in Nov. 2017\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#activities] and began working on a 6 month review\nin Dec. 2017.\n\nThey are 3 months into review and will provide the foundation with a report\nafter 6 months on the privacy, cryptography and security recommendations for\nParticl’s RingCT implementation on the latest Bitcoin codebase.\n\nBulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions\nA very exciting paper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] was released in\nthe middle of our grant with Qiang (NJIT) that significantly reduces the burden\nof confidential transactions on the blockchain.\n\n> Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing\nproposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nParticl is the only Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency with Confidential Transactions\nlive and available today. We don’t allow CT to be default because of the\nsize/cost this privacy introduces to transactions. Here is an infographic you\nmay have seen showing the size/cost of each level of privacy for PART.\n\nYou can see that transaction size of CT and RingCT are 20x that of the\npseudo-anonymous “public” state most users default to.\n\nBulletproofs is a big development that we will be reviewing this year. We\nestimate research, development, implementation and testing will be a 3–4 month\npart-time assignment for Tecnovert, Particl Lead Core Developer.\n\nRingCT — Mainnet\nIt is fair to give a realistic checklist of the steps needed to see RingCT on\nParticl Mainnet in the coming months.

His\ngoal was to tap into the video blog genre to help promote Particl, as well as\nprivacy rights, decentralized ecommerce and financial freedom (individual\nsovereignty).\n\nWe are excited to bring Desi-Rae on to exclusively cover Particl and also\nsupport her research into other benefits blockchain tech and the space can lead\nus in the future.\n\nI had a chance to ask her some questions about her background and passions\nrecently.\n\nPS: You have an academic process by how you learn and then present your content.\nWhat is your background?\n\nDRC: My background is in scientific research and data collection, as well as\nvisual art, specifically oil painting. I studied Biology and Studio Arts in\nschool and have always been interested in many things and the process of\nlearning itself. As you can possibly tell from my videos, I enjoy encountering\nsomething new and then finding out more about it, particularly by doing research\nthat provides data to answer a question. But I am also interested in the\naesthetic environment of a presentation, in terms of visuals, tone and mood, and\nnot only the presentation of the actual information.\n\nPS: How did you get into the cryptocurrency space?\n\nDRC: I got into the cryptocurrency space through osmosis. I knew and followed\npeople who were interested in cryptocurrency. I had a minimal amount of interest\nin the technology behind it. This is in the sense that I like to understand how\nthe world around me works, and not be ignorant of the basic functioning of many\nthings that I come to rely upon and use. However, I may not know how to build\nsomething myself. I was also drawn into the cryptocurrency space through the\nappeal of investing long term for financial gain, something which is in some\nways barred from individuals who are not already in the financial world due to\nhow the law handles those kinds of scenarios.\n\nPS: What type of content do you want to bring to the Particl community and the\ncryptocurrency space in general?\n\nDRC: I want to bring content to the cryptocurrency space that makes people\ncurious, engaged, and hopefully enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. There is a\nlot of content available for anyone who wants to learn. Really, there are video\nseries and lectures, from any standpoint, such as knowing how to code,\nunderstanding how blockchains or features of a cryptocurrency work, figuring out\nhow to trade or invest, and so on. Anything. Anyone can learn anything. So, my\ninterest is in shaping how a person can interact within that space, with the\npersonalities involved and the way they receive that information. And I think my\nbigger focus would be on understanding concepts rather than the full details,\nand just having a line of communication between the official project and the\ncommunity at large or potential supporters or contributors.\n\nPS: Do you think privacy is important?\n\nDRC: With an emphatic yes, I think that privacy is very important. I possibly\ncouldn’t stress enough how much. People will pay a premium amount of money to\nhave their own space and have thicker walls in an apartment building.

Everyone is anticipating the\nutility features coming out this quarter like the E2EE communication tools and\ndecentralized marketplace.\n\nParticl Desktop is the app all those cool things get rolled into.\n\nParticl Desktop 1.1.0-RC4 (testnet)\nParticl Desktop releases exclusively on Testnet today. This build fixes a lot of\nbugs and also has some new, cool features like ZAP. We need as many testers\nvolunteering to find issues/bugs with this release candidate (RC4) before we\nmake this available on Mainnet in 10 days.\n\nparticl/particl-desktop [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases]\nparticl-desktop - Particl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases]\n\nGlossary\n> Mainnet- Particl’s live blockchain. This is the chain we all use to send PART \nbetween addresses.- Explorer: https://explorer.particl.io/\nTestnet- Particl’s testing environment. This is a separate blockchain from\nMainnet with separate coins from Mainnet.\n- Explorer: https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/\n\nTestnet PART won’t show up on the Mainnet blockchain and vice-versa for Mainnet\nPART and Testnet blockchain.\n\nRelease Notes\nThe team spent time fixing bugs, adding new features and streamlining the flow\nof the GUI. Some pages have been updated to better the user experience.\nFurthermore, a major restructure effort over the GUI codebase has been\ncompleted.\n\nThe code is now more modular, less prone to errors and takes advantage of the\ncapabilities that the latest Angular provides. This pre-marketplace code\nrestructuration will enable us to implement features like auto-update and\nmultiwallet in a much better way.\n\nAs the marketplace will also be integrated soon, we renamed the software to the\nsimple and beautiful “Particl Desktop”. This software is intended to include the\nwallet, the marketplace, secure chat & more. You can now find it under the \nparticl-desktop [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop] repository of the \nParticl GitHub organization [https://github.com/particl].\n\nTest the Particl Desktop to discover all the other improvements we made, and do\nnot hesitate to point out things we might have overlooked in our inevitable\nhumanity (see below to open issues).\n\nZAP\nThe addition of the ZAP functionality will greatly assist in successful cold\nstaking activation*.

[https://github.com/particlcommunity/rfps/blob/master/rfp-0000/rfp-0000.mediawiki]\n\nRFP 1 | Particl Cold Staking Pool\nCreate a cold staking pool for users to delegate their staking power to a pool\noperator in exchange for smaller payouts. Once completed, the code shall be\nopen-sourced for anyone to inspect/audit.\n\nWhat is Cold Staking?\nCold staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely\ndelegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of\nthese “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the\nParticl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to\nspend its coins.\n\nCold staking nodes are intended to be used in combination with cold, hardware\nand paper wallets as well as multisig addresses, making it possible to stake\n“offline” coins with no risk of being hacked or exposing your public key to the\nnetwork. Staking nodes can be set up on any device, secure or not, such as\npublic/cloud servers, virtual machines or RPIs.\n\nScope\nThe recent cold staking hardfork has enabled the possibility to set up cold\nstaking pools where operators cannot run with their users’ coins.

I think my quota was make 1 BTC/day\ntrading — do that and we were good to go! Still in my late-thirties at the time,\ncalling it a retirement sounded great (to me) but I didn’t want the raised\neyebrows all my old college roommates would surely give at our family parties.\n\nSo I improvised.\n\nI mean, who was I to spoil their joy of being neck deep in parenthood? Raising\nchildren, going to ball practices every night, eating McDonald’s in the car\nevery meal. Spending 40+ hours a week away from the ones you loved shouldn’t be\ninterrupted by such nonsense as retiring 15 years after just getting started.\n\nEssentially it was a sabbatical from my “real job” as a healthcare design\narchitect. The career path I unwittingly signed on for as a toddler building\nwith LEGOs, refined in high-school designing cars and lost days of sleep over in\ncollege. “Living the American Dream” of paying into 5–10 years of debt and then\ntrudging through nearly 50 years of service for someone not named “Mr. ME”.\n\nOh glory days!\n\n”I’m in this for the Blockchain”\nI was still playing family man and day trading cryptocurrencies in 2014 when I\ndecided to return to my architecture firm. There really isn’t anything better\nthan having freedom to spend the majority of your day with the people most\nimportant in your life.\n\nMy decision to return to a real job wasn’t as much a necessity as it was a\nstrategic move. Financially we were good, but I had 2 reasons to jump back in.\n\nFirst, frankly, I was bored\n[https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-bore-traders/]. I missed doing design\nand I wasn’t really participating in the communities of any of the coins I was\nholding. When you aren’t involved in a hobby you say you’re passionate about you\nquickly lose interest. Its the Curse of the Entrepreneur\n[http://www.aplacebetween.com/practical/entrepreneurs-curse.html]; lacking focus\nand chasing ideas.\n\nThere weren’t hours of crypto webcasts that popped up daily in my feed to keep\nme entertained, only Bitcointalk.org which was good for a couple train wreck \nsightings [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=857670.0] a week.\n\nLooking back at this time, I can see the tight bond of community, value and\ntechnology. We like to shill our favorite coin’s “first to” and “best at”\ntechnology but most users still don’t understand it all and deep down they only\nwant more people to talk about their project so the price goes up.\n\n> \nSecond, Bitcoin was in a remarkably stable price state and it was telling me it\nis time to accumulate (hence we needed capital), as news was beginning to\nsurround the distributed ledger 1/2 of Satoshi’s invention; the “blockchain”.\n\nI had already begun focusing on privacy coins before returning to the 9–5 with\nnew projects like Darkcoin and Monero beginning development. But I really\ngravitated to projects that were bringing utility into the crypto space. I\ndidn’t sign up to Bitcoin for merely another way to move money on the internet\nfrom one exchange to another, I signed up for a better this ?\n\n> Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial\ninstitutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.\nWhile the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from\nthe inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. — “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer\nElectronic Cash System” — Satoshi Nakamoto\nTo me this speaks to the power of the blockchain. The ability to create\ntrustless models for social platforms, exchanges, marketplaces, storage and even\noracles. These projects were moving past the coin and building in utility, just\nlike the quote above taken from the first line of the Bitcoin Whitepaper \nintroduction [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf].\n\nThis ultimately led me to the Shadow Project which had already developed a\nprivacy currency, ShadowCash SDC, but was now building in some utility with a\ndecentralized marketplace. To me, this was the next step for crypto; creating a \ndecentralized, anonymous economy!\n\nAround this time I finally began volunteering for the first time, wherever I\ncould help within the SDC community. It may have taken me a while to figure this\nout but, I had skills from real life that could actually help a team of\nvolunteers working on an open-source project that I also believed in and\ninvested in.\n\n“Get off your ass and do something!”\nIf you have one of these posters plastered on you’re wall or screen you need\nslapped upside ya head!This ain’t a religion\n[https://hackernoon.com/is-crypto-like-a-religion-6-other-crypto-thoughts-c12a1e7f0453]\n, it’s a revolution! A revolution is led by people not a person.\n\nICOs were around before 2017, but this year we saw ridiculously-funded teams\nbegin to pour into the space. Before 2017 nearly all projects were being\ndeveloped by a handful of volunteer developers, had zero marketing presence and\nwere reliant on community volunteers to create the news. In fact, many of these\nolder projects still rely 100% on volunteers.\n\nI began helping more and more within Shadow and got excited feeling like I was\nmaking a difference rather than piggybacking on everyone else’s hard work. I’d\nlike to think the content I was creating was educating people and helping the\nprice, which also helps with adoption.\n\nAs 2016 was coming to a close, I was in line with everyone else waiting for a\nprivate, anonymous, decentralized marketplace to spend and earn my coins. I had\nmoved most of my holdings into projects trying to make a difference, not just\nforking for a niche currency. And my own project I gave most of my free time to\nwas on the brink of a major pivot.\n\nI was invited to help.\n\n“I’m in this for the Platform”\nThe need for change was harder to see between the green and red candles on\nPoloniex or Bittrex.\n\nAfter all, the Shadow Project team was developing a top 30 cryptocurrency\nproject. They were focused on privacy. They realized merely maintaining a\ncurrency did nobody any good so they were going to build a decentralized\nmarketplace to give people a place to spend and earn their coins. They were\nbuilding a trustless economy powered by the blockchain.\n\nAnd people were starting to notice\n\nChart shows the 7 months leading up to the SDC/PART token exchange. Median\nprice ~$1.50> “You can’t build a great building on a weak foundation. You must\nhave a solid foundation if you’re going to have a strong\nsuperstructure.” — Gordon B. Hinckley\nThere were many factors pointing to an inevitable pivot away from Shadow and\ninto Particl, not the least of which was breaking the implied connection to any\nunderground, shady activity from the name. Darkcoin rebranded to Dash, Dogecoin\nDark rebranded to Verge, BitcoinDark rebranded to Komodo, etc..\n\nA rebrand is an easy transition, sometimes an overnight decision, right Jamie?!\nWhat the Shadow Project team was internally asking all of us to solve was how to\nproperly build this idea of a decentralized economy — privacy, marketplace,\nbuying, selling and earning (currency + utility) — on a secure foundation. To be\nbig and make a difference we would need a codebase that could be developed on,\nadded to and easily enhanced as new technological advances came about.\n\nYou see, SDC was built on Bitcoin 0.8 circa 2013\n[https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history], just like nearly every PoS project\nforked from Bitcoin. And the proper way to build this new trustless economy was\nto build a platform where pieces can be added by other dev teams, governance\nmechanisms can be applied and other cryptocurrencies can be allowed to interact\nwith.\n\nThere was no way in hell all of that was going to be easy to apply to an old\ncodebase. And good luck getting other development teams excited to build\nanything on top of it.\n\nWe decided to abandon the Shadow codebase, blockchain and history in order to\nbuild a more powerful privacy platform, built on the latest Bitcoin codebase;\nthe most hardened, secure and developed codebase in the space.\n\n“Stepping Up My Game”\nBelieve me when I tell you that all of us developing the Particl pivot plans had\nto swallow — force down in some cases — that pill. I’m sure it wasn’t a test\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT4j3xWtaoA] I had just passed, but during\nthese planning meetings I was asked to join the Particl transition team and head\nup Communications for the new project.\n\nAnd can you guess what my first official assignment was in the crypto space? To\nserve up a healthy dose of water for that pill everyone was going to be asked to\nswallow.\n\n> “Don’t limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can\ndo. You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can\nachieve.” — Mary Kay Ash\nThank you, I guess? Turns out it was one of the best decisions of my life!\n\nAnd I think the Particl team has done a damn fine job with our community’s\ngenerosity to build the first decentralized privacy platform that will welcome\ncryptocurrency users from other projects to participate in a cryptoagnostic,\nprivacy marketplace.\n\nParticl: 2017 Year In Review\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797]\nThank you to our developers, community and team!\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797]\n\n“Full-Time Crypto”\nIt’s now 2018 and for the better part of 1 year I’ve definitely NOT been\nsemi-retired.\n\n * I’ve been working 1 full-time job as a real life architect.\n * I’ve been working 1 part-time (30+ hrs/week) job as Head of Communications\n   for Particl.io\n * I still invest in blockchain projects that are creating freedom tools; \n   “convenient and untraceable, liberated from the oversight of governments and\n   banks” — Benjamin Wallace\n * And surprise, surprise, I play the resident “Bitcoin Guru” in my circle of\n   influence — although I’m sure that’s a commonality I share with many of you\n   readers.\n\nWe’ve had an explosive year of growth in Particl and entire cryptocurrency\nspace. Many of you are jumping into early retirement, changing your career path,\nenjoying financial freedom or even cutting ties (as much as possible) with fiat\nmonies forever.\n\nToday I’m proud to say I am also going full-time crypto! And this time I really\nmean it!\nI officially retired from my architecture practice to focus on Particl\nfull-time. I can focus on expanding our team, growing our community and being\nfamily man again. We have lots of growth to prepare for in our community and\namong other cryptocurrency projects as the Particl Marketplace gets released to\nthe public and other currency users have a private, trustless way to buy and\nsell with their own coins, without markups, censorship or unnecessary 3rd party\nfees.\n\nSummary\nI approached this article as an opportunity to share my insights as a\ncryptocurrency trader, bystander, volunteer and team leader. I’ve seen a\nlifetime of lessons and experiences in the short, 6+ years my eyes were opened\nto the realization that, a coin and a blockchain, could change the world.\n\nI love hearing stories of financial freedom, career changes to pursue passions\nand early retirement to spend more time with the people that mean the most.\nCrypto has brought all three to me and I’m excited about the work we’re doing at\nParticl. My day job just got 1000% cooler ?\n\nThis year we will see many trends (platform, atomic swaps, agnosticism, privacy,\ndecentralization) and I think Particl is positioned very well to contribute in\nall these areas for the common good of the entire space.\n\nRemember that there’s no substitute for doing your own research. It’s not all\nabout making money. We’re constantly getting closer to a more private,\ndecentralized future, and away from any and all reliance on fiat.\n\nThat will be the day!","html":"<h3 id=\"and-this-time-i-really-mean-it-\">And this time I really mean it!</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/-Full-Time-Crypto-/0--OIJumdYj3GJ9Sjn.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For nearly all of us in the cryptocurrency space uttering the words “full-time crypto” means something special.
