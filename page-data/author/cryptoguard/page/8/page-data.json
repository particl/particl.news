We have also been preparing for the\ncommencement of the upcoming development cycle and carefully assessing the most\neffective transition strategy to ensure a smooth process.\n\nWe are pleased to report that no significant issue has been found so far.

A wide array of fixes, optimizations, and enhancements have been included,\nand the offer table has been restructured to be more comprehensive and\nuser-friendly. This adds to the current ongoing tasks, which are the following:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\nWe anticipate deploying the changes shortly, allowing all users to update their\nlocal BasicSwap instances and take advantage of the new features.\n\nYear 2022 in Recap ?\n2022 in Review and What’s Coming in 2023Taking a look back at all the progress\nmade in 2022 and a glimpse of the future.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/2022-in-review/]Earlier this week, we proudly published a\ncomprehensive overview of the year 2022 and a glimpse of what's to come in 2023\nand beyond.

the Particl project, we'd like\nto take a moment to look back on 2022 and review all the exciting releases,\nnews, and surprises it brought with it.\n\nBut that's not all! We are pleased to offer a sneak peek into the future and\ngive a glimpse of what to expect marching through what is sure to be an even\nmore exciting year for the project!\n\nLet’s not waste a second more and dive right into it!\n\nTable of Contents\n * Particl Core\n * Particl Desktop\n * BasicSwap DEX\n * Particl Electrum\n * Particl Stories\n * What to Expect in 2023\n * Roadmap\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe year 2022 was a tumultuous one in the world of cryptocurrency, with a number\nof dramatic events occurring within the industry.\n\nFortunately, the Particl project managed to remain largely unaffected by these\ndevelopments, instead making significant progress towards its mission of\nproviding an ecosystem with unrivaled levels of privacy and decentralization.\n\nIndeed, all throughout the year, we have seen considerable development and code\nreleases on the project's Github [https://github.com/particl]. What's more, in\nJune, we unveiled our new vision for the platform's infrastructure, one designed\nto be fully open, modular, and incorporate a multitude of new and cutting-edge\ncapabilities. This strategic refocus is essential in advancing Particl and\nfacilitating its adoption by a broader audience.\n\nBut before we continue to discuss what's in store for the future, let us take a\nstep back and recognize the accomplishments that have been achieved throughout\nthe year.\n\nParticl Core\nGitHub - particl/particl-core: Particl Core integration/staging treeParticl\nCore\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core]Particl Core, the platform’s\nblockchain, is precisely what its name implies; it is the backbone of the PART\ncryptocurrency and powers safe and private currency transactions using the PART\ncoin — complete with a wide range of features like private transactions,\nsmart-contracts, and advanced financial capabilities to be used in intricate\ndecentralized applications.\n\nOne important particularity of the Particl blockchain is that it is forked from\nBitcoin and is actively maintained up-to-date with all its upstream updates —\nproviding you with the assurance that your funds are secure and that the\nplatform has the necessary capabilities to provide all the modern, enhanced\nfunctionality of Bitcoin.\n\nThe significance of this cannot be overstated. By leveraging the Bitcoin\ndeveloper community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire\ntalent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github\nrankings, like CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] for example, where the\nParticl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.\n\nThis is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global\ncollective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday\nlives.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 9, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6]\n * Jan 17, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 1, 2022 — Taproot goes live on mainnet (Particl Core 0.19.2.18\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18]) *\n * Feb 8, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 24, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Apr 13, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.20\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0]\n * Apr 16, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.2.0\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0]\n * Apr 25, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.21\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10]\n * Aug 20, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.22\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0]\n * Oct 2, 2022 — Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1]\n * Nov 12, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0]\n\n* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot\nhardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.\n\nParticl Desktop\nGitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace\nand\nPART coin wallet.

A decentralized peer to peer marketplace –free, secure, private,\nuntraceable. - GitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI applicatio...GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/]This year's recap is also a\ngreat reminder that Particl is far more than a 'privacy coin.' It is, indeed, a\ncomprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and\ndecentralization above all else.\n\nAs such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces,\nthrough which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace.\nWithout it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like\ninterfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.\n\nThat’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides\nusers with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of\napplications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet\nmanagement, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous\norganization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand\nto include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more\nakin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.\n\nThere’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl\necosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times\nthroughout 2022.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 4, 2022 — v3.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]\n * Feb 4, 2022 — v3.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1]\n * Apr 12, 2022 — v3.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2]\n * Apr 14 2022 — v3.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3]\n * May 9, 2022 — v3.2.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0]\n * Jun 29, 2022 — v3.2.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1]\n * Jul 1, 2022 — v3.2.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]\n * Dec 24, 2022 — v3.3.0-RC001\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001] \n    (testnet ongoing) *\n\n* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into the new development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nBasicSwap DEX\nGitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of ConceptBasic Atomic\nSwap Proof of Concept. Contribute to tecnovert/basicswap development by\ncreating\nan account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap]\nPerhaps the most exciting release of the year, BasicSwap is Particl’s brand new\ndApp. Indeed, the simultaneous failure of the FTX scam exchange and the release\nof the BasicSwap DEX proved to be an opportune moment for Particl, as it brought\nconsiderable attention to the platform and its mission.\n\nIt is a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading exchange that offers a secure, private, and\ncompletely decentralized trading platform. It eliminates the need for central\npoints of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap\ncryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking\ndApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a\nmajor milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader\ncryptocurrency industry.\n\nBasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open\nbeta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for a\nvariety of coins [https://basicswapdex.com/markets] (including Monero).\n\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early\nstages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it\ntoday, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few\nminutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you\nhave enabled are synced locally on your device.\n\nBut don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and\nend-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second\nhalf of this blog post.\n\nReleases\n * Nov 30, 2022 — BasicSwap.com Website Release [https://BasicSwapDEX.com/]\n * Dec 7, 2022 — BSX Open Beta\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/]\n\nParticl Electrum\nGitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl WalletElectrum Particl Wallet.\nContribute to particl/electrum development by creating an account on GitHub.\nGitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/electrum]As part of our efforts to\nmake BasicSwap (and other Particl dApps) more easily accessible, we’ve made\nearly strides in providing more light services to the network with the release\nof Particl Electrum, a fork of Bitcoin’s Electrum wallet.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have\npositioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes\nnext with you.\n\nA New Development Cycle Begins\nIt may have been a few months since we’ve announced Particl’s upcoming\ndevelopment cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], but with the\nimminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for\nit to start taking form.\n\nParticl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's\narchitecture, making it modular in design and more open to external\ncontributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:\n\n1- SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized & Private Internet Protocol\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol]\n:\n\nA major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced\nversion of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network\npowering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.\n\nThis update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and\nable to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional\nfunctionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages,\nand other types of data or content.\n\n2- A New Modular Architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension]\n:\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down\nof Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each\nother, but without depending on one another.\n\nThis will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the\noverhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether\nthey are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined\ndevelopment process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved\ninteroperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the\ncontributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or\nservices.\n\n3- Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility]\n:\n\nOne of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the\nease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could\nbe readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving\nthe exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new\naudience.\n\nBut the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate\nthird-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems,\ninto Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.\n\nThis will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with\ndecentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks,\nallowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long\nas they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.\n\nThe changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented\nlevel of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while\nmaintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position\nthe platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the\nbenefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much\nconvenience.\n\n4- Currency and Protocol Agnosticism\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism]\n:\n\nIt is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace\nthe ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain\nitself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms\nmust be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.\n\nAs such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger\ndegree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but\nalso with the protocols that can power its dApps.\n\nCurrently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG\nnetwork, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many\nways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing\nuser base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may\nbe able to provide.\n\nThis is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various\ncryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of\nprivacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as\npossible.\n\nBut don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming\ncycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other\ncryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy\nand flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized\napplications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply\nfunction.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of\napplications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their\ncreators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will\nresult in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real\nvalue to other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nCurrent Roadmap\nTo adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming\ndevelopment cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important\nmilestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the\ndeployment phase.\n\nThe foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open\narchitecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand,\ninvolves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating\nthem into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and\nservices (or variants of current ones) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be\nfully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the\ncommunity. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms,\nwhich is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all\nfronts.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in\n2023 and beyond.\n\nWith the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it\nis clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of\nthe new challenges our world faces.\n\nWe'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for\nyour passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing\nboundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for\nParticl yet!\n\nCheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world\nfor the better lies in our collective hands! ?\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/markets\">a variety of coins</a> (including Monero).</p><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early stages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it today, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few minutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have positioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes next with you.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-development-cycle-begins\">A New Development Cycle Begins</h3><p>It may have been a few months since we’ve announced <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">Particl’s upcoming development cycle</a>, but with the imminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for it to start taking form.</p><p>Particl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's architecture, making it modular in design and more open to external contributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &amp; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

It is, indeed, a comprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and decentralization above all else.</p><p>As such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces, through which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace. Without it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like interfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.</p><p>That’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides users with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of applications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet management, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand to include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more akin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.</p><p>There’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl ecosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times throughout 2022.</p><h3 id=\"releases-1\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">v3.1.0</a></li><li><strong>Feb 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1\">v3.1.1</a></li><li><strong>Apr 12, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2\">v3.1.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 14 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3\">v3.1.3</a></li><li><strong>May 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\">v3.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Jun 29, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1\">v3.2.1</a></li><li><strong>Jul 1, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2\">v3.2.2</a></li><li><strong>Dec 24, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001\">v3.3.0-RC001</a> <em>(testnet ongoing) *</em></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><em>the new development cycle</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id=\"basicswap-dex\">BasicSwap DEX</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept.

It eliminates the need for central points of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap cryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking dApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a major milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>BasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open beta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/markets\">a variety of coins</a> (including Monero).</p><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early stages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it today, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few minutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have positioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes next with you.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-development-cycle-begins\">A New Development Cycle Begins</h3><p>It may have been a few months since we’ve announced <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">Particl’s upcoming development cycle</a>, but with the imminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for it to start taking form.</p><p>Particl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's architecture, making it modular in design and more open to external contributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &#x26; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

This inquiry was prompted by the fact that the desktop version of\nthe marketplace may be perceived as too complex for consumer-level users.\n\n> \"Lite\" client is one of the deliverables intended behind the next development\ncycle. v3.3 was a necessary pre-emptive step though (...) Once the next\ndevelopment phase starts (which will be eased into after v3.3.'s release, while\nstill adding, and fixing, details to v3.3.0), things like lite clients and web\nusable wallets (while still keeping privacy preserved) and all these various UX\nrelated issues, are all intended to be addressed. — Arnold Bansemer\nIndeed, Particl's next development cycle is all about breaking down Particl's\napplications and components into open modules that facilitate greater\ncontributions and more efficient integration into user-friendly platforms. As a\nresult, the development of a web or mobile version of the marketplace, such as\nBasicSwap DEX, is a logical outcome of this major infrastructure upgrade.\n\nTo understand the scope of what this new cycle means for the project, we invite\nyou to read the following blog post carefully as it explains everything in great\ndetail: https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]Given the\nextensive changes introduced with this update, we are calling for your help to\ntest the new version and ensure that no bugs, issues, or unexpected behaviors\nappear as a result.

This bug fixes a faulty behavior in which \"filtering by addresses\" wouldn't\nwork (would return nothing). This functionality is used by BasicSwap to allow\nyou to filter offers by the offerer. \n\nBasicSwap ?\nMore Private Swaps ?\nWe've added a new option that lets you select a more private atomic swap\nprotocol (adaptor signature swaps) for a variety of coins on BasicSwap. This\nadditional swap protocol, which uses scriptless scripts, is the same\nprivacy-first protocol that powers Monero and Particl Anon atomic swaps. It is\nnow also available for all coins that have integrated Segwit into their core.\nHere is the list of coins that fully support this privacy-first swap protocol:\n\n * Bitcoin\n * Litecoin\n * Dash\n * Particl, Particl CT, and Particl Anon\n * Monero (of course)\n\nThis new option is not yet available in the GUI but is ready at the protocol\nlevel. We expect it to be included in the GUI shortly into 2023 when we push its\nnext major update. \n\n> Note: While it is possible to swap Firo and PIVX using this more private\nprotocol, it is mandatory for the \"from\" coin to have Segwit enabled. \n\nIn other words, you cannot list a Firo or PIVX offer requesting another coin\nusing this improved protocol. To list a Firo or PIVX offer, you need to use the\nregular atomic swap protocol (Decred-style). \n\nYou can, however, use the more private swaps using Firo or PIVX by instead\npicking up an offer requesting these coins and swap using the more private\nprotocol if it is the swap type selected by the offerer (i.e., an offer offering\nBitcoin and requesting Firo). \nUser Interface ?️\nOn the side of the user interface of BasicSwap, we're still working on the items\nenumerated in last week's update with good progress being made on all fronts.\nThese items are as follows:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler. \n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This, in part, means traders can\nmake or take orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.\n\nAt this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled\nand ran locally — are available to use. We are however working on deploying more\nconvenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration\ngateways.\n\nFor more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\nCore Values\nBasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for\ncryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the\nbroader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading\nconditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain\nfor monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build\nbridges between various cryptocurrency communities.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values\nthat we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:\n\n 1. Full custody of funds and keys;\n 2. A coin-agnostic architecture;\n 3. No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;\n 4. No accounts, limits, or restrictions;\n 5. Complete and total privacy.\n\nThese are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the\nBasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.\n\nFrom the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy\nBasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself\nin its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a\nprivacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.\n\nIndeed, BasicSwap is born out of a proof of concept\n[https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/] made 2\nyears ago when the Particl team began testing Monero atomic swaps\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap]. This eventually led to the\nrelease of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG\nnetwork, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform\nthat we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.\n\nSuffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and\nis its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the\ndomains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point\ndoes it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum\nlevel of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds.\nCensorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from\nthe application to the protocol level.\n\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an\nimportant part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for\nswapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that\nthe logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist. \n\nThe atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped\nprotocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX\nframework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets. \n\nFor a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized\nchannel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two\nparties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added\nlayer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question\nbecause it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain. \n\nThis is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain\nlevel of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the\nprocess of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in\nthe first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control.\nIn the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to\nthe SMSG network. \n\nMore detailed information on atomic swaps can be found here\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap]. \n\nin-progress waiting done SecureMessaging Network (SMSG) SecureMessaging (SMSG)\nis Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at\nthe core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage Protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts\nas a decentralized storage network (DSN)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG].\nAs such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving\nmanner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a\ncentral server. \n\nThis decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with\nfunctionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and\norder matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties\nswapping from two different chains. \n\nWhen running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node\nalong with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded\ndirectly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless\nscripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX)\nexperience. \n\nMore in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/] \n\nin-progress waiting done Scriptless Scripts Scriptless scripts are another key\naspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of\nBitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in\ntheir basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain\nusing Schnorr Signatures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature] or \nECDSA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm]\n. \n\nIn the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into\nan address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.\nThat way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154]\n. \n\n> \"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of\nan encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the\nprivate encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with\nknowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" Tecnovert — xmrswap\nprotocol notes\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156] \n \n\n\nCompared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide\nadded privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin\nsmart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more\ncomplex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts. \n\nPrivacy: When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the\nentire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants\nand the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless\nscripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage\ndata and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only\nthing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a\nsmart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the\nspecific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be\ncompletely hidden. \n\nScalability: Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving\nthe smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat\nthe blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting\nprocess is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG\nnetwork. \n\nAdditionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage\nSchnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making\nthe actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional\non-chain smart contracts. \n\nin-progress waiting done About the Open Beta Release\nBasicSwap’s open beta is now live, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can\nnow set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero,\nand others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry\nabout the custody of your coins.\n\nConsiderations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage\nThe release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no\nmeans intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for\nit, which you can get a hint at by checking out our roadmap\n[https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nIndeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this\nrelease. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n * It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.\n * It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.\n * It still needs to be manually compiled.\n * It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.\n * It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.\n * It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.\n * It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.\n\nAll of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we\nfully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult\nour\nroadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap], scheduled to release this coming\nMonday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the\nways we intend to improve the platform.\n\nRoadmap and Vision — What’s Next?\nWhile the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey,\nthe best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major,\nunstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the\nentire crypto ecosystem.\n\nGenerally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving\nforward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.\n\n * SMSG 2.0 — For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;\n * Integration frameworks — To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms,\n   web apps, and more;\n * Privacy-centric updates — To improve user privacy and fund security;\n * Lightning Network — For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and\n   capabilities.\n\nThese are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most\nsignificant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on\nthese, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to\nalso be added.\n\nAdditionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for\nit comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a listing application form\n[https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8] on our website that can be filled out to\nrequest new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and\nour current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration\nprocess for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on\nthese matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to\ncontribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those\ngatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and\nwide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!\n\nAs more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will\ncontribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto\nusers. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in\nthe new digital economy.\n\nBig thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring\nyourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the\nplatform and its usage grow over time!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in their basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature\">Schnorr Signatures</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm\">ECDSA</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            In the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into an address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them. That way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154\">One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            <i><blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">\"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of an encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the private encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with knowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">Tecnovert — xmrswap protocol notes</a> </i></blockquote>\n            <br><br>\n            Compared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide added privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin smart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more complex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Privacy:</b> When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the entire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"about-the-open-beta-release\">About the Open Beta Release</h2><p><strong>BasicSwap’s open beta is now live</strong>, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can now set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.</p><h3 id=\"considerations-what-to-expect-at-this-beta-stage\">Considerations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage</h3><p>The release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no means intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\">proof of concept</a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\">Monero atomic swaps</a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.</p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking.

Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in their basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature\">Schnorr Signatures</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm\">ECDSA</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            In the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into an address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them. That way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154\">One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            <i></i></p><blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\"><i>\"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of an encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the private encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with knowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">Tecnovert — xmrswap protocol notes</a> </i></blockquote>\n            <br><br>\n            Compared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide added privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin smart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more complex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Privacy:</b> When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the entire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            <p></p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"about-the-open-beta-release\">About the Open Beta Release</h2><p><strong>BasicSwap’s open beta is now live</strong>, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can now set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.</p><h3 id=\"considerations-what-to-expect-at-this-beta-stage\">Considerations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage</h3><p>The release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no means intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

open beta goes live!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEasy Atomic Swaps Coming to Dash!\nAs soon as BasicSwap's open beta publicly launches — precisely on the 8th of\nDecember, 2022 at 15:00 UTC\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-goes-public-on-december-8/] — you’ll\nbe able to place and take Dash offers on BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]’s\ndistributed order book and swap it in exchange for a range of other\ncryptocurrencies, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Litecoin, Particl, and\nMonero.\n\nAll Dash swaps are powered by atomic swaps and require no third-party\ninvolvement, wrapped assets, or intermediary layers.

time has finally come! After a successful and productive closed beta testing\nround, BasicSwap is now ready to publicly move to its open beta phase!\n\nIndeed, on the 8th of December at 15:00 UTC, the privacy-first and cross-chain\nDEX will go live, allowing everyone to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,\nMonero, Particl and others on an entirely distributed protocol, without third\nparty involvement of any kind.\n\nThis blog post will reveal everything you need to know about the upcoming beta\nlaunch, so make sure that you don’t skip on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * What’s BasicSwap\n * Open Beta Release Information\n * BasicSwap Website and Roadmap\n * What’s Next?\n\nNote: If you’re already familiar with BasicSwap, you may want to immediately\njump to this section containing all the information you need to know ahead of\nthe open beta release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap\n> The Privacy-First and Cross-Chain DEX That Wants to Free Crypto\nAs bold the above statement may sound, this really is what BasicSwap is setting\nout to do.\n\nBasicSwap is a distributed cryptocurrency exchange protocol that lets you trade\ndifferent cryptocurrencies without the use of third-parties or middlemen using\nwhat is known as ‘atomic swaps’.\n\nThe DEX works using an order book system, in contrast to the liquidity pool\n(i.e. AMM) approach\n[https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm] \nthat most other DEXs have opted for. This, in part, means traders can make or\ntake orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.\n\nAt this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled\nand run locally — are available to use. We are however working on deploying more\nconvenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration\ngateways.\n\nFor more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\nCore Values\nBasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for\ncryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the\nbroader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions\nfor all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for\nmonetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges\nbetween various cryptocurrency communities.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values\nthat are bound to be in the interest of all traders:\n\n 1. Full custody of funds and keys;\n 2. A coin-agnostic architecture;\n 3. No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;\n 4. No accounts, limits, or restrictions;\n 5. Complete and total privacy.\n\nThese are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the\nBasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.\n\nFrom the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy\nBasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself\nin its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a\nprivacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.\n\nIndeed, BasicSwap is born out of a proof of concept\n[https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/] made 2\nyears ago when the Particl team began testing Monero atomic swaps\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap]. This eventually led to the\nrelease of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG\nnetwork, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform\nthat we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.\n\nSuffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and\nis its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with\nthe planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot,\nSMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. \n\nUnder the Hood\nBasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the\ndomains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point\ndoes it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum\nlevel of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds.\nCensorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from\nthe application to the protocol level.\n\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an\nimportant part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for\nswapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that\nthe logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist. \n\nThe atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped\nprotocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX\nframework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets. \n\nFor a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized\nchannel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two\nparties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added\nlayer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question\nbecause it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain. \n\nThis is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain\nlevel of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the\nprocess of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in\nthe first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control.\nIn the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to\nthe SMSG network. \n\nMore detailed information on atomic swaps can be found here\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap]. \n\nin-progress waiting done SecureMessaging Network (SMSG) SecureMessaging (SMSG)\nis Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at\nthe core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage Protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts\nas a decentralized storage network (DSN)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG].\nAs such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving\nmanner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a\ncentral server. \n\nThis decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with\nfunctionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and\norder matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties\nswapping from two different chains. \n\nWhen running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node\nalong with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded\ndirectly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless\nscripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX)\nexperience. \n\nMore in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/] \n\nin-progress waiting done Scriptless Scripts Scriptless scripts are another key\naspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of\nBitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in\ntheir basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain\nusing Schnorr Signatures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature] or \nECDSA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm]\n. \n\nIn the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into\nan address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.\nThat way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154]\n. \n\n> \"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of\nan encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the\nprivate encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with\nknowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" Tecnovert — xmrswap\nprotocol notes\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156] \n \n\n\nCompared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide\nadded privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin\nsmart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more\ncomplex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts. \n\nPrivacy: When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the\nentire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants\nand the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless\nscripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage\ndata and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only\nthing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a\nsmart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the\nspecific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be\ncompletely hidden. \n\nScalability: Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving\nthe smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat\nthe blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting\nprocess is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG\nnetwork. \n\nAdditionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage\nSchnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making\nthe actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional\non-chain smart contracts. \n\nin-progress waiting done Open Beta Release Information\nOn 08/12/2022 at 15:00 UTC, BasicSwap’s open beta goes live, on mainnet, for\neveryone. That means you’ll be able to set up the DEX and start trading with\ncryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without\nrestrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.\n\nConsiderations — What to Expect on Launch Day\nThe release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no\nmeans intended as the final version of BasicSwap.\n\nIndeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this\nrelease. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n * It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.\n * It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.\n * It still needs to be manually compiled.\n * It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.\n * It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.\n * It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.\n * It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.\n\nAll of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we\nfully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult our\nroadmap, scheduled to release this coming Wednesday, to get a better\nunderstanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve\nthe platform.\n\nClosed Beta Status\nThe “closed beta” phase refers to a round of testing we’ve run with a select\ngroup of testers from the community. This phase concludes on 08/12/2022 at 15:00\nwith the launch of the open beta.\n\nHowever, we are happy to report that we now have a feature freeze on BasicSwap\nas of several days ago\n[https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1593691361731018754?s=20&t=MghrOuho2YRbk8HKAneQFQ]\n, meaning there won’t be new additions or updates until the open beta release.\nThis is to ensure a stable launch free of any last minute issues.\n\n> Today, we're putting the #BasicSwap\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/BasicSwap?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] #DEX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] under \"feature\nfreeze\" until its open beta launch!\n\nFocus is now exclusively on the big release ?\n\nCOMING NEXT: Release date announcement! ?#DEXRevolution\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEXRevolution?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] #FTX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] #NoMoreCEX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMoreCEX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\n\n— BasicSwap DEX (@BasicSwapDEX) November 18, 2022\n[https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1593691361731018754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nWebsite and Roadmap Go Live on Wednesday!\nBasicSwapDEXMeet BasicSwap, the privacy-first and cross-chain DEX. Swap coins\nlike Bitcoin and Monero on a trading platform that’s free, unstoppable, and\nconfidential. By the Particl Project.BasicSwapDEX [https://basicswapdex.com/]\nWe’re also excited to announce the upcoming release of BasicSwap’s own website — \nBasicSwapDEX.com [https://basicswapdex.com/] — this coming Wednesday the 30th of\nNovember, 2022. It intends on communicating in a clear and concise manner what\nBasicSwap is, what benefits one can expect from it, and how to use it.\n\nEqually as important, it is also meant to be centric in Particl’s current and\nfuture BasicSwap-related marketing efforts — serving as both a landing page and\neducational portal for any newfound curious minds.\n\nIf you want to tell others about BasicSwap, then the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html] \nand BasicSwapDEX.com [http://basicswapdex.com] are the best ways to go about it!\n\nRoadmap to be Published\nBundled with the release of the website will be the publication of a\nBasicSwap-specific product roadmap. Due to the ever-evolving blockchain\nlandscape acting as a moving target, the roadmap will be presented as a set of\nnon-linear achievements for maximum flexibility and adaptability.\n\nWhat’s Next for BasicSwap?\nWhile the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey,\nthe best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major,\nunstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the\nentire crypto ecosystem.\n\nGenerally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving\nforward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.\n\n * SMSG 2.0 — For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;\n * Integration frameworks — To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms,\n   web apps, and more;\n * Privacy-centric updates — To improve user privacy and fund security;\n * Lightning Network — For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and\n   capabilities.\n\nThese are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most\nsignificant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on\nthese, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to\nalso be added.\n\nAdditionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for\nit comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a listing application form\n[https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8] on our website that can be filled out to\nrequest new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and\nour current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration\nprocess for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on\nthese matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo there it is, the official open beta release date is now announced and mere\ndays stand before its launch! If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution\nand help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as “centralized\nexchanges”, then help us spread the word far and wide!\n\nAs more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, contributing to\nbringing better, more free trading conditions for all!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This, in part, means traders can make or take orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.</p><p><strong>At this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled and run locally — are available to use.</strong> We are however working on deploying more convenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration gateways.</p><p>For more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"core-values\">Core Values</h3><p>BasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for cryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\"><strong>proof of concept</strong></a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\"><strong>Monero atomic swaps</strong></a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with the planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot, SMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. </p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for swapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that the logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist.\n            <br><br> \n            The atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped protocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX framework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets.\n            <br><br>\n            For a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized channel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two parties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added layer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question because it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain.\n            <br><br>\n            This is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain level of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the process of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in the first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control. In the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            More detailed information on atomic swaps can be found \n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap\">here</a>.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            SecureMessaging (SMSG) is Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at the core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\">BitMessage Protocol</a>, the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG\">decentralized storage network (DSN)</a>. As such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a central server.\n            <br><br>\n            This decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with functionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and order matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties swapping from two different chains.\n            <br><br>\n            When running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node along with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded directly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless scripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX) experience.\n            <br><br>\n            More in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Scriptless Scripts</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Scriptless scripts are another key aspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of Bitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in their basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature\">Schnorr Signatures</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm\">ECDSA</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            In the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into an address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them. That way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154\">One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            <i><blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">\"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of an encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the private encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with knowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">Tecnovert — xmrswap protocol notes</a> </i></blockquote>\n            <br><br>\n            Compared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide added privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin smart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more complex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Privacy:</b> When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the entire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"open-beta-release-information\">Open Beta Release Information</h2><p>On <strong>08/12/2022 at 15:00 UTC</strong>, BasicSwap’s open beta goes live, on mainnet, for everyone.

They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\"><strong>listing application form</strong></a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings.

This, in part, means traders can make or take orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.</p><p><strong>At this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled and run locally — are available to use.</strong> We are however working on deploying more convenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration gateways.</p><p>For more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"core-values\">Core Values</h3><p>BasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for cryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\"><strong>proof of concept</strong></a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\"><strong>Monero atomic swaps</strong></a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with the planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot, SMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. </p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for swapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that the logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist.\n            <br><br> \n            The atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped protocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX framework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets.\n            <br><br>\n            For a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized channel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two parties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added layer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question because it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain.\n            <br><br>\n            This is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain level of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the process of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in the first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control. In the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            More detailed information on atomic swaps can be found \n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap\">here</a>.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            SecureMessaging (SMSG) is Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at the core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\">BitMessage Protocol</a>, the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG\">decentralized storage network (DSN)</a>. As such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a central server.\n            <br><br>\n            This decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with functionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and order matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties swapping from two different chains.\n            <br><br>\n            When running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node along with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded directly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless scripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX) experience.\n            <br><br>\n            More in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Scriptless Scripts</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Scriptless scripts are another key aspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of Bitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in their basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature\">Schnorr Signatures</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm\">ECDSA</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            In the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into an address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them. That way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154\">One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            <i></i></p><blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\"><i>\"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of an encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the private encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with knowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">Tecnovert — xmrswap protocol notes</a> </i></blockquote>\n            <br><br>\n            Compared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide added privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin smart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more complex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Privacy:</b> When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the entire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            <p></p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"open-beta-release-information\">Open Beta Release Information</h2><p>On <strong>08/12/2022 at 15:00 UTC</strong>, BasicSwap’s open beta goes live, on mainnet, for everyone.

They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\"><strong>listing application form</strong></a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So there it is, the official open beta release date is now announced and mere days stand before its launch!

excited to announce that we’ve successfully completed BasicSwap’s user\ninterface (GUI v0.1), meaning that the final closed beta testing round has now\nbegun! ?\n\nThis is an important milestones and the last step before the public release of\nthe open beta, so make sure to read this blog post in full to get all the\ndetails and get a better idea of what to expect in the next few days to come!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is BasicSwap?\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]BasicSwap is\na cross-chain and private decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol and a trading\napp that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another without any middleman\nor third-party being involved.\n\nIt lets you make or take orders on a distributed order book and execute swaps\nthat are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and private. All of this combined sets\nBasicSwap apart as a DEX with uncompromising ease of use, security and\ndecentralization, and creates an environment that is totally free of any central\npoint of failure. Best of all: there are absolutely no trading fees!\n\nWe’ve already published an extensive blog post explaining everything you need\nto\nknow about BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]. So if you\nwant more information on this upcoming breakthrough DEX, make sure to give it a\nread!\n\nAbout BasicSwap’s User Interface\nAs you may already be aware, the BasicSwap back-end protocol (\"swap engine\") has\nbeen operational as an early beta software for a while, allowing mainnet swaps\nto take place between a range of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nParticl and even Monero.\n\nHowever, what it lacked, up until today, was a user-friendly and easy-to-use\ninterface to facilitate the act of trading on the platform. As we’ve often seen\nwithin the blockchain industry, the user experience is of the utmost importance.\n\nThat’s why we’ve opted to wait until BasicSwap’s user-friendly GUI was ready\nbefore publicly releasing the beta. And now that this is done, we enter a new\nphase for BasicSwap!\n\nThe Final Closed Beta Testing Round Begins Today\nWith the first version of the BasicSwap GUI now completed (v0.1), we have now\nbegun the final closed beta testing round before the public launch of the open\nbeta.\n\nDuring this final round, we’ll thoroughly test the user interface across a wide\nrange of environments and scenarios as well as the DEX protocol itself. This\nwill ensure the smoothest and most hassle-free open beta launch (public)\npossible.\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap’s Status?\nBasicSwap is a beta product and still under development. The release of the open\nbeta is a major milestone in its development but it is by no means a completed\nproduct.\n\nAs such, there may be missing features, quirks in the user experience, and areas\nof improvement. This is normal at this stage, and that’s precisely where we need\nyou!\n\nIf, during the upcoming open beta, you encounter any issue, bug, or discover\nareas of improvements, be sure to let us know by logging it on the DEX’s issue\npage [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/issues]. This also applies to\ngeneral comment, feedback, and suggestions; they are the entire reason for an\nopen beta!\n\nIssues · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/issues]We are working hard on building\nthe most resilient, private, and decentralized DEX platform for all and your\nhelp and contributions are vital in making this happen!\n\nWhen is BasicSwap Expected to Launch Publicly?\nIt isn’t possible to confirm the precise public launch date yet. That’s because\nit is highly dependent on how the final closed beta testing round goes.\n\nHowever, we don’t expect that testing period to last for a long time. We’ll be\nsure to communicate clearly the launch date a few days before.\n\nHow Can I Support the Upcoming Open Beta Launch?\nAs the open beta launch approaches rapidly, there are a few things you can\nalready do to pre-emptively help out.\n\nFirst and foremost, BasicSwap uses an order book system to match traders\ntogether rather than a single liquidity pool. That means its user experience\ndepends in major part on the liquidity available on the books.\n\nAs such, putting liquidity on BasicSwap when it releases not only grants you\naccess to a healthier trading environment on which you can trade, but it also\nhelps others match their trades, making BasicSwap a more viable solution for all\nand, in turn, bringing more liquidity as a result.\n\nSimilarly to putting liquidity on the books, every attempt at getting the word\nout also helps immensely. Whether that be to friends, in your online\ncommunities, on Reddit or crypto Twitter, any place is a good place to let\nothers, who may benefit from what BasicSwap has to offer, know about it.\n\nA DEX thrives the bigger its user base is; we all win by bringing more people to\nBasicSwap and providing liquidity!\n\nBasicSwap Website About to Go Live\nTo support the public launch of BasicSwap’s beta and help others better\nunderstand how the platform benefits them, we will launch a new website entirely\ndedicated to BasicSwap. This will be an incredibly useful tool that will make it\neasier to share with others what vital benefits they can get for using a\nproperly decentralized and privacy-focused trading platform.\n\nThe launch of the BasicSwap website is planned for before the launch of the open\nbeta.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA better, more private, and fair-to-all trading environment looms and there’s no\nturning back!\n\nAs always, we will keep you posted about it through our weekly development\nprogress reports available on Particl News. See you soon during the open beta!\n?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The failed block index is then added to m_failed_blocks — a record of\nfailed blocks maintained by the node — and remains in there even after the block\nindex is removed from the blockchain to prevent DoS issues.\n\nWhen the next valid block is staked, it is assigned the same block index as the\nremoved block index still in m_failed_blocks because the blockchain only\nverifies m_failed_blocks when blocks arrive out of order, not knowing this\nspecific block index is already in use.\n\nThus, after the node processes a group of blocks following an invalid block, it\ndetects a false positive in m_failed_blocks and refuses to follow the valid\nchain, instead spawning a new fork. As m_failed_blocks only exists in memory\nwhen the node restarts, the chain can sync past that fork.\n\nThis update fixes that issue by properly removing the block index from the \nm_failed_blocks.\n\nHow to Check if my Node was Impacted?\nThe best way to check if your node was impacted is to verify at what block it is\ncurrently staking. If your staking node's current block number matches that of \nParticl's explorer [https://explorer.particl.io], then your node hasn't been\nimpacted.\n\nIf it shows a different block number, then it is likely stuck to an odd fork and\nisn't staking on the right chain anymore. \n\nHow to Fix my Impacted Node(s)?\n * For individual stakers: Simply update your Particl Core version, restart your\n   node, and run the clearbanned command. \n * For staking pools: Update your Particl Core version, run a fresh syncing\n   process in observer mode, then switch to the master branch. \n\n> Note: In some rare cases, you may need to restart your node more than once until\nit syncs back to the correct chain. Running clearbanned should, however, cleanly\nget you back in sync without having to restart your node multiple times.\nWhat's the Impact of this Bug?\nThe impact of this bug would usually be relatively small, preventing affected\nstakers from receiving staking rewards until they get their nodes back in sync.\nUnfortunately, this time the issue happened during an on-chain voting period. \n\nAs a result, we expect this voting round's participation rate to be\nsignificantly lower than what we typically see in other votes because a number\nof large nodes and one staking pool were knocked off the network momentarily.\n\nStill, the current vote is already well over the required participation rate\nthreshold, meaning that its outcome won't be negatively impacted by this bug.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always and especially this time, we strongly recommend updating your Particl\nCore node(s) as soon as possible. Although this issue may be very rare, it does\nimpact the stability of the network and gets more problematic when on-chain\nvoting rounds are ongoing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

description of what this update fixes, refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commit/5ed042e67ba09f808ad5328fc21f504cc44f3c27\">this link</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened\">What Happened?</h2><p>A rare bug occurred around mid-week last week in which some staking nodes, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/particl_page/status/1561454904425623552?s=21&#x26;t=MKjkbzbCEsrkWC3w8O-TZQ\">one staking pool</a>, were knocked off the network and thrown into a fork.</p><p>Typically, Particl Core functions so that a block index is added for an invalid block to prevent nodes from trying to redownload the same block from other peers. The failed block index is then added to <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> — a record of failed blocks maintained by the node — and remains in there even after the block index is removed from the blockchain to prevent DoS issues.</p><p>When the next valid block is staked, it is assigned the same block index as the removed block index still in <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> because the blockchain only verifies <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> when blocks arrive out of order, not knowing this specific block index is already in use.</p><p>Thus, after the node processes a group of blocks following an invalid block, it detects a false positive in <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> and refuses to follow the valid chain, instead spawning a new fork. As <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> only exists in memory when the node restarts, the chain can sync past that fork.</p><p><strong>This update fixes that issue by properly removing the block index from the <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code>.</strong></p><h2 id=\"how-to-check-if-my-node-was-impacted\">How to Check if my Node was Impacted?</h2><p>The best way to check if your node was impacted is to verify at what block it is currently staking. If your staking node's current block number matches that of <a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io\">Particl's explorer</a>, then your node hasn't been impacted.</p><p>If it shows a different block number, then it is likely stuck to an odd fork and isn't staking on the right chain anymore. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-fix-my-impacted-node-s-\">How to Fix my Impacted Node(s)?</h2><ul><li><strong>For individual stakers:</strong> Simply update your Particl Core version, restart your node, and run the <code class=\"language-text\">clearbanned</code> command. </li><li><strong>For staking pools: </strong>Update your Particl Core version, run a fresh syncing process in observer mode, then switch to the master branch. </li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In some rare cases, you may need to restart your node more than once until it syncs back to the correct chain. Running <code class=\"language-text\">clearbanned</code> should, however, cleanly get you back in sync without having to restart your node multiple times.</blockquote><h2 id=\"what-s-the-impact-of-this-bug\">What's the Impact of this Bug?</h2><p>The impact of this bug would usually be relatively small, preventing affected stakers from receiving staking rewards until they get their nodes back in sync. Unfortunately, this time the issue happened during an on-chain voting period. </p><p>As a result, we expect this voting round's participation rate to be significantly lower than what we typically see in other votes because a number of large nodes and one staking pool were knocked off the network momentarily.</p><p>Still, the current vote is already well over the required participation rate threshold, meaning that its outcome won't be negatively impacted by this bug.</p><hr><p>As always and especially this time, we strongly recommend updating your Particl Core node(s) as soon as possible. Although this issue may be very rare, it does impact the stability of the network and gets more problematic when on-chain voting rounds are ongoing.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Since then, we’ve mainly\nworked on improving Particl Marketplace and Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] and getting BasicSwap\nready for its open beta launch\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]Here’s a\nbrief list of releases we’ve delivered since the start of the second funding\ncycle.\n\n * BasicSwap open beta launch (imminent\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/])\n * Successful Taproot hardfork (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/taproot-hardfork-successful/])\n * Particl Electrum release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-electrum-now-available/])\n * Six (6) Particl Desktop releases (check it out\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases])\n * Seven (7) Particl Core releases (check it out\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Core 23.x latest version (check it out\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Marketplace messaging system (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-live-on-mainnet/])\n\nRoadmap Progress\nWe’ve also made steady progress on the completion of various development\nroadmap\nitems [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/]. Here are the ones we’ve\ncompleted or made significant progress with during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We're now very close to releasing the long-anticipated open beta\nof BasicSwap, along with a user-friendly user interface. We've also massively\nimproved the DEX codebase, making it easier to use and faster to get started\nwith. \n\nAt the time of this writing, we are running a final round of tests on the\ncurrently available features and functions, as well as on the app's GUI. Once\nthat is completed and all potential issues are resolved, we will begin a final\nround of tests within our closed beta group, after which we will launch the open\nbeta. \n\nWeb framework We've made progress on the incremental deployment of an early web\nframework, notably by releasing the Particl.Store [https://www.particl.store] \ndemo. \n\nAlthough this may seem like a small step, this gateway uses a different and\nimproved marketplace codebase than Particl Desktop. It improves the coding\nefficiency and allows for greater compatibility with external access gateways —\na critical capability moving forward with Particl's next evolutionary phase. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nConstant blockchain updates and improved zap functionality As usual, we've made\ncountless improvements to Particl Core, always keeping it up-to-date with the\nrecent versions of Bitcoin. As you can see here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master], this is no small task. \n\nNotably, we've improved its staking zap functionality by allowing for a more\ncustomizable process management. You can now choose between two zapping options;\noptimized for staking revenue or optimized for maximum privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Back in March, we've released the Particl Electrum light wallet\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-now-available/]. It provides light\nblockchain services to the ecosystem on both desktop and mobile devices. \n\nParticl Electrum is expected to play a useful role in usability with the\necosystem's upcoming evolutionary phase, allowing dApps and services to connect\nto and use Particl Blockchain without having to sync it fully. \n\nTaproot Support On February 1st, the Particl Blockchain successfully hardforked to enable the\nTaproot protocol improvement [https://particl.news/taproot-hardfork-successful/]\n. Taproot is a major upgrade for Particl Blockchain, allowing for more complex\nsmart-contracts, cheaper transactions, and better privacy and scalability. \n\nMarketplace\nMessaging system During this funding cycle, the most significant feature update\nto Particl Marketplace has been the addition of a decentralized messaging system\nin which sellers, buyers, and potential buyers can discuss. \n\nThis is a critical functionality, especially when issues require to be resolved\nbefore both parties agree to finalize an escrowed marketplace transaction. \n\nProduct codes Product codes attach a unique ID to listing templates, allowing\nfor better inventory management and more efficient use of external platforms. \n\nThis feature update already embraces Particl's new modular approach by allowing\nindividual marketplace listings to interact with outside \"modules\" (i.e.,\nthird-party cross-platform inventory management system). \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two feature updates mentioned\nabove, a large number of general additions, improvements, and bug fixes have\nbeen added to Particl Marketplace and the desktop application. Because there is\nway too much to mention here, we invite you to check out the full list of\nchanges available here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements As part of the upcoming Particl Desktop\n3.3 release, we've begun incrementally separating Particl Core from Particl\nDesktop. \n\nAlthough it used to be a singular roadmap item at the time of the previous\nfunding cycle, this process has now become part of a wider ecosystem upgrade\nwhich we announced earlier this week here\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]. \n\nMore user configurability We've been working, also as part of the upcoming\nParticl Desktop 3.3 release, on better client user configuration. This will give\nusers more options and control over their Particl experience. This improvement\nis partly related to the previous item regarding Core and Desktop separation and\nis a step forward in the context of Particl's upcoming new development cycle. \n\nMajor dependencies update and general improvements Throughout the second funding\ncycle, we've made a major dependencies update and applied a large number of code\nimprovements, bug fixes, and tweaks to the desktop client. You can see every\naddition to Particl Desktop by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/]. \n\nThe Announcement of Particl's Next Evolutionary Leap Forward\nOn the 2nd of August, 2022, we published the major announcement of Particl's\nnext evolutionary phase.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]The announced\ndevelopment cycle will be the biggest evolution of the Particl ecosystem since\nthe project's inception in 2017.

And\nalthough it’s been mentioned a few times before in the weekly progress reports\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/] or in community chatter, it hasn’t yet been\nofficially announced in detail.\n\nToday changes that.\n\nSummary\nIn this comprehensive blog post, we will reveal all the details of Particl’s\nupcoming major development cycle, what makes it such a big deal, and discover\nhow it’s going to propel the project into its next major evolutionary phase.\n\nIndeed, what’s coming up is the biggest improvement to the Particl ecosystem\nsince the inception of the project in 2017 and the most ambitious undertaking\nthe team has ever planned. It will improve the ecosystem from all angles, making\nit more accessible, user-friendly, and flexible than ever.\n\nThis will result in a suite of easy-to-use and very accessible privacy-first\napplications that anybody can use — bringing uncompromising privacy, liberty,\nand independence into the lives of as many people as ever.\n\nIn many ways, calling this new cycle a major leap forward for Particl would be\nan understatement. The benefits will extend far beyond the Particl community!\n\nTable of Contents\n * The State of our Digital World\n * Announcing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle\n * Particl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World\n * —— 1.

With the web now having\nsuch a prevalent place in our society, this crisis ends up bleeding into every\nsingle aspect of our lives — it affects not only our finances but also our\nprivate communications, our personal and professional lives, and our ability to\ndo almost anything online.\n\nGone are the days of what once was a free and open web. Instead, as we’ve\nrecently explored in various Particl Stories [https://particl.news/tag/stories/]\n, there is a worryingly increasing trend in the rate of censorship, \ngeo-political meddling\n[https://particl.news/unhosted-wallets-and-the-fight-against-out-of-touch-policies/]\n, big tech abuses\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/], \nreckless data mining\n[https://particl.news/the-need-for-an-open-source-revolution/], and various\nagenda-driven actions by the Internet’s largest platform operators.\n\nUndoubtedly, we, as individuals, need to stand up to this takeover and take back\ncontrol of our web. We need to reassert and safeguard our rights to an open,\nfree, and private web environment, as it was originally intended to be, and be\nthe change we want to see in this world!\n\nWhereas certain governments, corporations, or other types of organizations\ncontinue to elevate their level of control and power using the current web\ninfrastructure, there is a growing need to stop fighting on their own turf and,\ninstead, pioneer the digital world of tomorrow in which the rights and freedoms\nof each individual are guaranteed.\n\nWhen accessible and easy to use, disruptive technology — as is the case with\nParticl’s privacy-first dApps — becomes both a shield and a weapon, protecting\nus from digital abuse but also striking back by allowing people to thrive\nwithout interference from the current centralized web infrastructure.\n\nThe Shortcomings of Web3\nThat is, in essence, what Web3 promised to accomplish: a more open, independent,\nand free internet for all. Unfortunately, as we’ve come to discover\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], what Web3 promises and\nwhat it currently delivers diverges on many fronts. If you dive into its present\nstate, you can see that it’s much more centralized than it first appears —\nrelying, in major parts, on traditional “big tech” infrastructure — and that it\nturns out to be a near disaster in terms of privacy and decentralization.\n\nWeb3 Exposed! Is it Only a Mirage?A cold hard and in-depth look into the\npromises and current realities of “Web3”.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]Web3, and by association\nDeFi as well, offers a level of financial privacy that is ultimately lower than\neven the traditional banking system. On the latter, only a few parties can\naccess your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the\npayment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners.\nWith Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and\npublicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply\nlook for the entirety of your information in public records.\n\nCase in point, here are the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user\n[https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth]\n, their detailed financial history\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0], as\nwell as all the NFTs they own\n[https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth]\n. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at\nthe time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is\npermanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is\nable to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and\nfuture financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the\n“economy or internet of tomorrow”.\n\nWhat’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such\nas we’ve seen with Infura, MetaMask\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8]\n, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized \nNFT marketplace OpenSea\n[https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/]\n.\n\nWith so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3\nsucceed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not\nliving up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online\nprivacy and security compared to even Web2.\n\nIn reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but\nrather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its\nmission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the\nsheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most\ncritical foundations of Web3.\n\nIndeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web\ncan be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional\nweb infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it\nunfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.\n\nParticl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right\ndirection.\n\nBuilding the Right Foundation\nParticl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by\ngranting it a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first\ndecentralized applications can be deployed.\n\nBy leveraging the firepower of an ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf] \nand giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and\nopen-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to\nfight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create\na parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center —\nsimultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them\nfrom the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and\nall the consequences it brings forth.\n\nAnnouncing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle\nIn a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the\necosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure,\nultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use\nprivacy-first dApps.\n\nBefore we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important\nto understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of\nParticl’s strengths and what makes it unique.\n\nWhat Makes Particl Unique?\nParticl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a\nunique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the\nSecureMessaging network (SMSG).\n\nParticl Blockchain \nThe Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both\nvarious privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot,\netc) as well as a high level of flexibility.\n\nWhile its native cryptocurrency, PART, allows for untraceable payments to be\nmade (privacy coin)\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/], the\nblockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and\nprivacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless\nscripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique\nconvergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the\nParticl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry\nwith an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl \nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] or BasicSwap DEX\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\n> Note: Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people\nwithin the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend\nto be less widely known. You can learn more about them here\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#scriptless-scripts] \nor by reading this in-depth guide\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts].\nSecureMessaging Network (SMSG)\nSecureMessaging (SMSG) is a P2P mixnet that allows peers to communicate\nencrypted data with other peers or applications without the need for third\nparties or middlemen. Inspired by the BitMessage protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], it stores and transfers data across\nnodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).\n\nIn other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and\nusers themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much\nmore complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart\ncontracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nParticl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World\nParticl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a\ndecentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps\nthat protect the rights and liberties of its users.\n\nCompared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms\nof the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for\nthe good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and\nsociety as a whole.\n\nThe strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:\n\n 1. Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities\n    (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")\n 2. Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure\n 3. Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to\n    host decentralized applications and interact with them\n 4. Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy\n\nLet's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more\ndetail.\n\n1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol\nA big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the data\ntransmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], which\nruns in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes\npossible more advanced features and functionality than traditional\nsmart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and\nBasicSwap DEX dApps.\n\nThe SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True PrivacyLearn more about what makes\nParticl decentralized applications truly special and private!Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/]But\nwhile the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way\nto communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive\nlevels of simultaneous usage.\n\nAdditionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making\nit more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet\ninfrastructure.\n\nAnd so, the first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to\nmake it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality —\nessentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.\n\nAn Open and Decentralized Web Architecture\nTo get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It\nis true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities\nwe need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how\nmuch usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code\nimplementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the\nway it is built.\n\nThat’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the\nmission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.\n\nDistributed Web Content and dApp Hosting\nA critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data\nbut also host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps —\nentirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide\nweb”).\n\nTo put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming\nSMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and\nprivacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.\n\nWith dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed\nnetwork, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of\nour current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over\nthe past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely\ncensorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from\nany interference from central parties.\n\nNear-Infinite Scalability\nTo be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of\ntomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially\nincreasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl\ndApps).\n\nThis feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes.\nWhereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes\n— with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the\nmessages’ content — SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured\nfashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic.\n\nThis effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And\nas more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a\nsufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in\nadoption requires.\n\n2. A New Modular Architecture\nThe second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new\nmodular dimension. Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a\nsignificant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of\npioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services —\nwe’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient,\nand that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.\n\nParticl’s Current Infrastructure\nUnfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not\nas open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost\nexclusively on the Particl team.\n\nEven in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by\nbuilding a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full\ncooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s\nmain access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need\nto keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.\n\nIn reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t\nas much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl\nMarketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of\nParticl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.\n\nCooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration\nOne of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic.\nEven though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent\nfrom Particl Desktop, it is not.\n\nIndeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl\nDesktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In\nthat sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than\na standalone dApp.\n\nParticl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much\ngreater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access\ngateways (Particl Desktop).\n\nEnabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps\nNot only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the\nParticl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps\ninto their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key\nfunctionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.\n\nLet’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded\ndeveloper wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the\nmessaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would\ninstantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of\nSMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to\ncommunicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.\n\nBecause even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be\nhard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of\ndesired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires\nto be re-implemented all over again.\n\nAgain, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one\ndApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new,\nparallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.\n\nIntroducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK\nTo remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from\nnow on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its\necosystem into a set of developer-friendly modules that can be added, removed,\nconfigured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX)\nor an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.\n\nModules\nIn this context, a module refers to a readily-available packaged set of code,\nlibraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an\nexternal environment (i.e., a dApp). They grant dApps critical and/or common\nParticl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp\nunique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex\nfunctions.\n\nDeveloper SDK\nParticl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a \nstandardized set of development tools and documentation. Not only does the SDK\nimprove dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely\nimplemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to\nbuild privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that\ndevelopers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a\nstructured and standardized way.\n\nAccess gateways\nThis term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is\naccessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or\nSMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.\n\nThe Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison\nA good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing\nParticl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile\napplications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not\nneed direct access to the underlying hardware features.\n\nInstead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests\npermission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to\nthird-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to\nre-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely\nrequests this functionality from the OS.\nThis, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them\nprovides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.\n\nNot only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside\ncontributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient\nagainst outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the\nway dApps are developed and maintained.\n\nDeploying Particl’s Key Modules\nAmong the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into\nmodules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark\non this new development phase.\n\n * Blockchain node modules (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)\n * Payment module (to provide payment solutions)\n * Market-related modules (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)\n * Two-party escrow system (to provide trade assurance)\n * SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat (for safe communications)\n * SMSG — Decentralized storage (to store data online)\n * SMSG — Decentralized hosting (to host web content and dApps)\n * SMSG — Controller module (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG\n   messages (back-end services for developers))\n * Swap modules (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)\n * Staking module (to integrate PART staking capabilities)\n * Third-party integrations (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP,\n   i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)\n\nNote that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be\nisolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical\nones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.\n\nHow Does This Benefit Particl?\nThe ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the\nsuccess of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.\n\nMakes development easier and increases production pace\nWith a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to\ndevelop an application when not having to deal with various setup and\nmaintenance burdens.\n\nCurrently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the\nclient, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client\nfits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other\nbuilt-in apps.\n\nFor example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the\nmarketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply\nbecause it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how\nParticl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the\nmessaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work\nrequired and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development\nburden to maintain.\n\nThis type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into\nan independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply\nrequest an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead\nof creating it from scratch.\n\nThis will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate\ncommunity contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to\nbuild dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.\n\nMake dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re\nhosted on\nAdding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps\nentirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made\navailable on.\n\nLet's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate\nwhat this means.\n\nSteam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to\nthose games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform.\nAs a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games\nonline.\n\nWhen a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own,\nby the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If\nthe Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host\non their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical\nsituation.\n\nThat is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or\nnew feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop\nclient, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In\naddition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a\nParticl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus\ntransferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future\nParticl Desktop releases.\n\nAnd then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future\nplanned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by\nthe author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.\n\nUltimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly\ndependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and\ninefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an\nunmaintainable situation.\n\nThe new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent\ndApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the\nParticl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own\nterms.\n\nFaster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes\nRight now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire\nParticl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled\nout as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an\nentire client update or involve the Particl team.\n\nThat's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop\nclient itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets\nautomatically updated on all dApps that use that module.\n\nThis, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus\non the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and\nmanage their apps without relying on the team's actions.\n\nFor example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it\nwouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their\nnetwork. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module,\nensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with\nsecurity fixes.\n\nThis is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.\n\nIn Summary\nParticl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming\nthe Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for\nthe new internet.\n\nThis new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:\n\n 1. The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it\n    is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and\n    developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central\n    points of failure.\n 2. Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities,\n    dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building\n    everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of\n    mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.\n 3. DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl\n    ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.\n\n3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility\nOne of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve\naccessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone,\nwithout complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop\napplication for all purposes. This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a\ncritical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.\n\nAs such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate\nmodules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile\nframeworks or even into third-party applications.\n\nWeb Access\nHowever, as we’ve explored\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], hosting dApps on top\nof the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries\ncritical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we\nplan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s\ncontent hosting capabilities.\n\nIndeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a\ndistributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to\nsomething like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and\naccessed from web browsers.\n\nOf course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors,\nwe fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e.,\nParticl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end\nencrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such\nsolutions to provide more options to the end-user.\n\nA New Modular Particl Desktop\nJust like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular\nclient, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish.\nThis promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install\nevery Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.\n\nFor example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still\ncurrently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl\nDesktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all.\nStill, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer\nresources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).\n\nWith a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from\ntheir Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the\nfirst place.\n\nDApp Store\nTo promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a\nlist of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for\nindependent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.\n\nOf course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will\nbe a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As\nopen-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via\nother ways as well.\n\n4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism\nTo further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the\ninternet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by\nensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and\nprotocols. This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan.\n\nCurrency Agnosticism\nAs part of the range of modules available to developers will be\ncryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to\nsupport other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).\n\nAlthough not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and\nservices (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART\nprivacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other\ncryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.\n\nWhen a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap\nmodule, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap\ntheir coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as\na background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to\nseamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting\nthe user experience.\n\nIn the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit\ncard purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged\nby dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further\nbridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nProtocol Agnosticism\nBecause dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols\nthat are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.\n\nFor example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging\nmodule. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging\nprotocol, like matrix [https://matrix.org/], which powers the Element Messenger\n[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org]. This would still grant\nthe dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.\n\nThere are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols\nhave different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular\nprotocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This\ngives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is\nin the best interest of their users.\n\nSecondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As\ntechnology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol\ninnovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of\nprotocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability\nto seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other\nwords, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with\nthe most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what\nis possible at the time that they use a dApp.\n\nFinally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For\nexample, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp,\nits developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative.\nThis lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving\nthe integrity of the other components of a dApp.\n\nNew Particl dApps are Coming Around\nParticl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it\nenable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its\ndevelopment process to the world.\n\nMoreover, with Particl’s CCS platform [https://ccs.particl.io], anyone can\npublish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a\nfully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl\ncommunity is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is\ndeployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led\ninitiatives.\n\nThat being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps\nnot only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure\nbut also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.\n\nHere are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different\ncomponents of the modular infrastructure go live.\n\nNew version of the marketplace This development cycle changes the back-end of\nthe ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need\nto be deployed. \n\nMore flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the\nsame functionality but in a much more accessible way. In addition, the\nmarketplace will be designed so that its part, or its whole, can be integrated\ninto different access gateways like a website, mobile application, or\nthird-party integrations; all are cross-compatible. \n\nAlso, because of its cleaner, modular codebase, any future development, such as\nthe development of new features, will be dramatically sped up from the current\ntypical pace. \n\nin-progress waiting done Mobile version of the marketplace In just a few years,\nmobile devices are expected to be the preferential way people shop online. How\nmany times have any of us purchased goods on the internet using our phones?\nCountless times, we’re sure. \n\nThe reality, however, is different for sellers who, for the vast majority,\nmanage their business from desktop or laptop computers. \n\nThat is why one of Particl’s first dApps will be a buyer-focused mobile version\nof Particl Marketplace. This dApp will use the new modular approach of the\necosystem and showcase the use of a mobile access gateway into which Particl\ndApps will then be able to be integrated. \n\nin-progress waiting done Privacy-first messenger app Think Signal or Telegram,\nbut 100% decentralized and open-source. A privacy-first messenger application\ncould be deployed relatively easily on mobile and desktop environments.\nMoreover, because it only requires SMSG modules, such a dApp could likely become\navailable before even the release of the new version of the marketplace, as the\nlatter requires more modules to be put together in order to function and carries\na higher level of complexity. After all, because SMSG’s messaging capability is\nexpected to be used heavily in the future, it only makes sense to isolate it\ninto a proper standalone app or module early on. \n\nBesides, it will serve as an excellent showcase for the new SMSG 2.0 network and\nmobile access gateways. \n\nin-progress waiting done Standalone escrow app and integrations As a way to\ndemonstrate the integrability of modules, the Particl team may work on a\nshowcase in which a two-party escrow option becomes available on a new mobile\nwallet. \n\nAs we’ve discussed here\n[https://particl.news/an-overview-of-particls-two-party-escrow/], Particl’s\nnovel two-party escrow system has a wide range of use cases, all the way to\nin-person trade, and enabling this type of escrow outside of Particl Marketplace\nwill allow us to tap into and reach more of these possibilities. \n\nin-progress waiting done Third-party integrations The modular approach's\nintegration potential works in two ways: it, for one, allows Particl dApps to be\nintegrated into existing eCommerce platforms (i.e., a WooCommerce payment plugin\nwith two-party escrow contracts), but it also allows third-party services to be\nintegrated right into dApps as modules (i.e., a third-party inventory management\nsystem that a seller may be using on other platforms). \n\nAs such, you can expect, over time, a wide range of integrations to be made\navailable on the Particl dApp store or other popular platforms — in the form of\na WooCommerce plugin, for example. \n\nin-progress waiting done Timeline\nThis new major development cycle is expected to last from 12 to 18 months, with\nthe current team size, and start right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/].\n\nHowever, the team has recently actively been looking for external funding and\npitching to various investors. Following a successful funding round, we fully\nintend on growing the development team (as well as other departments like\nmarketing and community too) to fill various key positions that will\nsignificantly speed up the process.\n\nPlease refer to the roadmap below for a general overview of the path forward. As\nalways, as we're dealing with moving targets and pioneering entirely new\ntechnology, the roadmap is likely to be updated and adjusted as we go.\n\n> Note: We will publish the pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which we're\nboth using to pitch to investors, shortly into the future.\nFollow the Development Updates\nOnce this new major development cycle begins, right after the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.3, we will shift the focus from reporting development progress on\nParticl Desktop toward the greater Particl ecosystem. This will be reflected in\nthe way we report our weekly progress reports\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/].\n\nFAQ\nWill Particl Desktop, Marketplace, and BasicSwap DEX continue to function during\nthis new development cycle? Yes. The new versions of these products will be\nbuilt in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes\nto the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are\nbeing made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new\nversions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be\ndeprecated. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does adding the ability to use other coins within the\necosystem render PART useless? Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a\ncritical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional\nprivacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex\nParticl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses\nboth privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl\ndApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate. \n\nFor example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for\nMonero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s\ntwo-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a\npayment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero\nfor PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced\nmarketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting\nwith it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART. \n\nOn the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance,\nsending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application),\nthen it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the\npayment through PART. \n\nWe aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a\nsingle cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos.\nBy opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we\nsignificantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and\nsuccessfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all,\nthis is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n\nin-progress waiting done Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for\nmore centralization? Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and\neasy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in\ncoding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of\nParticl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at\nthe end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\"\nservice or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their\ndecision on what's best for them. \n\nNonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications,\ntheir inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of\ndecentralization. \n\nFirst, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by\ngiving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the\nworld. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl\ndevelopment team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very\neasy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically\nimproves the resilience of the network as a whole. \n\nSecondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively\nimpact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will\nbe possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize\nthem using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community\nthat often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl\nteam, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because\nof the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new\nevolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle. \n\nThe evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and\ngives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a\ncertain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the\ncommunity for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party\ndeveloper to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for\nalmost any Web3 developer. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does Particl have the funds required to make all of\nthat happen? Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of\ngrowth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this\ndevelopment cycle at the current pace. \n\nHowever, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external\ninvestors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and\naccelerate our progress. Although we cannot reveal more information about it at\nthis time, we will publish our pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which\nwe're both using to pitch, shortly into the future. \n\nin-progress waiting done How does the team expects to deliver on this with its\nsmall size? Any plans to grow the team? An aspect of this development cycle's\nstrategy is to grow the development team to help on the various components and\ndApp projects. But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of\nfunding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding.\nThis is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities. \n\nBesides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the\ndevelopment process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the\necosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and\nallow for more people to help the network grow. \n\nin-progress waiting done What about marketing in all of this? Again, the scale\nand timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding\nat the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly\ndevelopment-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have\ndifferent marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as\nfinancial capabilities permit. \n\nBut, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result\nin much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor\nthat affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better\nmarketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards\nfuture marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the\nhype of the marketing efforts that will promote them. \n\nIn addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target\naudiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team\nfully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually\nincreasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s\ncritical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major\nupdates. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace\ncould be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets? Yes. Even further, it\nmeans that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone.\nA cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into\nits own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made\nexclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee,\nthey could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to\nautomatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for\nlisting fees. \n\nIn fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party\nintegrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by\nreaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue\nfor the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved.\nThis will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy\nas we incrementally release new products. \n\nin-progress waiting done Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated? No,\nSMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0\ncomes out. Instead, they will run parallel to each other as their differences\nmake up for varying pros and cons, which may be better suited for different\nuse-cases. \n\nin-progress waiting done How long is this development cycle expected to last? \nDelivering the envisioned future of Particl in full is no small task and is\nexpected to last 12 to 18 months, assuming no additional (external) source of\nfunding for the team. However, this time estimate will likely improve as we\ngradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful\nfunding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working\nthrough this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned\nseveral incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the\nentire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different\nexciting releases to keep things very interesting. \n\nFor example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl\nMarketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it\nuses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time.\nThat’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different\nmodules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n\nIn the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much\nsimpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would\nbe much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG\nis expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy\nit early on into the process. \n\nin-progress waiting done","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

With Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and publicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply look for the entirety of your information in public records.</p><p>Case in point, here are <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth\">the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user</a>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0\">their detailed financial history</a>, <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth\">as well as all the NFTs they own</a>. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at the time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is permanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is able to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and future financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the “economy or internet of tomorrow”.</p><p>What’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such as we’ve seen with <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">Infura, MetaMask</a>, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/\">NFT marketplace OpenSea</a>.</p><p>With so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3 succeed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not living up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online privacy and security compared to even Web2.</p><p>In reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but rather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its mission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the sheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most critical foundations of Web3.</p><p>Indeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web can be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional web infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it unfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.</p><p><strong><em>Particl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right direction.</em></strong></p><h3 id=\"building-the-right-foundation\">Building the Right Foundation</h3><p>Particl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by granting it <strong>a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first decentralized applications can be deployed</strong>.</p><p>By leveraging the firepower of an <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf\">ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers</a> and giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and open-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to fight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create a parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center — simultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them from the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and all the consequences it brings forth.</p><h2 id=\"announcing-particl-s-new-major-development-cycle\">Announcing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle</h2><p>In a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the ecosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure, ultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use privacy-first dApps.</p><p>Before we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important to understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of Particl’s strengths and what makes it unique.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-unique\">What Makes Particl Unique?</h3><p>Particl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a unique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the SecureMessaging network (SMSG).</p><h4 id=\"particl-blockchain\">Particl Blockchain </h4><p>The Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both various privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot, etc) as well as a high level of flexibility.</p><p>While its native cryptocurrency, PART, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\">allows for untraceable payments to be made (privacy coin)</a>, the blockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and privacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless scripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique convergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the Particl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry with an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Marketplace</a> or <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap DEX</a>.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people within the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend to be less widely known.

Inspired by the<a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\"> BitMessage protocol</a>, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>In other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and users themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much more complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart contracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"particl-s-four-pillars-for-the-new-digital-world\">Particl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World</h2><p>Particl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a decentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps that protect the rights and liberties of its users.</p><p>Compared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms of the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for the good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and society as a whole.</p><p>The strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:</p><ol><li><a href=\"#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")</a></li><li><a href=\"#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\">Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=\"#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to host decentralized applications and interact with them</a></li><li><a href=\"#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\">Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy</a></li></ol><p>Let's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more detail.</p><h2 id=\"1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol</h2><p>A big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">data transmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network</a>, which runs in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes possible more advanced features and functionality than traditional smart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap DEX dApps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True Privacy</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about what makes Particl decentralized applications truly special and private!</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/6b2dad3b47be647f145e4bbace6c1950/smsg_network-medium-2.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>But while the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way to communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive levels of simultaneous usage.</p><p>Additionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making it more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet infrastructure.</p><p>And so, the <strong>first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to make it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality</strong> — essentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.</p><h3 id=\"an-open-and-decentralized-web-architecture\">An Open and Decentralized Web Architecture</h3><p>To get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It is true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities we need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how much usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code implementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the way it is built.</p><p>That’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the mission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.</p><h4 id=\"distributed-web-content-and-dapp-hosting\">Distributed Web Content and dApp Hosting</h4><p>A critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data but also <strong>host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps</strong> — entirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide web”).</p><p>To put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming SMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and privacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.</p><p>With dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed network, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of our current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over the past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely censorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from any interference from central parties.</p><h4 id=\"near-infinite-scalability\">Near-Infinite Scalability</h4><p>To be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of tomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially increasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl dApps).</p><p>This feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes. Whereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes — with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the messages’ content — <strong>SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured fashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic</strong>.</p><p>This effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And as more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a sufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in adoption requires.</p><h2 id=\"2-a-new-modular-architecture\">2. A New Modular Architecture</h2><p><strong>The second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new modular dimension.</strong> Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a significant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of pioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services — we’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient, and that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-current-infrastructure\">Particl’s Current Infrastructure</h3><p>Unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not as open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost exclusively on the Particl team.</p><p>Even in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by building a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full cooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s main access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need to keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.</p><p>In reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t as much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl Marketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of Particl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.</p><h4 id=\"cooperation-requirements-for-dapp-maintenance-and-integration\">Cooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration</h4><p>One of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic. Even though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent from Particl Desktop, it is not.</p><p>Indeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl Desktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In that sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than a standalone dApp.</p><p>Particl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much greater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access gateways (Particl Desktop).</p><h4 id=\"enabling-the-ability-to-re-use-functionality-already-implemented-on-other-dapps\">Enabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps</h4><p>Not only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the Particl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps into their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key functionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.</p><p>Let’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded developer wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the messaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would instantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of SMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to communicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.</p><p>Because even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be hard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of desired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires to be re-implemented all over again.</p><p>Again, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one dApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new, parallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.</p><h3 id=\"introducing-particl-modules-and-the-developer-sdk\">Introducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK</h3><p>To remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from now on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its ecosystem into a set of developer-friendly <strong>modules</strong> that can be added, removed, configured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX) or an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.</p><h4 id=\"modules\">Modules</h4><p>In this context, a<strong> module </strong>refers to a<strong> readily-available packaged set of code, libraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an external environment (i.e., a dApp)</strong>. They grant dApps critical and/or common Particl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp unique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex functions.</p><h4 id=\"developer-sdk\">Developer SDK</h4><p>Particl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a <strong>standardized set of development tools and documentation</strong>. Not only does the SDK improve dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely implemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to build privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that developers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a structured and standardized way.</p><h4 id=\"access-gateways\">Access gateways</h4><p>This term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is accessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or SMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.</p><h3 id=\"the-mobile-apps-vs-particl-dapps-comparison\">The Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison</h3><p>A good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing Particl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile applications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not need direct access to the underlying hardware features.</p><p>Instead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests permission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to third-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to re-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely requests this functionality from the OS.<br>This, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them provides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.</p><p>Not only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside contributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient against outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the way dApps are developed and maintained.</p><h3 id=\"deploying-particl-s-key-modules\">Deploying Particl’s Key Modules</h3><p>Among the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into modules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark on this new development phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Blockchain node modules</strong> (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Payment module</strong> (to provide payment solutions)</li><li><strong>Market-related modules</strong> (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)</li><li><strong>Two-party escrow system</strong> (to provide trade assurance)</li><li><strong>SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat</strong> (for safe communications)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized storage</strong> (to store data online)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized hosting</strong> (to host web content and dApps)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Controller module</strong> (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG messages (back-end services for developers))</li><li><strong>Swap modules</strong> (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Staking module</strong> (to integrate PART staking capabilities)</li><li><strong>Third-party integrations</strong> (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP, i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)</li></ul><p>Note that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be isolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical ones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-this-benefit-particl\">How Does This Benefit Particl?</h3><p>The ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the success of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.</p><h4 id=\"makes-development-easier-and-increases-production-pace\">Makes development easier and increases production pace</h4><p>With a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to develop an application when not having to deal with various setup and maintenance burdens.</p><p>Currently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the client, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client fits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other built-in apps.</p><p>For example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the marketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply because it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how Particl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the messaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work required and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development burden to maintain.</p><p>This type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into an independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply request an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead of creating it from scratch.</p><p>This will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate community contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to build dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.</p><h4 id=\"make-dapp-maintenance-independent-from-the-particl-team-or-platform-they-re-hosted-on\">Make dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re hosted on</h4><p>Adding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps entirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made available on.</p><p>Let's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate what this means.</p><p>Steam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to those games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform. As a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games online.</p><p>When a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own, by the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If the Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host on their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical situation.</p><p>That is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or new feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop client, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In addition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a Particl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus transferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future Particl Desktop releases.</p><p>And then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future planned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by the author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.</p><p>Ultimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly dependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an unmaintainable situation.</p><p>The new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent dApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the Particl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own terms.</p><h4 id=\"faster-rollout-for-updates-new-features-and-bug-fixes\">Faster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes</h4><p>Right now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire Particl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled out as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an entire client update or involve the Particl team.</p><p>That's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop client itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets automatically updated on all dApps that use that module.</p><p>This, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus on the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and manage their apps without relying on the team's actions.</p><p>For example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it wouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their network. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module, ensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with security fixes.</p><p>This is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.</p><h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3><p>Particl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming the Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for the new internet.</p><p>This new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:</p><ol><li>The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central points of failure.</li><li>Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities, dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.</li><li>DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.</li></ol><h2 id=\"3-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</h2><p>One of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve accessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone, without complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop application for all purposes. <strong>This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a critical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.</strong></p><p>As such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate modules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile frameworks or even into third-party applications.</p><h3 id=\"web-access\">Web Access</h3><p>However, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve explored</a>, hosting dApps on top of the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries critical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we plan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s content hosting capabilities.</p><p>Indeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a distributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to something like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and accessed from web browsers.</p><p>Of course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors, we fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end encrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such solutions to provide more options to the end-user.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-modular-particl-desktop\">A New Modular Particl Desktop</h3><p>Just like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular client, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish. This promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install every Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.</p><p>For example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still currently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl Desktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all. Still, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer resources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).</p><p>With a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from their Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the first place.</p><h4 id=\"dapp-store\">DApp Store</h4><p>To promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a list of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for independent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.</p><p>Of course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will be a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As open-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via other ways as well.</p><h2 id=\"4-currency-and-protocol-agnosticism\">4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</h2><p>To further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the internet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by ensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and protocols. <strong>This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism</h3><p>As part of the range of modules available to developers will be cryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to support other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).</p><p>Although not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and services (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART privacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other cryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.</p><p>When a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap module, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap their coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as a background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to seamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting the user experience.</p><p>In the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged by dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further bridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol Agnosticism</h3><p>Because dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols that are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.</p><p>For example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging module. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging protocol, like <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">matrix</a>, which powers the <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org\">Element Messenger</a>. This would still grant the dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.</p><p>There are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols have different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular protocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This gives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is in the best interest of their users.</p><p>Secondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As technology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol innovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of protocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability to seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other words, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with the most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what is possible at the time that they use a dApp.</p><p>Finally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For example, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp, its developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative. This lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving the integrity of the other components of a dApp.</p><h2 id=\"new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">New Particl dApps are Coming Around</h2><p>Particl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities.

The new versions of these products will be built in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes to the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are being made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new versions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be deprecated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Does adding the ability to use other coins within the ecosystem render PART useless?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a critical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional privacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex Particl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses both privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl dApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for Monero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s two-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a payment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero for PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced marketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting with it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART.\n            <br><br>\n            On the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance, sending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application), then it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the payment through PART.\n            <br><br>\n            We aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a single cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos. By opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we significantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and successfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all, this is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck4\">Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for more centralization?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and easy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in coding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of Particl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at the end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\" service or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their decision on what's best for them.\n            <br><br>\n            Nonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications, their inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of decentralization.\n            <br><br>\n            First, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by giving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the world. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl development team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very easy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically improves the resilience of the network as a whole.\n            <br><br>\n            Secondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively impact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will be possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize them using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community that often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl team, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because of the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new evolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle.\n            <br><br>\n            The evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and gives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a certain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the community for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party developer to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for almost any Web3 developer.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck6\">Does Particl have the funds required to make all of that happen?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of growth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this development cycle at the current pace.\n            <br><br>\n            However, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external investors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and accelerate our progress. Although we cannot reveal more information about it at this time, we will publish our pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which we're both using to pitch, shortly into the future.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck7\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck7\">How does the team expects to deliver on this with its small size? Any plans to grow the team?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            An aspect of this development cycle's strategy is to grow the development team to help on the various components and dApp projects. But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of funding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding. This is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the development process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the ecosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and allow for more people to help the network grow. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck8\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck8\">What about marketing in all of this?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Again, the scale and timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding at the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly development-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have different marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as financial capabilities permit.\n            <br><br>\n            But, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result in much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor that affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better marketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards future marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the hype of the marketing efforts that will promote them.\n            <br><br>\n            In addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target audiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team fully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually increasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s critical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major updates.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck9\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck9\">Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace could be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Yes. Even further, it means that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone. A cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into its own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made exclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee, they could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to automatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for listing fees. \n            <br><br>\n            In fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party integrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by reaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue for the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved. This will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy as we incrementally release new products.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck10\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck10\">Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            No, SMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0 comes out.

However, this time estimate will likely improve as we gradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful funding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working through this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned several incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the entire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different exciting releases to keep things very interesting.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl Marketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it uses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time. That’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different modules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n            <br><br>\n            In the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much simpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would be much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG is expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy it early on into the process.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html-->","url":"http://localhost:2368/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"d25c43aa-687c-423a-8918-0d276a3c8800","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62e1e75c910c1554f0dd5b4e","reading_time":30,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w, /glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

With the web now having such a prevalent place in our society, this crisis ends up bleeding into every single aspect of our lives — it affects not only our finances but also our private communications, our personal and professional lives, and our ability to do almost anything online.</p><p>Gone are the days of what once was a free and open web. Instead, as we’ve recently explored in various <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/stories/\">Particl Stories</a>, there is a worryingly increasing trend in the rate of censorship, <a href=\"https://particl.news/unhosted-wallets-and-the-fight-against-out-of-touch-policies/\">geo-political meddling</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">big tech abuses</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-need-for-an-open-source-revolution/\">reckless data mining</a>, and various agenda-driven actions by the Internet’s largest platform operators.</p><p>Undoubtedly, we, as individuals, need to stand up to this takeover and take back control of our web. We need to reassert and safeguard our rights to an open, free, and private web environment, as it was originally intended to be, and be the change we want to see in this world!</p><p>Whereas certain governments, corporations, or other types of organizations continue to elevate their level of control and power using the current web infrastructure, there is a growing need to stop fighting on their own turf and, instead, pioneer the digital world of tomorrow in which the rights and freedoms of each individual are guaranteed.</p><p>When accessible and easy to use, disruptive technology — as is the case with Particl’s privacy-first dApps — becomes both a shield and a weapon, protecting us from digital abuse but also striking back by allowing people to thrive without interference from the current centralized web infrastructure.</p><h3 id=\"the-shortcomings-of-web3\">The Shortcomings of Web3</h3><p>That is, in essence, what Web3 promised to accomplish: a more open, independent, and free internet for all. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve come to discover</a>, what Web3 promises and what it currently delivers diverges on many fronts. If you dive into its present state, you can see that it’s much more centralized than it first appears — relying, in major parts, on traditional “big tech” infrastructure — and that it turns out to be a near disaster in terms of privacy and decentralization.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Web3 Exposed!

On the latter, only a few parties can access your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the payment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners. With Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and publicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply look for the entirety of your information in public records.</p><p>Case in point, here are <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth\">the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user</a>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0\">their detailed financial history</a>, <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth\">as well as all the NFTs they own</a>. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at the time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is permanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is able to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and future financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the “economy or internet of tomorrow”.</p><p>What’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such as we’ve seen with <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">Infura, MetaMask</a>, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/\">NFT marketplace OpenSea</a>.</p><p>With so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3 succeed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not living up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online privacy and security compared to even Web2.</p><p>In reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but rather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its mission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the sheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most critical foundations of Web3.</p><p>Indeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web can be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional web infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it unfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.</p><p><strong><em>Particl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right direction.</em></strong></p><h3 id=\"building-the-right-foundation\">Building the Right Foundation</h3><p>Particl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by granting it <strong>a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first decentralized applications can be deployed</strong>.</p><p>By leveraging the firepower of an <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf\">ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers</a> and giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and open-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to fight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create a parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center — simultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them from the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and all the consequences it brings forth.</p><h2 id=\"announcing-particl-s-new-major-development-cycle\">Announcing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle</h2><p>In a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the ecosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure, ultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use privacy-first dApps.</p><p>Before we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important to understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of Particl’s strengths and what makes it unique.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-unique\">What Makes Particl Unique?</h3><p>Particl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a unique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the SecureMessaging network (SMSG).</p><h4 id=\"particl-blockchain\">Particl Blockchain </h4><p>The Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both various privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot, etc) as well as a high level of flexibility.</p><p>While its native cryptocurrency, PART, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\">allows for untraceable payments to be made (privacy coin)</a>, the blockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and privacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless scripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique convergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the Particl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry with an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Marketplace</a> or <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap DEX</a>.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people within the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend to be less widely known. You can learn more about them </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#scriptless-scripts\"><em>here</em></a><em> or by reading this </em><a href=\"https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts\"><em>in-depth guide</em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><h4 id=\"securemessaging-network-smsg-\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</h4><p>SecureMessaging (SMSG) is a P2P mixnet that allows peers to communicate encrypted data with other peers or applications without the need for third parties or middlemen. Inspired by the<a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\"> BitMessage protocol</a>, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>In other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and users themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much more complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart contracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"particl-s-four-pillars-for-the-new-digital-world\">Particl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World</h2><p>Particl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a decentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps that protect the rights and liberties of its users.</p><p>Compared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms of the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for the good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and society as a whole.</p><p>The strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:</p><ol><li><a href=\"#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")</a></li><li><a href=\"#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\">Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=\"#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to host decentralized applications and interact with them</a></li><li><a href=\"#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\">Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy</a></li></ol><p>Let's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more detail.</p><h2 id=\"1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol</h2><p>A big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">data transmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network</a>, which runs in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes possible more advanced features and functionality than traditional smart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap DEX dApps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True Privacy</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about what makes Particl decentralized applications truly special and private!</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/6b2dad3b47be647f145e4bbace6c1950/smsg_network-medium-2.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>But while the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way to communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive levels of simultaneous usage.</p><p>Additionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making it more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet infrastructure.</p><p>And so, the <strong>first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to make it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality</strong> — essentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.</p><h3 id=\"an-open-and-decentralized-web-architecture\">An Open and Decentralized Web Architecture</h3><p>To get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It is true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities we need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how much usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code implementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the way it is built.</p><p>That’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the mission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.</p><h4 id=\"distributed-web-content-and-dapp-hosting\">Distributed Web Content and dApp Hosting</h4><p>A critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data but also <strong>host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps</strong> — entirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide web”).</p><p>To put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming SMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and privacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.</p><p>With dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed network, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of our current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over the past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely censorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from any interference from central parties.</p><h4 id=\"near-infinite-scalability\">Near-Infinite Scalability</h4><p>To be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of tomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially increasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl dApps).</p><p>This feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes. Whereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes — with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the messages’ content — <strong>SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured fashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic</strong>.</p><p>This effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And as more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a sufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in adoption requires.</p><h2 id=\"2-a-new-modular-architecture\">2. A New Modular Architecture</h2><p><strong>The second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new modular dimension.</strong> Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a significant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of pioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services — we’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient, and that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-current-infrastructure\">Particl’s Current Infrastructure</h3><p>Unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not as open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost exclusively on the Particl team.</p><p>Even in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by building a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full cooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s main access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need to keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.</p><p>In reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t as much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl Marketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of Particl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.</p><h4 id=\"cooperation-requirements-for-dapp-maintenance-and-integration\">Cooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration</h4><p>One of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic. Even though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent from Particl Desktop, it is not.</p><p>Indeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl Desktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In that sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than a standalone dApp.</p><p>Particl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much greater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access gateways (Particl Desktop).</p><h4 id=\"enabling-the-ability-to-re-use-functionality-already-implemented-on-other-dapps\">Enabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps</h4><p>Not only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the Particl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps into their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key functionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.</p><p>Let’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded developer wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the messaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would instantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of SMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to communicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.</p><p>Because even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be hard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of desired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires to be re-implemented all over again.</p><p>Again, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one dApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new, parallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.</p><h3 id=\"introducing-particl-modules-and-the-developer-sdk\">Introducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK</h3><p>To remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from now on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its ecosystem into a set of developer-friendly <strong>modules</strong> that can be added, removed, configured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX) or an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.</p><h4 id=\"modules\">Modules</h4><p>In this context, a<strong> module </strong>refers to a<strong> readily-available packaged set of code, libraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an external environment (i.e., a dApp)</strong>. They grant dApps critical and/or common Particl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp unique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex functions.</p><h4 id=\"developer-sdk\">Developer SDK</h4><p>Particl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a <strong>standardized set of development tools and documentation</strong>. Not only does the SDK improve dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely implemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to build privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that developers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a structured and standardized way.</p><h4 id=\"access-gateways\">Access gateways</h4><p>This term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is accessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or SMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.</p><h3 id=\"the-mobile-apps-vs-particl-dapps-comparison\">The Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison</h3><p>A good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing Particl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile applications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not need direct access to the underlying hardware features.</p><p>Instead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests permission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to third-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to re-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely requests this functionality from the OS.<br>This, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them provides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.</p><p>Not only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside contributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient against outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the way dApps are developed and maintained.</p><h3 id=\"deploying-particl-s-key-modules\">Deploying Particl’s Key Modules</h3><p>Among the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into modules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark on this new development phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Blockchain node modules</strong> (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Payment module</strong> (to provide payment solutions)</li><li><strong>Market-related modules</strong> (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)</li><li><strong>Two-party escrow system</strong> (to provide trade assurance)</li><li><strong>SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat</strong> (for safe communications)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized storage</strong> (to store data online)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized hosting</strong> (to host web content and dApps)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Controller module</strong> (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG messages (back-end services for developers))</li><li><strong>Swap modules</strong> (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Staking module</strong> (to integrate PART staking capabilities)</li><li><strong>Third-party integrations</strong> (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP, i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)</li></ul><p>Note that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be isolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical ones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-this-benefit-particl\">How Does This Benefit Particl?</h3><p>The ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the success of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.</p><h4 id=\"makes-development-easier-and-increases-production-pace\">Makes development easier and increases production pace</h4><p>With a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to develop an application when not having to deal with various setup and maintenance burdens.</p><p>Currently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the client, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client fits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other built-in apps.</p><p>For example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the marketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply because it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how Particl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the messaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work required and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development burden to maintain.</p><p>This type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into an independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply request an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead of creating it from scratch.</p><p>This will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate community contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to build dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.</p><h4 id=\"make-dapp-maintenance-independent-from-the-particl-team-or-platform-they-re-hosted-on\">Make dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re hosted on</h4><p>Adding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps entirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made available on.</p><p>Let's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate what this means.</p><p>Steam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to those games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform. As a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games online.</p><p>When a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own, by the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If the Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host on their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical situation.</p><p>That is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or new feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop client, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In addition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a Particl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus transferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future Particl Desktop releases.</p><p>And then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future planned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by the author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.</p><p>Ultimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly dependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an unmaintainable situation.</p><p>The new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent dApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the Particl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own terms.</p><h4 id=\"faster-rollout-for-updates-new-features-and-bug-fixes\">Faster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes</h4><p>Right now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire Particl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled out as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an entire client update or involve the Particl team.</p><p>That's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop client itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets automatically updated on all dApps that use that module.</p><p>This, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus on the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and manage their apps without relying on the team's actions.</p><p>For example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it wouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their network. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module, ensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with security fixes.</p><p>This is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.</p><h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3><p>Particl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming the Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for the new internet.</p><p>This new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:</p><ol><li>The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central points of failure.</li><li>Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities, dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.</li><li>DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.</li></ol><h2 id=\"3-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</h2><p>One of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve accessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone, without complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop application for all purposes. <strong>This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a critical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.</strong></p><p>As such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate modules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile frameworks or even into third-party applications.</p><h3 id=\"web-access\">Web Access</h3><p>However, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve explored</a>, hosting dApps on top of the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries critical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we plan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s content hosting capabilities.</p><p>Indeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a distributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to something like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and accessed from web browsers.</p><p>Of course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors, we fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end encrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such solutions to provide more options to the end-user.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-modular-particl-desktop\">A New Modular Particl Desktop</h3><p>Just like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular client, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish. This promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install every Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.</p><p>For example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still currently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl Desktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all. Still, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer resources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).</p><p>With a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from their Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the first place.</p><h4 id=\"dapp-store\">DApp Store</h4><p>To promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a list of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for independent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.</p><p>Of course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will be a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As open-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via other ways as well.</p><h2 id=\"4-currency-and-protocol-agnosticism\">4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</h2><p>To further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the internet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by ensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and protocols. <strong>This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism</h3><p>As part of the range of modules available to developers will be cryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to support other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).</p><p>Although not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and services (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART privacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other cryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.</p><p>When a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap module, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap their coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as a background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to seamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting the user experience.</p><p>In the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged by dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further bridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol Agnosticism</h3><p>Because dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols that are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.</p><p>For example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging module. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging protocol, like <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">matrix</a>, which powers the <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org\">Element Messenger</a>. This would still grant the dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.</p><p>There are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols have different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular protocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This gives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is in the best interest of their users.</p><p>Secondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As technology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol innovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of protocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability to seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other words, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with the most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what is possible at the time that they use a dApp.</p><p>Finally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For example, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp, its developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative. This lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving the integrity of the other components of a dApp.</p><h2 id=\"new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">New Particl dApps are Coming Around</h2><p>Particl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it enable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its development process to the world.</p><p>Moreover, with <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">Particl’s CCS platform</a>, anyone can publish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a fully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl community is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is deployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led initiatives.</p><p>That being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps not only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure but also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.</p><p>Here are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different components of the modular infrastructure go live.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">New version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            This development cycle changes the back-end of the ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need to be deployed.\n            <br><br>\n            More flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the same functionality but in a much more accessible way. In addition, the marketplace will be designed so that its part, or its whole, can be integrated into different access gateways like a website, mobile application, or third-party integrations; all are cross-compatible.\n            <br><br>\n            Also, because of its cleaner, modular codebase, any future development, such as the development of new features, will be dramatically sped up from the current typical pace.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Mobile version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            In just a few years, mobile devices are expected to be the preferential way people shop online.

Countless times, we’re sure.\n            <br><br>\n            The reality, however, is different for sellers who, for the vast majority, manage their business from desktop or laptop computers.\n            <br><br>\n            That is why one of Particl’s first dApps will be a buyer-focused mobile version of Particl Marketplace. This dApp will use the new modular approach of the ecosystem and showcase the use of a mobile access gateway into which Particl dApps will then be able to be integrated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck4\">Privacy-first messenger app</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Think Signal or Telegram, but 100% decentralized and open-source. A privacy-first messenger application could be deployed relatively easily on mobile and desktop environments. Moreover, because it only requires SMSG modules, such a dApp could likely become available before even the release of the new version of the marketplace, as the latter requires more modules to be put together in order to function and carries a higher level of complexity. After all, because SMSG’s messaging capability is expected to be used heavily in the future, it only makes sense to isolate it into a proper standalone app or module early on.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, it will serve as an excellent showcase for the new SMSG 2.0 network and mobile access gateways.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Standalone escrow app and integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            As a way to demonstrate the integrability of modules, the Particl team may work on a showcase in which a two-party escrow option becomes available on a new mobile wallet.\n            <br><br>\n            As we’ve discussed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/an-overview-of-particls-two-party-escrow/\">here</a>, Particl’s novel two-party escrow system has a wide range of use cases, all the way to in-person trade, and enabling this type of escrow outside of Particl Marketplace will allow us to tap into and reach more of these possibilities.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck6\">Third-party integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            The modular approach's integration potential works in two ways: it, for one, allows Particl dApps to be integrated into existing eCommerce platforms (i.e., a WooCommerce payment plugin with two-party escrow contracts), but it also allows third-party services to be integrated right into dApps as modules (i.e., a third-party inventory management system that a seller may be using on other platforms).\n            <br><br>\n            As such, you can expect, over time, a wide range of integrations to be made available on the Particl dApp store or other popular platforms — in the form of a WooCommerce plugin, for example.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h1><p>This new major development cycle is expected to last from 12 to 18 months, with the current team size, and start right after the release of <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/\">Particl Desktop 3.3</a>.</p><p>However, the team has recently actively been looking for external funding and pitching to various investors.

The new versions of these products will be built in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes to the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are being made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new versions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be deprecated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Does adding the ability to use other coins within the ecosystem render PART useless?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a critical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional privacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex Particl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses both privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl dApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for Monero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s two-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a payment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero for PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced marketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting with it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART.\n            <br><br>\n            On the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance, sending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application), then it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the payment through PART.\n            <br><br>\n            We aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a single cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos. By opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we significantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and successfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all, this is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck4\">Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for more centralization?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and easy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in coding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of Particl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at the end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\" service or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their decision on what's best for them.\n            <br><br>\n            Nonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications, their inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of decentralization.\n            <br><br>\n            First, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by giving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the world. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl development team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very easy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically improves the resilience of the network as a whole.\n            <br><br>\n            Secondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively impact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will be possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize them using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community that often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl team, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because of the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new evolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle.\n            <br><br>\n            The evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and gives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a certain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the community for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party developer to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for almost any Web3 developer.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck6\">Does Particl have the funds required to make all of that happen?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of growth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this development cycle at the current pace.\n            <br><br>\n            However, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external investors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and accelerate our progress.

But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of funding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding. This is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the development process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the ecosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and allow for more people to help the network grow. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck8\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck8\">What about marketing in all of this?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Again, the scale and timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding at the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly development-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have different marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as financial capabilities permit.\n            <br><br>\n            But, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result in much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor that affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better marketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards future marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the hype of the marketing efforts that will promote them.\n            <br><br>\n            In addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target audiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team fully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually increasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s critical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major updates.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck9\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck9\">Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace could be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Yes. Even further, it means that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone. A cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into its own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made exclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee, they could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to automatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for listing fees. \n            <br><br>\n            In fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party integrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by reaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue for the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved. This will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy as we incrementally release new products.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck10\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck10\">Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            No, SMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0 comes out. Instead, they will run parallel to each other as their differences make up for varying pros and cons, which may be better suited for different use-cases.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck11\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck11\">How long is this development cycle expected to last?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Delivering the envisioned future of Particl in full is no small task and is expected to last 12 to 18 months, assuming no additional (external) source of funding for the team. However, this time estimate will likely improve as we gradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful funding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working through this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned several incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the entire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different exciting releases to keep things very interesting.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl Marketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it uses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time. That’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different modules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n            <br><br>\n            In the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much simpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would be much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG is expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy it early on into the process.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html-->","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":"","srcSet":["/glink/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w","/glink/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w","/glink/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w","/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w"],"sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

This is the case for its Particl Marketplace, which allows anyone\nin the world to buy and sell goods and services, physical or digital, in total\nprivacy.\n\n The marketplace dApp uses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning\nthat it is run in an entirely distributed way from start to finish — no\nthird-party or intermediary ever has any sort of centralized role or control\nover its network. \n\nThis, by design, ensures the highest levels of privacy and security for the\nnetwork as a whole and is radically resistant to censorship. Particl\nMarketplace’s unique and sophisticated escrow system abides by these same\nprinciples, presenting many users with substantial benefits.\n\nThe Need for an Escrow model\nA staple of online market environments is the presence of an escrow system: when\ntrading with strangers, users need to be confident that the other party will\nkeep their end of the agreement and act in good faith throughout. That is why\ncontract security and enforcement are essential when trading goods and services\nin any marketplace.\n\n\nOne common solution eCommerce platforms and payment processors use is a\nmutually-trusted third party — in other words, an escrow agent or “issue\nresolution center”. In the context of a decentralized marketplace, this incurs a\ncritical problem: the introduction of a centralized moderating entity. It also\nattracts its own privacy issues as well as some economic drawbacks. Let’s\nexplore what this means for Particl Marketplace.\n\nCommon Issues With Traditional Escrow Models\nWith traditional escrow, a third-party (the escrow agent) holds onto an asset\nand releases it when the transaction is completed (i.e., the purchased item is\ndelivered). That role is generally assumed by the marketplace or exchange itself\n(i.e., Amazon, Openbazaar), a payment processor (i.e., Paypal, Visa), or\nthird-party escrow services (i.e., a bank or a financial institution). This\nallows potential disputes or issues to be safely settled, but it also carries\nimportant issues.\n\nFirstly, running escrow or issue resolution services incurs a heavy cost\nreflected in the platform's fees. When added to every link of a supply chain,\nthis fee ends up substantially impacting retail prices and making up a large\nportion of the final price of nearly all products we buy daily.\n\nAdditionally, when an issue arises, it is usually settled according to a very\nrigid set of policies rather than being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. This\nallows for more issues to be resolved quickly and efficiently but can also lead\nto biased resolutions that benefit the operator's own bottom line. In turn,\nscammers have perfected the art of defeating these hard-set policies to steal\nmoney, products, or both, from rule-abiding users and sellers. Online merchants\nare well aware of this problem and hedge their exposure to this risk through\ntheir prices, an unfortunate reality that the customer is ultimately led to bear\nthe costs.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, these solutions offer no privacy at all\nto their users and incur intrusive data requirements due to the operator needing\nto be aware of every detail related to a single transaction to fulfill its role.\nThis gives them complete oversight and insight over all the sensitive and, at\ntimes, confidential, personal, professional, financial, and commercial data\ncollected from the platform's users — which they, in turn, can use in accordance\nwith their interests, often to the detriment of the individuals and businesses\nusing the platform\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/].\n\nParticl’s Two-Party Online Escrow Solution\nParticl adopts a radically different escrow model which addresses the issues\nmentioned above. Often dubbed a “two-party escrow\", or \"MAD escrow\", it involves\nonly two parties; the buyer and the seller, with no one else in between.\n\nInstead of requiring a third party to hold the payment on behalf of two\ntransacting parties, both participants are required to provide collateral by\nmaking an equal security deposit into a smart-contract. This security deposit\ncan be adjusted from 0 to 100% of the total value of the item or service sold\nand is automatically refunded, in its entirety, once both parties mark the\ntransaction as completed. Notably, this form of decentralized escrow is\ninfinitely scalable, as there are no operating costs associated with running\nthese types of cryptographically-enforced contracts and no escrow agents\nrequired for it to function.\n\nIf a dispute or issue arises, both parties need to mutually agree on a\nsatisfying resolution for the transaction to be marked as complete. Because the\ntwo parties have a security deposit locked into the escrow smart-contract, they\nare naturally forced to collaborate and reach a reasonable resolution for both. \nThis method of escrow allows the Particl marketplace to preserve the privacy of\neveryone involved in every instance.\n\nAnother important but often overlooked advantage of two-party escrows involves\nsellers and cash flow. Although 2-of-2 escrow demands a security deposit, which\nmay, on first thought, appear as a cash flow-inhibiting process, it is\ncompletely shielded from assets being frozen by entities like Amazon or Paypal\n[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/paypal-stole-users-money-after-freezing-seizing-funds-lawsuit-alleges/] \nin the event of a dispute or perceived terms of use violations. Unfortunately,\nthis is an extremely common reality for providers of services and goods on those\nplatforms and can cause assets to remain in limbo for up to 6 months or even\npermanently\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/jyeeyh/will_there_ever_be_a_paypal_option_to_pay/]\n. For many sellers, such a risk could prove fatal to their business\n[https://realbusiness.co.uk/paypal-is-becoming-toxic-to-small-business].\n\nMutually Assured Destruction Game Theory\nBy definition, game theory simply refers to the study of mathematical models of\nstrategic interaction among rational decision-makers\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory]. In other words, it incentivizes\nrational decision-making and simultaneously disincentivizes irrational/dishonest\nbehavior.\n\nTo accomplish that desired outcome within the context of a two-party escrow\nsystem, Particl leverages the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) game theory in\na financial context. “MAD” is a military doctrine “based on the theory of\ndeterrence, which stipulates that the threat of using strong weapons against the\nenemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of\nNash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to\ninitiate a conflict or to disarm” (Wikipedia\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction]).\n\nBy combining Particl’s implementation of BIP 65\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki] , which allows\na transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future, with\nthe advanced trustless data transmission capabilities of the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], the\nmarketplace’s two-party escrow system locks funds in a secure multi-signature\nsmart-contract until all parties sign off on the transaction. This also\nencourages communication and negotiation between buyers and sellers if a\ntransaction goes wrong.\n\nThe result: Enabling Total Privacy in the Business World\nOne of Particl’s two-party escrow’s unique functionality resides in how it keeps\nall aspects of every transaction private-by-default. When you protect a\nmarketplace trade with the escrow system, you ensure that all data and\ninformation related to the transaction and its participants remain anonymous to\noutside observers. This is made possible by the complete absence of\nthird-parties involved, as well as the escrow’s smart contract itself being\nbuilt with some of the latest privacy technologies to guarantee anonymity down\nto the protocol level.\n\nIndeed, as we’ve mentioned above, Particl’s two-party escrow system leverages a\ncombination of its unique SMSG network as well as the BIP 65 proposal\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki] originally\nimplemented on Bitcoin. But that in itself is not enough to offer a satisfactory\nlevel of privacy; it merely allows trustless escrow transactions to take place.\n\nTo provide the escrow contract with the required privacy, payments and security\ndeposits are sent as “Confidential Transactions\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#blind-transactions]\n”, a transaction type that hides the transferred amounts. To hide the identity\nof the participants as well, a RingCT transaction\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#anon-transactions] \nis then directly chained into the initial Confidential Transaction’s outputs,\nultimately hiding all information about both the transacted amounts and\nparticipants to anyone not involved with the transaction. This offers the\nhighest level of transactional privacy possible, one not remotely possible with\ntraditional escrow models such as those we see on the most popular online\nmarketplaces and payment processors.\n\nNotably, this form of anonymous escrow smart-contract is an impressive feat\nconsidering that RingCT transactions are very rigid and not even supposed to be\nable to interact with smart-contracts. You can learn more about the creative\nmethods the Particl team used to make that possible here\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities]\n.\n\nTwo-Party Escrow Contracts; Making Possible a Myriad of Use-Cases\nTwo-party escrow contracts open up a ton of use-cases and advantages unique to\nits model. Some of them are due to its commitment to trustless privacy, the\nabsence of commissions or escrow fees, or the MAD system’s inherent resistance\nto abuse.\n\nWhile all those advantages stand on their own, they particularly shine in the\ncontexts of:\n\nProviding unstoppable, uncensorable eCommerce gateways for otherwise censored\nindividuals or blocked regions.\n\nThere are many cases of individuals running online stores getting censored or\nshut down by their provider — be it a payment processor, hosting provider, or\neCommerce platform operator. The same can be said of people living in specific\nregions of the world that are banned from traditional financial services or\nsimply unbanked.\n\nBecause even settlements on Particl can be achieved purely peer-to-peer, such\nindividuals now have the new-found option of easily opening up a storefront and\nengaging in restriction-less commerce without the possibility for an escrow\nservice to weigh in, intervene on, or run interference in the process.\n\nIn other words, a trustless, private, and truly person-to-person escrow model,\nespecially when supported by an equally open and free marketplace environment\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], creates a global free market environment where\neveryone, regardless of who they are and where they live, gets to do business on\na fair, level playing field.\n\nProtection of intellectual property\n\nIn a powerful, reliable escrow system without third-party involvement, users are\nassured that it is impossible for their marketplace service provider (in this\ncase, Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace]) to spy on them or\ncollect valuable data information.\n\nThis is a reassuring news for sellers, and especially product inventors, as\nsalvaged data from centralized escrow system providers is usually sold (often\ndirectly to competitors) and re-used by the platform operator itself; a practice\nthat goes directly against a seller’s best interest and, at times, frustratingly\nleads to the total destruction of one’s business as we’ve explored in this \nParticl Story [https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nProviding additional means for wholesalers and goods manufacturers to\nsell/dispose of excess stock\n\nWhen wholesalers reach a point of critical excess inventory, they need to get\nrid of excess inventory at a minimal cost. Unfortunately, this makes using\ntraditional marketplace environments problematic due to its many layers of\nthird-party involvement and associated costs.\n\nWith Particl Marketplace, they can do so with no additional sales costs thanks\nto Particl’s marketplace protocol zero-commission approach and the absence of\nmiddlemen involved. This is a scenario where both the wholesaler and the\nconsumer get more out of their assets, ultimately reducing the total volume of\nwaste/discarded products.\n\nMore direct, more liquid, and more secure B2B and B2C trades.\n\nThis is made possible by Particl Marketplace’s zero fees and zero data\ncollection approach, which is unmatched in any other system (even in\ncustom-built systems, the central entity running this system, such as a central\nserver or database, can always collect some amount of data.)\n\nAvoiding scams when making in-person or high-value transactions\n\nParticl Marketplace and its two-party escrow system can be used to secure\nin-person transactions when an added layer of security is wanted or required,\nsuch as when two strangers physically meet to trade together.\n\nThe two-party escrow system, in this case, acts as a near-free trade assurance\nservice and eliminates the need for trust and any incentive of foul play. This\nsimple MAD escrow protection brings significant plus-value to any in-person\ntrade between strangers, whether for small transactions such as on Facebook\nMarketplace trades or luxury goods like, for example, the sale of a piece of art\nor an expensive watch.\n\nAs an additional protection layer when trading with trusted business partners\n\nWhen two people often trade with each other directly, they may end up building\ntrust and not require the full range of costly escrow services offered by\neCommerce platforms. Particl’s escrow system can then function as a near-free\nlayer of additional protection so that both parties don't have to trade naked,\nprotecting each of them against \"long cons\" or sudden shifts in the other\nparty's behavior. \n\nIt allows a buyer and a seller to reap nearly all the benefits of removing\ntraditional marketplace environments and associated fees from their business\nrelationship while keeping a level of trade assurance to protect both parties\nagainst unforeseen risks. Should the worst happen, both parties are incentivized\nto find a solution acceptable to all.\n\nTo sell products that are heavily restricted or even banned by regulated\nentities, such as medicine.\n\nThis possibility opens the door to a whole world of cross-border arbitrage, as\nheavily regulated products often vary wildly in price from one market to\nanother. It can also empower individuals to access products that are removed\nfrom circulation or difficult to acquire in their region, such as is often the\ncase of medicinal products or even literature (i.e., books banned due to a\nspecific political climate in the region).\n\n> N.B.: All of the above-mentioned use-cases are, of course, just a few examples\nof  what a private, decentralized, and two-party escrow makes possible. We hear\nof buyers and sellers with different reasons and benefits that they draw from\nthis system every week, and we’re sure we will continue to hear of new ones as\nadoption of this novel system grows!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Uncompromising Alternative to Traditional Market Settlements\nA two-party escrow system is unusual and involves a level of commitment that\nsellers and buyers are not often accustomed to. However, as we've just seen, it\nalso comes with powerful upsides that facilitate commerce trades within a wide\nrange of use-cases — the highest of which, in our view, is making possible a\nworldwide, absolutely uncompromisingly open, free, private, and unrestricted\nworld market of goods and services.\n\nSuch a protocol is already a strong complement to traditional escrow models.\nBeyond that, we believe it is bound to hold as a soaring, paradigm-shifting\nalternative in a world where centralized payment processors and financial\nservice providers are becoming more restrictive by the day. And we’re here for\nit.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>Particl is, first and foremost, an ecosystem of privacy-first, decentralized applications.

That is why contract security and enforcement are essential when trading goods and services in any marketplace.</p><p><br>One common solution eCommerce platforms and payment processors use is a mutually-trusted third party — in other words, an escrow agent or “issue resolution center”. In the context of a decentralized marketplace, this incurs a critical problem: the introduction of a centralized moderating entity. It also attracts its own privacy issues as well as some economic drawbacks. Let’s explore what this means for Particl Marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"common-issues-with-traditional-escrow-models\">Common Issues With Traditional Escrow Models</h2><p>With traditional escrow, a third-party (the escrow agent) holds onto an asset and releases it when the transaction is completed (i.e., the purchased item is delivered). That role is generally assumed by the marketplace or exchange itself (i.e., Amazon, Openbazaar), a payment processor (i.e., Paypal, Visa), or third-party escrow services (i.e., a bank or a financial institution). This allows potential disputes or issues to be safely settled, but it also carries important issues.</p><p>Firstly, running escrow or issue resolution services incurs a heavy cost reflected in the platform's fees. When added to every link of a supply chain, this fee ends up substantially impacting retail prices and making up a large portion of the final price of nearly all products we buy daily.</p><p>Additionally, when an issue arises, it is usually settled according to a very rigid set of policies rather than being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. This allows for more issues to be resolved quickly and efficiently but can also lead to biased resolutions that benefit the operator's own bottom line. In turn, scammers have perfected the art of defeating these hard-set policies to steal money, products, or both, from rule-abiding users and sellers. Online merchants are well aware of this problem and hedge their exposure to this risk through their prices, an unfortunate reality that the customer is ultimately led to bear the costs.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, these solutions offer no privacy at all to their users and incur intrusive data requirements due to the operator needing to be aware of every detail related to a single transaction to fulfill its role. This gives them complete oversight and insight over all the sensitive and, at times, confidential, personal, professional, financial, and commercial data collected from the platform's users — which they, in turn, can use in accordance with their interests, often to the<a href=\"https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/\"> detriment of the individuals and businesses using the platform</a>.</p><h1 id=\"particl-s-two-party-online-escrow-solution\">Particl’s Two-Party Online Escrow Solution</h1><p>Particl adopts a radically different escrow model which addresses the issues mentioned above. Often dubbed a “two-party escrow\", or \"MAD escrow\", it involves only two parties; the buyer and the seller, with no one else in between.</p><p>Instead of requiring a third party to hold the payment on behalf of two transacting parties, both participants are required to provide collateral by making an equal security deposit into a smart-contract. This security deposit can be adjusted from 0 to 100% of the total value of the item or service sold and is <strong>automatically refunded, in its entirety, once both parties mark the transaction as completed</strong>. Notably, this form of decentralized escrow is infinitely scalable, as there are no operating costs associated with running these types of cryptographically-enforced contracts and no escrow agents required for it to function.</p><p>If a dispute or issue arises, both parties need to mutually agree on a satisfying resolution for the transaction to be marked as complete. Because the two parties have a security deposit locked into the escrow smart-contract, they are naturally forced to collaborate and reach a reasonable resolution for both. <strong>This method of escrow allows the Particl marketplace to preserve the privacy of everyone involved in every instance.</strong></p><p>Another important but often overlooked advantage of two-party escrows involves sellers and cash flow. Although 2-of-2 escrow demands a security deposit, which may, on first thought, appear as a cash flow-inhibiting process, it is completely shielded from<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/paypal-stole-users-money-after-freezing-seizing-funds-lawsuit-alleges/\"> assets being frozen by entities like Amazon or Paypal</a> in the event of a dispute or perceived terms of use violations.

Although the\ntermination itself seems questionable, the legal fight it engendered reveals\ntroubling revelations on a much broader scope.\n\nAccording to Lawson’s suit\n[https://docs.reclaimthenet.org/Brennan-Lawson-Lawsuit.pdf], Facebook introduced\nin late 2018 a protocol that allowed members of its team — “a group of\napproximately 100 employees responsible for (...) high visibility inquiries from\nmembers of the media and governments” — to access all data from the Facebook\nMessenger application even if the user entirely deleted the data.\n\nThis practice, while hardly surprising, is in stark contrast to earlier claims\nby Facebook about their handling of reportedly “deleted” and unarchived data and\nradically undermines all Facebook users’ alleged ability to control the privacy\nof their personal information. With no safeguards regarding age restrictions,\nanyone’s Messenger history can be accessed with the back-end protocol — even\nthat of children.\n\nThis protocol, if confirmed, would certainly violate Facebook's own privacy\npolicies, but also online privacy rules of the European union — and although a \n2012 FTC ruling on consumer privacy\n[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2012/03/ftc-issues-final-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy] \nand the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act\n[https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa] \nheld Meta and other companies to a higher level of transparency with regards to\nthe data they did collect, it seems not all regulations are created equal.\n\nAn important reason behind this intrusive protocol was, allegedly, to “keep\nFacebook in the good graces of the American government”. This complete lack of\ntransparency, along with recent reports of ex-CIA hires to Meta’s online\nsecurity operations and various content moderation teams, raises much concern.\n\nThe Open-Source Imperative Against Invasive Government\nFor people paying attention to the state of privacy and world surveillance in\nthe past few decades, none of this is surprising. It is instead highly\nvindicating. Thankfully, the tools exist to allow us to change the world for the\nbetter — and optimistic individuals may say it’s only a matter of time.\n\nOpen-source software, above all, imposes itself as an inevitable alternative to\nan otherwise grim outlook for online privacy. Although still lacking in\ndevelopment in the world of social media compared to their closed-source\ncounterparts, an open-source approach guarantees transparency in the most\nuncompromising way, and, in turn, empowers us with significantly more privacy\nfor our data. And even though the ethics of open-source developers, contrary to\nwhat we see today at Meta and other popular platforms, often perfectly align\nwith the goal to undermine those privacy abuses, there is not even a need for\ntrusting any policy in the face of total transparency and auditability!\n\nThe good news is, although the path to counter-balance the widespread spying\nand\nmonetization\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/] of our\npersonal data is uphill, it is also in numerous good and devoted hands. \n\nThe open-source revolution we so deeply need can only come about via the true\n\"liberation\" of our online services.

On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1.

This should\n   prevent a common error where a market with an image is promoted but, due to\n   insufficient utxos available, the market itself is promoted, but the image is\n   sent and the GUI shows that an error occurred (despite the actual market\n   being  promoted but without an associated image).\n * The smsg keys for a market are now only removed from particl-core after the\n   market is successfully removed from particl-marketplace database (should\n   prevent an error with the removal of the market from the database from\n   stopping the market from receiving new listing items).\n * The Cart page > Shipping form now defaults the 'Save shipping profile'\n   checkbox to true if there are no addresses previously saved.\n * Adds the 'Add to cart' functionality for the listing item details modal that\n   is launched from the Chat Messages > Conversations tab (for Listing Item type\n   chats).\n * Removes the marketplace service's monitor functionality for now.\n\nWallet Module\n * Transaction table entries now display the confirmation count after the\n   transaction description rather than before it: this both keeps the layout\n   consistent and prevents the transaction amount from being cutoff\n   (half-hidden) when the application window is at its smallest dimensions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs stated, because of the scope of the changes introduced by this release,\nnotably related to major dependencies updates, we highly encourage the community\nto test it out extensively to ensure it runs smoothly on all platforms and\nenvironments.
