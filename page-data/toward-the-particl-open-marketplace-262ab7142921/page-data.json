Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for the biggest event of the year in\ncrypto: the NYC Blockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events]. There, \nthey will finally reveal the Open Marketplace on the real Particl network, the\nmainnet, for the first time ever!\n\nAnd that Open Marketplace is not “just another marketplace”, it is a world\nfirst: a decentralized marketplace, fully autonomous and private, for a new\ncustomer and seller experience\n\nIf you don’t know about it, let us present it to you!\n\nIn this blog post, we will tell you about:\n\n * The Particl Open Marketplace\n * The NYC Blockchain Week\n * The road to the marketplace & how we got there\n * The current state of development, and more\n\nWhat’s the Particl Open Marketplace?\nSimply put, the Open Marketplace is an entirely decentralized marketplace where\nyou can buy and sell products and services to anyone else in the world, in full\nprivacy. Think Alibaba or eBay, but on the blockchain and without a company\nbeing in control of the platform. This means there is no risk of a third party\nusing its position of power to spy on you and impose its arbitrary rules and\nfees.\n\nThe marketplace is fully autonomous, meaning that it doesn’t require any\nthird-party or intermediary to function. It instead restores the balance of\npower back to the people by using a combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer\ntechnologies. The absence of intermediaries alone is enough to bring the cost of\nselling on the platform to a near-zero level.\n\nThis means both vendors and buyers end up with more money in their pockets.\nBecause vendors make more profit per sale, they can reduce their prices to\nincrease their volume and beat the competition. This, in turn, means customers\ncan potentially gain access to cheaper products!\n\nThe Particl Open Marketplace also utilizes a combination of various security\nmeasures and privacy protocols to ensure that none of your data can be accessed\nby anyone. It is a “private by default” marketplace, meaning that you don’t need\nto take any extra step in order to protect your data — it’s just the way Particl\nis.\n\nParticl at the NYC Blockchain Week\nThe NYC Blockchain Week is a series of many crypto events happening within the\nsame timeframe in New York. It attracts the biggest names in the industry,\nshowcases the best blockchain projects, and unites the many different crypto\ncommunities together for one exciting week. In a way, the NYC Blockchain Week is\nto crypto what the World Cup is to football.\n\nParticl in NYC\nParticl is, of course, going to be a part of this event. In fact, you’ll be able\nto come to meet us, right at our booth, at either Magical Crypto Conference or \nConsensus. That’s right! We’ll be having a booth at the two best conferences NYC\nBlockchain Week 2019 has to offer and we’ll be demonstrating the Particl Open\nMarketplace, in exclusivity, on mainnet!\n\nMagical Crypto Conference (MCC)—11th & 12th of May\nThe Magical Crypto Conference [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/] is a\npure crypto-community conference. It is organized and hosted by the well known\n“Magical Crypto Friends”, a group of 4 influencers in the crypto space: Charlie\nLee (Litecoin), Samson Mow (Blockstream CSO), Ricardo Spagni (Monero), and\n“WhalePanda”\n\nThis is the perfect place to meet potential Open Marketplace users and is the\nreason why we are so excited to be having a booth at this event. In fact, as MCC\nis more of a pure crypto community conference, it attracts some of the crypto\npioneers and people that are already deeply interested by the true vision of\ncryptocurrencies, privacy, decentralization, and personal freedom. A simple look\nat the speaker list [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#speakers] should\ngive you a good idea of the type of people that will attend the event.\n\nConsensus by Coindesk—13th to the 15th of May\nStarted by Coindesk in 2015, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] is one of the first crypto\nconference ever and the most prestigious. It has become the biggest\ncryptocurrency event in the world and is a place where people mean business.\n\nThis will be the ideal place to meet various people from different areas of\nexpertise — media, marketing, law, vendors, suppliers, influencers, and, of\ncourse, crypto fans. Such a varied crowd of people is sure to have a lot of\ndifferent feedback about the Open Marketplace, and we are really excited to see\nthe reaction of these people when faced with a modern blockchain product, on\nmainnet.\n\nHaving a good chunk of the team at Consensus will also be ideal to meet people,\ncraft new relationships, and grow the amount of interest for the Particl\necosystem.\n\nMeet the Team\nThe Particl team is going to be 10 member/representative strong going into these\nconferences.\n\n * Juha (Ludx) — Lead Open Marketplace Developer\n * Gerlof van Ek (Crz) — Lead Designer & Branding, UI/UX, Developer\n * Paul Schmitzer (Litebit) — Project Marketing & Strategy\n * Imran (Imyb) — Commercial & Partner Strategy\n * Cryptoguard — Communications & Strategy\n * Gloria (Katelady) — Communications & Strategy\n * Joe Fisher — eCommerce Strategy (Particl Advisor)\n * Lina Seiche — Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist\n * Desi-Rae Campbell (Cryptoramble) — Education & Awareness\n * Joskye — Education & Awareness\n\nCome to our booth at either MCC or Consensus and have a chat with us. We’ll be\ngiving out PART paper wallets, shirts/hoodies, webcam covers, stickers, pins,\nand, most importantly, you’ll be able to test the Particl Open Marketplace live\non mainnet for the first time ever!\n\nIn the meantime, our other developers are hard at work, as per usual, preparing\nthe final build of the Open Marketplace so that it can be publicly released on\nmainnet.\n\nThe Open Marketplace — 2 Great Years of Development\nThe Open Marketplace is quite something to see. It is a complex combination of\npeer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy\nprotocols. It’s also never been attempted before, most of the development toward\nthe marketplace being true pioneering work. It supports a decentralized and\nprivate cryptocurrency, an entirely decentralized escrow mechanism,\ndecentralized file hosting, metadata leak prevention, and etc.\n\nTo see all of the components and features of the Open Marketplace, read our\nPrivacy in eCommerce blog post by following this link: \nhttps://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155\n\nIt has been under heavy and constant development for nearly two years. Almost\nexactly one year ago, Particl released its first proof-of-concept on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, although with a much more basic version of what it has now become. At the\ntime, a simple buy and sell flow was available, without moderation tools,\nwithout proposals, and without a user interface that’s as stable and\nuser-friendly as it is today.\n\nAll this time, throughout the cold crypto winter, the Particl team has been \nhard\nat work [https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9] to\ndeliver its long-anticipated Open Marketplace on mainnet. This much is evidenced\nnot only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on Github\n[http://github.com/particl] but by the very noticeable progress being made on\nthe Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl\nproject has found itself being ranked high in almost all development-related\nrankings of blockchain projects\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAnd here we are, in New York City, presenting the Particl Open Marketplace live\non the main network for the first time ever!\n\nWhat’s next?\nAfter 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is\nnearly over ?\n\nStarting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain,\nParticl created a first:\n\n→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is\nthought of with maximum privacy and security in mind. Everything on Particl is\nprivate, from its untraceable currency to its marketplace, without forgetting\nits proposal, escrow, messaging, file hosting systems, and more.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning, a lot will come after the release of the Open\nMarketplace on mainnet:\n\n * Advanced Open Marketplace features: secure messaging, privacy transactions,\n   inventory management, in-client package tracking, review system, fiat price\n   pegging, and etc.\n * “Marketplace Bubbles” : your own private market on the particl network!\n * CT Bulletproofs, while still being tested on the test network, will improve\n   drastically the size of privacy transactions for any trades of the network.\n   Don’t forget that Particl uses RingCT technology (on testnet), a first on the\n   Bitcoin codebase!\n * Particl Lightning Network (our first testnet transaction just happened a few\n   days ago\n   [https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n   ) and Atomic Swap, so that anyone can change its Bitcoins, Litecoins,\n   Moneros, and more on the marketplace to buy anything in the blink of an eye!\n * Developer SDK so that anyone can easily build their own decentralized\n   applications on the Particl network.\n\nWe are excited to show what true privacy in eCommerce looks like this week in\nNew York, both at MCC and Consensus conference. Although we may be extremely\nbusy during that time, we will not forget to report everything that happens here\nso that you can live these events with us. If you are there, do not hesitate to\npass at our booth to test the marketplace and get some Particl or Bitcoin\nbranded goodies.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-gZG9HtTiXDgtDcLDGYpbgQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

It is a complex combination of peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy protocols.

This much is evidenced not only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on <a href=\"http://github.com/particl\">Github</a> but by the very noticeable progress being made on the Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl project has found itself being <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9\"><strong>ranked high in almost all development-related rankings of blockchain projects</strong></a>.</p><p>And here we are, in New York City, presenting the <strong>Particl Open Marketplace live on the main network for the first time ever</strong>!</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-rxsJBXQxnvGWIqJb9-_k-A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>After 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is nearly over ?</p><p>Starting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain, Particl created a first:</p><p>→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is thought of with maximum privacy and security in mind.

Whereas last year was focused on building the base\nlayer for the Open Marketplace, this year has been all about refining it and\nstarting to add new features on top of it. That doesn’t mean, however, that the\nonly milestones reached this year were about the marketplace! Here’s a complete\nlist of all the accomplishments and deliverables Particl had so far this year:\n\nParticl Copay 5.4.1 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44] (Jan 17th): A\nnew version of Particl Copay was released on the 17th of January and marked a\nrenewed active development for Particl’s mobile application.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the\nnetwork as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the\nfunctioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing\nmessages around the network and make the governance system work. The hardfork\nwent through without any issue and the network is now ready for the mainnet\nrelease of the marketplace.\n\nHardfork Successful [https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83]\n?

While we initially intended to move entirely on Discord and put\nTelegram in read-only mode, our travels around the world have made it clear we\ncouldn’t do that as some countries exclusively use Telegram. Nevertheless, the\nteam has been mostly moved over there and our Discord server will be the main\nplatform we’ll focus on moving forward even though we will keep our Telegram\nchannel open.\n\nParticl is Officially Moving to Discord\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nThe Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever\nsince\nwe abandoned Slack more than a year…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\n\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d] \n(March 8th): On the 8th March, Particl reached a big milestone by releasing its\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on testnet.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big\nconference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and\nintroducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community.\nNot only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also\nproved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major\nconferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto\nConference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace\nwould be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect\nour commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first\nmainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions\nenabled by default.\n\nAdditionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the\nBitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after\nBitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the\nrelease of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of\ntime the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the\nescrow mechanism.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
