All of this combined sets\nBasicSwap apart as a DEX with uncompromising ease of use, security and\ndecentralization, and creates an environment that is totally free of any central\npoint of failure. Best of all: there are absolutely no trading fees!\n\nWe’ve already published an extensive blog post explaining everything you need\nto\nknow about BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]. So if you\nwant more information on this upcoming breakthrough DEX, make sure to give it a\nread!\n\nAbout BasicSwap’s User Interface\nAs you may already be aware, the BasicSwap back-end protocol (\"swap engine\") has\nbeen operational as an early beta software for a while, allowing mainnet swaps\nto take place between a range of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nParticl and even Monero.\n\nHowever, what it lacked, up until today, was a user-friendly and easy-to-use\ninterface to facilitate the act of trading on the platform. As we’ve often seen\nwithin the blockchain industry, the user experience is of the utmost importance.\n\nThat’s why we’ve opted to wait until BasicSwap’s user-friendly GUI was ready\nbefore publicly releasing the beta. And now that this is done, we enter a new\nphase for BasicSwap!\n\nThe Final Closed Beta Testing Round Begins Today\nWith the first version of the BasicSwap GUI now completed (v0.1), we have now\nbegun the final closed beta testing round before the public launch of the open\nbeta.\n\nDuring this final round, we’ll thoroughly test the user interface across a wide\nrange of environments and scenarios as well as the DEX protocol itself. This\nwill ensure the smoothest and most hassle-free open beta launch (public)\npossible.\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap’s Status?\nBasicSwap is a beta product and still under development. The release of the open\nbeta is a major milestone in its development but it is by no means a completed\nproduct.\n\nAs such, there may be missing features, quirks in the user experience, and areas\nof improvement. This is normal at this stage, and that’s precisely where we need\nyou!\n\nIf, during the upcoming open beta, you encounter any issue, bug, or discover\nareas of improvements, be sure to let us know by logging it on the DEX’s issue\npage [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/issues].

That’s because\nit is highly dependent on how the final closed beta testing round goes.\n\nHowever, we don’t expect that testing period to last for a long time. We’ll be\nsure to communicate clearly the launch date a few days before.\n\nHow Can I Support the Upcoming Open Beta Launch?\nAs the open beta launch approaches rapidly, there are a few things you can\nalready do to pre-emptively help out.\n\nFirst and foremost, BasicSwap uses an order book system to match traders\ntogether rather than a single liquidity pool. That means its user experience\ndepends in major part on the liquidity available on the books.\n\nAs such, putting liquidity on BasicSwap when it releases not only grants you\naccess to a healthier trading environment on which you can trade, but it also\nhelps others match their trades, making BasicSwap a more viable solution for all\nand, in turn, bringing more liquidity as a result.\n\nSimilarly to putting liquidity on the books, every attempt at getting the word\nout also helps immensely. Whether that be to friends, in your online\ncommunities, on Reddit or crypto Twitter, any place is a good place to let\nothers, who may benefit from what BasicSwap has to offer, know about it.\n\nA DEX thrives the bigger its user base is; we all win by bringing more people to\nBasicSwap and providing liquidity!\n\nBasicSwap Website About to Go Live\nTo support the public launch of BasicSwap’s beta and help others better\nunderstand how the platform benefits them, we will launch a new website entirely\ndedicated to BasicSwap. This will be an incredibly useful tool that will make it\neasier to share with others what vital benefits they can get for using a\nproperly decentralized and privacy-focused trading platform.\n\nThe launch of the BasicSwap website is planned for before the launch of the open\nbeta.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA better, more private, and fair-to-all trading environment looms and there’s no\nturning back!\n\nAs always, we will keep you posted about it through our weekly development\nprogress reports available on Particl News.

with the creation of the \"first altcoin\", Litecoin, people have been\npondering and developing ways to swap their favorite digital assets without\nrelying on third-parties — the goal being an efficient, simple and private way\nto swap Bitcoin for Litecoin, or Monero, or any other cryptocurrency, that holds\nthe same values as a traditional P2P cryptocurrency transaction. The immediate\nproblem is that these cryptocurrencies generally reside on separate blockchains,\nwhich do not offer a lot of interoperability.\n\nDevelopers and tech entrepreneurs of all kinds have spotted this need in the\nmarket and went to work trying to bring to life a series of decentralized\ntrading exchanges — often abbreviated as \"DEX\".  This led to an increase in the\nnumber of DEXs and decentralized trading protocols which, in truth, really have\nlarge degrees of variation between them in terms of decentralization or even\nstraight up usability.\n\nOne thing that can be observed is that, even today with dozens upon dozens of\nDEXs, a substantial quantity of them focus exclusively on intra-chain swaps,\nmeaning swapping different assets belonging to the same chain together. Those\nare unfortunately very restricted in their swapping abilities, and do not fix\nthe underlying issues regarding important but perhaps more difficult to\nintegrate blockchains like Monero.\n\nCrossing the Chain Barrier\nTo many users, the details of how such cross-chain trades are accomplished under\nthe hood is not very much on their mind — and the distinction may even seem\nfutile. The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to\nbe able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the\nBinance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability\noffered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those\nusers’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional\nprivacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about\ndecentralization and privacy.\n\nThere is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many\nbold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are\nput forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is\ngenerally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty\nboth in terms of decentralization and of security.\n\nA common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or\n\"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed\nbe decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a wrapped asset on\nthe very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A wrapped asset is a token\non a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be\nmirroring.\n\nThe original asset is held, in custody, by a third-party which then issues a\ntoken worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian\nto its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it\nin exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your\ncoins”.\n\nUnfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (which has happened\nin the past\n[https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/]) there is\nabsolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly reverse\nor freeze your transactions\n[https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/] \nthemselves, or lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets\n[https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/]\n. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything\ndecentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnother common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with\nimportant challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains,\nor with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.\n\nThe Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs\nAtomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been first proposed\nin\n2013\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784]\n. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap\ncryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and\ncondition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo\none's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to\ntheir original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing\natomic swaps.\n\nBut even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to\nachieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely\ndifferent chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric\ncoins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private\nblockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly and decentralized\nalternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both,\nor deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic\nGUI.\n\nAtomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire\ntrue cross-chain operability on a bona fide exchange, and without giving in an\ninch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network,\nor layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is\nprecisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely\navailable between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.\n\nThat’s in major part what motivated us to build BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] — a \ncross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX. When you trade, say,\nBitcoin to Monero on the BasicSwap orderbook, no extensive node configuration is\nneeded, and absolutely no wrapping of assets takes place. We instead made true\ncross-chain swaps possible by combining two groundbreaking protocols; atomic\nswaps, and Particl’s own SMSG mixnet network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]SMSG: A layer\n2 Solution for Cross-Chain Interoperability\nBitcoin advocates often mention the role of cross-chain operability will be\nfilled by the Lightning Network.

The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to be able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the Binance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability offered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those users’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional privacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about decentralization and privacy.</p><p>There is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many bold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are put forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is generally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty both in terms of decentralization and of security.</p><p>A common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or \"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed be decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a <strong>wrapped asset</strong> on the very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A <strong>wrapped asset</strong> is a token on a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be mirroring.</p><p>The original asset is held, <strong>in custody</strong>, by a third-party which then issues a token worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian to its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it in exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your coins”.</p><p>Unfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (<a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/\">which has happened in the past</a>) there is absolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly<a href=\"https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/\"> reverse or freeze your transactions</a> themselves, or<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/\"> lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets</a>. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything decentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Another common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with important challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains, or with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.</p><h2 id=\"the-challenges-of-atomic-swaps-and-dexs\">The Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs</h2><p>Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784\">first proposed in 2013</a>. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap cryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and condition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo one's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to their original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing atomic swaps.</p><p>But even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to achieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely different chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric coins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private blockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly <em>and</em> decentralized alternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both, or deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic GUI.</p><p>Atomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire true cross-chain operability on a <em>bona fide</em> exchange, and without giving in an inch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network, or layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is precisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely available between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.</p><p>That’s in major part what motivated us to build <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap</a> — a <strong>cross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX</strong>.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
