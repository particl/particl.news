Indeed, we can now go as far as saying that only\nthree things are guaranteed in life: taxation, death, and your personal\ninformation leaking to undesirable parties.\n\n“But I have nothing to hide, so why should I care?” one might say. Well, aside\nfrom having your identity stolen or your credit card filled up with fraudulent\npurchases, there’s one ugly fact that is barely understood by anyone: the risk\nof having your own thoughts being used against you. We know, this sounds...weird\nand vague, but the 2016 American presidential election is, as we’ll see, a\nfantastic example of this often-overlooked phenomenon associated with data\nmining.\n\nThe lessons we can learn from the Cambridge Analytica \"scandal\"\nNovember 2016 saw the election of a highly polarizing figure to the American\npresidency: Donald J. Trump. Whether one’s opinion on the man is negative or\npositive, there is a good chance that it is not neutral.\n\nIn 2016, Trump’s presidential campaign contracted Cambridge Analytica\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica], a big data firm that\nspecialized in analyzing data and selling the conclusions of their research to\ninterested parties, to help craft them narratives and political strategies.\nCambridge Analytica, on their “about” web page, touted an impressive 5000 data\npoints per person, targeting 220 million Americans\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about]\n, and used that data to create personality models for those people. That\ninformation, if you could afford it, was highly valuable to the Trump campaign’s\nambitions – and with the help of Cambridge Analytica, they gathered as much\ninformation on American voters as they possibly could. What do they like, or\nfear? What are the biggest issues? What triggers in them the most emotion? Who\ndo they talk to? Where do they hang out? What is the best way to catch their\nattention? The list was extensive\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html]\n.\n\nAs it turned out, even when people disliked Trump, they talked about him a lot,\nand often on social media. This created intense debates of ideas, creating the\nconditions for all the data Cambridge Analytica needed to advise the Trump\ncampaign on how to best move forward. Simply talking about him on social media\nis very likely to have contributed to his unexpected 306-to-232 victory.\n\nIt’s clear in hindsight that our discourse allowed Cambridge to craft very apt\npolitical narratives in order to appeal to a large part of the population –\noften alienated from common politicians - and provided all the information\nrequired to draft an election strategy. Ironically, the polemic around Trump –\nhow controversial he was as a political figure – directly contributed to his\nvictory. In the end, for slightly more than half of American voters, their data\nwas in effect used against them.\n\nAn institutional problem\nBut here’s the real cherry on top: every single political party, on either side\nof the aisle, every corporation, think tank, research firm, every special\ninterest group - they are all guilty of the exact same thing the Trump campaign\ndid with Cambridge Analytica. They all do it, almost without exception – the\nstakes are too high not to, and the bottom lines too attractive.\n\nAnd so, whenever you log online and discuss with others, do research, scroll up\nor down and spend X amount of seconds on this or that social media post, you\ngenerate data that not only could leak and expose you to malicious actors, but\nalso be used to profile and track you, and often against your own interests.\n\nIf you’re an online vendor, for example, then it’s your sales volume and page\ntraffic that will be collected sometimes by competitors, other times by the\neCommerce platform you’re using. And this valuable data can then be used to put\nyou out of business.\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nIt happened, it still happens, and it’ll keep happening. In fact, the problem of\nyour data being used against you go far beyond politics and can reach every\nsingle aspect of your life. It probably already did and you may not even be\naware of; how could you in the first place?\n\nSo how do we stop this? How do we protect our digital sovereignty and opt out of\nthis toxic dynamic?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems impossible if you use traditional web technologies, or\nwhat is increasingly being referred to as “web2”. With cookies, data sharing\npolicies, and monetization, there’s little to no way to escape from this. It’s\nfor “advertisement purposes”, they say. But we all certainly know better!\n\nFor example, what if you want to buy something online? Then you have to go on a\nwebsite that uses various plugins and third-party services. The most obvious\nbeing a payment processor and/or bank, a domain host, a website/server host, a\nweb platform (i.e., Wordpress and its plugins), an e-commerce solution (Amazon,\neBay, Shopify), etc. All of these third-parties collect their own set of data,\naccording to what they want to know about you (and how much they plan on\nmonetize your information), and then, they share it to even more partners that,\nin turn, monetize your data and probably share it with their own partners as\nwell. A simple purchase on Amazon spreads your personal information in all\ndirections with absolutely no control or consent on your end (and as we’ve seen, \nagreeing to pop up privacy and cookie policies does a poor job at slowing this\ndata pandemic down\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]]).\n\nGiven time, every problem finds its solution\nThis state of affairs was a big motivation behind our development of the \nParticl\nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] - a decentralized, peer-to-peer\nmarketplace with no middleman and no data collection whatsoever. All\ntransactions are made person-to-person with no unauthorized party having access\nto any single piece of information. Our privacy coin is also a major aspect of\nwhy it works; all trades are inherently private and anonymous, protecting both\nbuyers and sellers from having their data harvested by scrapers and unscrupulous\nintermediaries. Calling it the world’s safest and most private way to buy and\nsell anything online is no exaggeration because if no data is generated in the\nfirst place, then it can’t be collected. And that’s precisely how we roll!\n\nWith the state of the internet today, it is high time we get back to being\nskeptical and careful about who we share our data with; it’s never been as much\nof a problem as it is now and one would be ill-advised to think this will get\nbetter on its own, without us taking the appropriate steps required to protect\nourselves. Why would “they” want to stop the gravy train\n[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gravy-train]?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours. Do you want to take the risk of sharing your\npersonal information with thousands of entities, with a myriad of hidden\nintentions? Would you take the chance of that information potentially being used\nagainst you, however that might happen? Or, would you rather be safe than sorry?\n\nIf you’re thinking of taking precautions, then the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] is just the thing for you!

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
