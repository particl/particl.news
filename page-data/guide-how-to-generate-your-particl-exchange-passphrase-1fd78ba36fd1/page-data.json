Donate to a Good Cause. (community initiative #1)\n 2. Public Key Generation. (offline wallet generator)\n 3. Accept Terms.\n 4. I’m Ready. (submit)\n\n> To help everyone work through these steps we’ve created 2 guides; a video\nwalk-thru of the offline wallet generator and a written guide below.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo Tutorial link: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSjLsCkabEk&feature=youtu.be\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSjLsCkabEk&feature=youtu.be]\n\nGetting Started:\n * Login to your account on the Particl Token Exchange site: https://particl.io\n\n * Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to: \n   https://particl.github.io/genesis-wallet-generator/bip39-standalone.html\n * You can choose to run this Genesis Wallet Generation procedure either on\n\n 1. Local Computer or\n 2. Offline (via livecd/airgapped computer)\n\nLocal Computer\n * In your browser, select File → Save As… and save this page on your local\n   computer.\n * Double-click that file to open it in a browser\n\nOffline (LIVECD/AIRGAPPED) — Recommended!\n * In your browser, select File → Save As… and save this page on a USB stick.\n * Boot your preferred LIVECD / AIRGAPPED setup with Networking DISABLED\n * Insert USB and double-click the downloaded file to open it in a browser\n\n> NOTE: If you are using Offline method during Steps 3 and 4 below copy the\ninformation into a new text file on the USB Stick. You can then swap the USB\nStick back to your computer running Particl Dashboard and copy + paste the\nrelevant information into the Particl Dashboard.\nNow you’re in the Particl — Offline Genesis Wallet Generator Tool and ready for\nthe next steps!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Generate Wallet Recovery Phrase\n * Click on the GENERATE button to generate your mnemonic recovery phrase OR you\n   can alternatively enter an existing mnemonic recovery phrase that you have\n   already generated. More words will provide greater security\n\n> Typing your own words will probably not work how you expect, since the words\nrequire a particular structure (the last word is a checksum).\nThis recovery phrase is the key to your wallet, similar to the key to your home\nor car. Be sure to write these down, copy it and store them somewhere safe. \nWithout it, you will not be able to access your wallet. Do not share these with\nanyone.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Securing Your Wallet\n * This step is optional but recommended. If you enter a passphrase here be sure\n   to write it down, copy it and store it somewhere safe. Without it, you will\n   not be able to access your wallet. Do not share these with anyone.\n * If you setup a passphrase here you will require both “RECOVERY PHRASE” from\n   Step 1 AND “PASSPHRASE” from Step 2 to access your wallet at launch.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Your Public Key\n * Copy this text and go back to the open tab within your Particl Dashboard.\n * Paste this text into YOUR PUBLIC KEY field.\n\n> You do not need to store this information once you have entered it into the\nParticl Portal\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Your Address\n * Navigate back to the tab with the Particl — Offline Genesis Wallet Generator\n   open\n * Copy this text and return to the Particl Portal\n * Paste this text into FIRST ADDRESS field\n\n> You do not need to store this information once you have entered it into the\nParticl Portal\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlmost Done\nYou’re now a proud owner of:\n\n * a brand new Particl Wallet ready to receive your Particl tokens\n * a Public Key that will be used to send your Particl tokens to\n * a Recovery Phrase so that you can access your new Wallet (once the main net\n   is live) and in the future in case you need to restore access to your Wallet\n * and ideally a Passphrase to secure your Recovery Phrase\n\n> If you forgot something, now is a good time to go back and save all the\nimportant information. If you think you made a mistake somewhere, don’t\nworry — you can start over as many times as you want.\nPlease remember to safely write down or print:\n * the Recovery Phrase\n * the optional Passphrase\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComplete the final step\nBe sure to complete the remaining Section #3 and Section #4 in the portal. \nPlease take the time to read and understand the Terms and double-check all your\ninformation before clicking the “SUBMIT” button.\n\n> In case you need some help, our Particl Team and Community will be glad to help!\nCome and join us on Reddit [https://reddit.com/r/particl], Slack\n[https://particl.slack.com/] (get invite here [http://slack.particl.io/]) or \nRiot [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org].","html":"<h3 id=\"we-ve-updated-the-exchange-portal-on-particl-io-since-you-last-logged-in-\">We’ve updated the exchange portal on particl.io since you last logged in.</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Guide--How-to-Generate-your-Particl-Wallet/0-VGrKdEVXQBWyh6MH.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>In anticipation of Mainnet launch we need to prepare your account, each contributor will be greeted with a page containing 4 sections:</p><ol><li>Donate to a Good Cause.
