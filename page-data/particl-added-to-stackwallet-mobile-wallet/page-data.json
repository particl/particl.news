This will essentially enable offers to remain available\nindefinitely, or until the trader removes them from the books.\n\nMoreover, the script can access external APIs to acquire the market prices of\nvarious cryptocurrencies, and relist offers at a specified percentage above or\nbelow the current market price.\n\nAt this time, the script is not ready for production or public testing, however,\nthe delivery of the script is an important first step in providing helpful\nmarket making tools to BasicSwap, a necessary prerequisite for the DEX in order\nto achieve a sufficient level of liquidity.\n\nAs we are continuing to evaluate the script's core features, as well as add\nsupplementary functionality and test it, we will keep you informed of its\nprogress in the next weekly updates.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe have seen steady progress in regards to updating the user interface with\nseveral of its intended improvements. \n\nThe task list remains unchanged from last week, with the addition of volume\nmeters to the new price charting system. You can refer to the list below as a\nreminder of what we're working on:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\nWe anticipate deploying the changes shortly, allowing all users to update their\nlocal BasicSwap instances and take advantage of the new features.\n\nPART Now Available on Stack Wallet ?\nParticl Added to Stack Wallet (Mobile Wallet)The Particl coin is now officially\nsupported by the open-source and non-custodial mobile wallet\nStackWallet.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/]Earlier this\nweek, we announced that Particl is now officially available on the open-source\nand non-custodian mobile wallet Stack Wallet [https://stackwallet.com].\n\nThis integration allows you to securely store and manage your public PART coins\non-the-go with a user-friendly and intuitive interface, without compromising on\ndecentralization.\n\nFor further information regarding the integration process and to obtain the\nmobile application, please follow this link\n[https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/].\n\nParticl Ecosystem — 2022 in Review ?️\nLast week, we unveiled a Particl Core development progress visualizer\n[https://youtu.be/akPCMt7PFFI], and now we are delighted to announce the\navailability of a new visualizer that captures the development progress of the\nmain components of the entire Particl ecosystem, such as Particl Core, Particl\nDesktop, and BasicSwap DEX.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nOver the past week, our team has been focused on testing and executing minor\nadjustments for Particl Desktop 3.3. We have also been preparing for the\ncommencement of the upcoming development cycle and carefully assessing the most\neffective transition strategy to ensure a smooth process.\n\nWe are pleased to report that no significant issue has been found so far. As\nsuch, we are confident that the release will be ready for launch in the near\nfuture although we cannot communicate a precise mainnet release date yet.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. \n\nThis week, we have been working on a complex Bitcoin merge which has been\nrequiring a significant amount of time. \n\nAs highlighted in our yearly recap on Particl News, it is critical to maintain\nup-to-date upstream updates from Bitcoin in order to benefit from the entire\npool of talent and associated security, usability, and other improvements.\n\nThis is evident from CryptoMiso rankings [https://www.cryptomiso.com], where\nParticl Core currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed. Additionally, the\nvisualisation below shows the code updates made to Particl Core in 2022, and the\nnumber of developers working on the project, directly or indirectly. \n\nYou can monitor these changes by visiting this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week's more intricate Bitcoin merges have required a significant amount of\ntime.\n\nNonetheless, we have managed to address a few issues, particularly with the\nDocker-based configurations when executing BasicSwap in an isolated environment.\nAdditionally, we have remedied a bug that was causing the DEX to sometimes fail\nto validate the Bitcoin snapshot against its corresponding public key.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe have seen significant progress in regards to updating the user interface this\nweek. A wide array of fixes, optimizations, and enhancements have been included,\nand the offer table has been restructured to be more comprehensive and\nuser-friendly. This adds to the current ongoing tasks, which are the following:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\nWe anticipate deploying the changes shortly, allowing all users to update their\nlocal BasicSwap instances and take advantage of the new features.\n\nYear 2022 in Recap ?\n2022 in Review and What’s Coming in 2023Taking a look back at all the progress\nmade in 2022 and a glimpse of the future.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/2022-in-review/]Earlier this week, we proudly published a\ncomprehensive overview of the year 2022 and a glimpse of what's to come in 2023\nand beyond. As we reflect back on the year, it is clear that it was an\nincredibly successful one for the project and we're incredibly excited to jump\nright into 2023. \n\nWhile BasicSwap's open beta launch was a major milestone, many releases,\nincluding 16 for Particl Core, 8 for Particl Desktop, and the launch of a brand\nnew light wallet (Particl Electrum), kept the ecosystem blazing with progress\nall throughout. \n\nBut be assured, the best is yet to come and we're extremely confident for what\nstands ahead of us! Check out the article here\n[https://particl.news/2022-in-review/] to get all the crunchy details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
