Upgrade today!\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.4.0]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.4.0]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.4.0]\n\nImportant: Same as Particl Core wallet, users who haven’t updated to Particl\nDesktop (v1.4) or later by July 16th will NOT be on the main chain after the\nfork. We will send out another reminder 7–10 days ahead of July 16th to remind\nusers to update. Particl Desktop builds will be included in that reminder post.\n\n⭐️ For most users, the only important piece of information is summarized above. \nWe do have more details about Particl Core development included in this post.\nFor those interested to learn more, please, continue reading!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardfork Details\nThere are actually 2 hardforks coming to Particl in July— one for testnet, one\nfor mainnet.\n\n2019-07-01 12:00:00 UTC on testnet, hardfork to enable variable smsg difficulty.\n\n2019-07-16 12:00:00 UTC on mainnet, hardfork to enable ringCT transactions and\nbulletproofs.\n\nRelease notes: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.18/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01810\n\n? Testnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.01–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nSMSG variable difficulty gives the network a way to disable free smsg messages\nif someone starts spamming. By design, each free smsg has to hash in a certain\nway (like PoW). This makes the difficulty variable as opposed to hard-coded.\n\n? Mainnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.16–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable bulletproof rangeproofs.\n * Enable RingCT transactions.\n * Enable variable fee rate for smsg paid messages.\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nBulletproof rangeproofs are a much more efficient rangeproof than what has been\non the network to date. When we launched Particl with Confidential Transactions\n(CT) in 2017 a major difficulty was the size of blind transactions compared to \npublic transactions. CT transactions typically are 20x larger than non-CT\ntransactions. Bulletproofs can allow doubling the range size while still\nreducing transactions sizes by 65% or more.\n\n> Bulletproofs are much more general than rangeproofs. They can be used to prove,\nin zero knowledge, arbitrary statements. They are equivalent in power to SNARKs\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/507] or STARKs [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046],\nbut have native support for elliptic curve (EC) public keys and Pedersen\ncommitments (so there is typically no need to implement EC math inside a program\nbeing proven). Also, unlike SNARKs, Bulletproofs have full 128-bit security\nunder standard assumptions with no trusted setup. Unlike STARKs, they are fast\nenough to prove and verify reasonably-sized problems on typical computing\nhardware. —Andrew Poelstra\n[https://blockstream.com/2018/02/21/en-bulletproofs-faster-rangeproofs-and-much-more/]\nRingCT transactions are unlinkable and untraceable onchain transactions. RingCT\nis short for Ring Confidential Transactions. First described\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] by Shen Noether of XMR Labs, Particl’s\nversion is a complete ground-up build on the current Bitcoin codebase (0.18) by\nour very talented Lead Core developer Tecnovert.\n\n> For the record, this whole development update is directly tied to the phenomenal\nwork Tecnovert builds into Particl Core. Give him a big “Thank You!” next time\nyou stop in our Discord [https://discord.me/particl] | Open Development Channel.\nThe announcement of RingCT coming to the main chain is huge news for a number of\nyou waiting for fully anonymous PART transactions. Tecnovert first released\nRingCT onto the test chain in the middle of 2017 and we have had a number of\nrespected researchers, educators and code auditors review it over the last 2\nyears.\n\nThe last security audit preformed by Quarkslab has been sent to the team and\nreviewed. We will have more news about it when they publish the public audit. We\nchose to engage Quarkslab on our MLSAG/bulletproof algorithms because of their\nprevious work with identifying 4 major/3 minor vulnerabilities in Monero’s\nbulletproof security audit\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-audit-of-monero-bulletproofs.html].\n\nCold Staking Pool Operators\nTecnovert has raised the daemon version for the coldstakingpool code to\n0.18.0.10.\n\nA new version page is available here: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.txt\n\nDon’t Forget!\n? A planned hardfork on PART Mainnet is coming July 16th, 2019\nAfter July 16th, no nodes below 0.18.0.10 should be on the main chain. That\nmeans everyone will need to update to Particl Core v0.18.0.10 (or newer) before\n2019–07–16. For the procrastinators, you have 3 weeks!\n\nParticl Core v0.18.0.10 builds are ready now.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
