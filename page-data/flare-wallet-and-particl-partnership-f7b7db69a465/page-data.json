You’ll be\nable to set it up by either connecting to a staking node or a staking pool\n[https://particl.wiki/learn/staking/pools#available-staking-pools]!\n\nThis update is scheduled for in a few days!\n\nWhat is Cold Staking?\nCold staking is, in simple terms, the ability to delegate the staking power of\nyour coins to an external staking node that contains no coin. This staking node\ncan be hosted on any device, whether at home, on a VPS (cloud servers), or on\nany internet-connected device. Its only purpose is to stake on the network on\nbehalf of other wallets.\n\nCold staking significantly improves the security of your funds when staking.\nSince you’re putting in charge an external node to do the staking, you can store\nyour coins on any sort of device, online or off-line. That can be a cold wallet,\na hardware device (i.e. Ledger or Trezor), a mobile wallet (Particl Copay or\nFlare Wallet), a multi-signature address, and etc.\n\nIf your staking node ever gets breached into or hacked, the attacker wouldn’t be\nable to steal any coin as the node itself contains no coin at all. All it’s\ndoing is staking on the network using the weight of coins stored securely\nsomewhere else.\n\nTo learn how to set up your own cold staking node, check out this tutorial: \nhttps://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\n\nGuide: Setting up Particl Cold Staking\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4]\nA Node, a Wallet and a Smart Contractparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4]\n\nAvailable on the Mobile Wallet\nIn just a matter of days, Flare Wallet will be pushing a new update to its\nmobile wallet which will enable cold staking for Particl.\n\nDon’t worry about the mobile data cost of staking.

development of Particl V3.0 has been going\nparticularly smoothly which has allowed the Particl developers to make a lot of\nprogress on every front.\n\nHere is the latest development progress report from Particl’s Development\nManager Henk Swardt.\n\n> Note: All screenshots included in this update are work-in-progress and subject\nto change before the mainnet release. Most of the screenshots are not in their\nfinal version and will be tweaked/polished before going live.\nRecently Completed and Released Items\nParticl Desktop 2.3.4\nThe Particl team released Particl Desktop 2.3.4\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.4]. This update\nadded new coin icons for use with the current in-app swap engine implementation.\nThis kind of update won’t be required with the new swap engine implementation\ncoming for Particl Desktop V3.0.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.5\nParticl Desktop 2.3.5The Particl team released Particl Desktop 2.3.5\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.5]. This update\nprovides a new validation to ensure that the SMSG local address used in the\nmarketplace is still registered in core. This fixes the issue where some users\ncouldn’t decrypt SMSG messages addressed to them anymore, making it impossible\nto progress in escrow without manual commands being entered in the debug window.\n\nThis update also included a visual indicator in the menu bar of the ‘market’\nwallet notifying the user that bid messages (new orders, escrow progression,\netc) cannot be processed while the wallet is locked (clicking on the indicator\nprompts for the wallet to be unlocked).\n\nImproved Discord Tipbot\nParticl developer Ludx worked on an improved Discord tipbot built from scratch.\nThis improves on the previous bot’s performance and adds features such as user\nand pool accounts, user authorization, commands to check balances, deposit and\nwithdraw, tip, giveaway, and rain. The tipbot is currently enabled on Discord.\nJust join Particl’s server [http://discord.me/particl] and type %help to get\nstarted.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\nSell Section Layout Update (In Progress)\nIn the previous update, we mentioned that we had to make changes around how in\nthe ‘sell’ section the publishing of listings to single and multiple markets\nneeded some modifications. A rework of the layout was done for us to make the\nflow on the GUI feel seamless, where the backend needed to distinguish between\nBase templates and Market specific templates. This ensures that one could edit a\nmarket template specific to a market and save the details to be posted at a\nlater stage. The implementation of the re-worked layout is in progress.\n\nPull to Push Websocket Connection (Complete)\nIn order to improve the performance of the new 3.0 desktop application, a\nwebsocket connection to the marketplace engine allows for the Particl Desktop to\nreceive various push event notifications rather than polling for updates every\nfew seconds.\n\nMarket User Dashboard Improvements (Mostly Complete)\nMarket User Dashboard Preview (WIP)The Overview page of the market module has been recently improved on, ensuring\nall wallet info is displayed correctly. As the Sell and Buy sections of the\ndesktop application are completed, their respected section will be added to the\nOverview page. These include information like Sell and Buy page filters, new\nquestions on listings, funds locked in escrow, and various visual badges\nindicated your attention is needed somewhere.\n\nLink Listings to User Identity Instead of User Profile (Complete)\nWhile working on the Cart and Checkout integration we did pick up an issue where\nthe listings displayed in the cart were being identified at the profile level\nand this needed to be changed to the Identity level.\n\nWith the Profile as listing identifier, listings added to the cart from all\nsubscribed markets across all Identities would be displayed. This would mean\nthat continuing with the checkout, a buyer would need to pay for all items and\nmultiple wallets would need to be unlocked at a single time. For example, if the\nbuyer is browsing with Identity “A”, we ideally would want to only display\nlistings linked to that identity’s markets. This has been successfully changed\nand completed.\n\nListing Browser (In Progress)\nListings are now being created and displayed correctly with the correct\nCategories and Markets linked to them. All filtering and processing around the\nlistings are working as expected. There is still some integration left to be\ndone as other components get completed.\n\nNew Shipping Profiles section (Complete)\nEdit Shipping Profiles Page Preview (WIP)A new Shipping Profiles section for the\nmanaging of shipping addresses outside of the cart/checkout process has been\nadded to the new desktop application. This item is now complete.\n\nRefactored Market Functionalities (Complete)\nMarket Browser Preview (WIP)A bunch of core market functionalities have been\nrefactored and successfully integrated into the new desktop application. This\nincludes the display of listings, the flagging and voting of listing items,\nadding items to the cart and the checkout process, the favoriting of items, and\nthe managing of shipping profiles. These have all been marked as complete.\n\nNew Updated Place Bid Modal (Complete)\nIn the Cart section of the desktop application, the Place Bid modal has been\nredesigned to provide more information to the user and fit with the updated look\nof Particl Desktop.\n\nBug Fixes and General Improvements (Constantly in progress)\nWallet Encryption Modal Preview (WIP)A significant number of bug fixes and improvements to functionalities across the\nGUI implementation of the marketplace has been made. This, of course, is an\nongoing process and is always something on which the Particl developers are\nworking on at every release.\n\nUser Interface and User Experience Improvements (Constantly in progress)\nNew Batch Listing Modal Preview (WIP)As development goes on, numerous changes are being made to the design and layout \nof the desktop application to ensure the user has the best possible flow and\ninteraction within the GUI. This is an ongoing process and is always being\nworked on at every release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Changes to the Market Codebase\nSince the last Development Update, a lot of changes have been successfully\nimplemented into the new market codebase (the underlying “backend” code of the\nmarketplace).\n\nHere’s a detailed list of all the recent changes:\n\n * Changes in ListingItemTemplates with market specific ListingItemTemplate and\n   versioning support.\n * Added additional validations for all marketplace messages.\n * All search commands refactored, added more validations.\n * Changes in ListingItemAdd/Vote message signing.\n * ShoppingCart linked to Identity rather than Profile.\n * Identity Vote calculations fixed.\n * Added push notifications for new Proposals.\n * Market specific ItemCategory support.\n * Market specific Proposals.\n * Bug fixes related to ListingItem/Image message separation.\n * Added Default Market and Profile commands.\n * OMP Library changes/bug fixes.\n * Smaller and larger API changes in ~45 of ~115 RPC commands.\n * Fixed some issues running the market with node v12.\n * Fixed/changed/added around 900 automated and integration test cases.\n * A number of changes all around as a result of the test case results.\n * Marketplace 0.2.10 bugfix release.\n\n> Note: Automating the build/upload into a more regular process is planned to be\nlooked into again soon after the v3.0 release.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDirect Buyer/Seller Communications Coming to V3.0\nA new and highly anticipated functionality is making its way onto Particl\nDesktop 3.0 — buyer and seller communications.\n\nNew Buyer/Seller Communications Section Preview (WIP)Whether you are a seller or\na buyer, this major improvement to the Question and Answer feature will let you\ncommunicate with the party you’re transacting with in case there is a need for\nit. It uses the same system as the Question and Answer section and is integrated\ndirectly as part of the escrow process.\n\nCommunication is vital for any mistake or issue to be resolved. But it also\nopens up the door to fraud, blackmail, and scam. For this reason, all messages\nsent between the two parties are publicly recorded directly in the Question and\nAnswer section. The system is directly linked to the user market dashboard and\nnotifies you whenever you receive a question or answer.\n\n> Note: This communication module is different than the encrypted instant\nmessaging app being worked on by DeMarkets.io. Keep reading for more details on\nit.\nThis completely transparent solution is to keep both parties in check and ensure\nthat they do not use this communications module to blackmail or threaten the\nother party which would then weaken the game-theory behind Particl’s two-party\nescrow system. Of course, it doesn’t prevent two users from exchanging contact\ninformation (i.e. sharing their Particl chat keys with each other or using a\nthird-party messaging app like Telegram), but it provides a great level of\ntransparency that can be used for vendors to build a reputation for themselves.\nBut more importantly than anything, it simply provides the ability for two\ntransacting users to touch base and resolve issues.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates From DeMarkets.io\nDeMarkets.ioOver the last few weeks, the DeMarkets.io [http://DeMarkets.io] developers have\nbeen quite active. If you don’t know about DeMarkets.io already, a web browser\nfor decentralized marketplaces with additional features to come and have been\ncontributing to the Particl project for the last several months. Their website\ncurrently displays Particl Marketplace statistics and provides a listing browser\nthat lets you see marketplace listings from the web, without having to download\nParticl Desktop.\n\nDeMarkets.io has recently been working on two items that will be major\ncontributors to the Particl ecosystem. Here’s an update on each of them.\n\nNew DeMarkets.io Website\nThe DeMarkets team has been working on a major update to its website that\nchanges most of it. This update is planned to be released shortly and adds the\nability to view and share individual listings. It also lets you create shops on\nthe website so that you can aggregate and easily showcase your listings as a\nvendor. DeMarkets estimates the update will go live within the next 1 to 2 weeks\n.\n\nEncrypted Instant Messaging App (Particl Desktop)\nTheir team has also been working on an encrypted instant messaging application\nthat will be integrated as a new Particl Desktop module. The app is powered by\nSMSG and lets users safely communicate without worrying about any third-party\nbeing able to intercept and read messages.\n\nThe encrypted instant messaging app is still under development and has taken a\nsecond priority, behind the release of DeMarkets.io’s new website. It is\ncurrently scheduled to go live shortly after Particl V3.0.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt’s All Coming Together Nicely\nAs you can see, the Particl developers have been putting the pedal to the metal\nfor the last few weeks so that they can complete the remaining items required\nfor launching Particl V3.0 as fast as possible.\n\nThe great majority of the core components required for it to be ready are now\ncomplete or are well on their way to being ready. This leaves fewer and fewer\nitems left to integrate into the new desktop application and brings us closer to\nthe release every day.\n\nKeep in mind, Particl V3.0 is Particl’s biggest update to date. It not only\nsignificantly changes the marketplace codebase but also the desktop application\nas a whole. For this reason, this particular update has taken much longer to be\nready than other past releases, but the difference in user experience will\nabsolutely speak for itself.\n\nParticl V3 is going to be much faster, lightweight, easier to use, and\nfeature-complete than it has ever been.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--10-08-2020-/1-sHXTBG2Awq9mmhexu0LdzA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"particl-v3-0-updates-and-more\">Particl V3.0 Updates and More</h3><p>In the past few weeks, the development of Particl V3.0 has been going particularly smoothly which has allowed the Particl developers to make a lot of progress on every front.</p><p>Here is the latest development progress report from Particl’s Development Manager Henk Swardt.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> All screenshots included in this update are work-in-progress and subject to change before the mainnet release.

?\nParticl Desktop 2.3.5 has just been released and includes one important fix as\nwell as a new indicator letting users know that they need to unlock their market\nwallet to receive orders and progress through the escrow process.\n\nSMSG Decryption Improvement\nTo receive orders and progress through escrow, SMSG messages are sent between\nthe buyer and the seller’s Particl Desktop.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop.
