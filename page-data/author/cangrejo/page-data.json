This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n, we touched on the progressive evolution of atomic swap technology, bringing us\nall the way to a comprehensive atomic swap-based DEX framework that is able to\nsupport coins with no scripting language support, such as Part(Anon) and XMR.\nThis, of course, plays towards our eventual goal to integrate the BasicSwap\nprotocol into other access gateways, most notably a web-based DEX and a\nseamlessly integrated Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] \nintegration, in an ongoing effort to bring truly decentralized, private\ne-commerce to the widest audience possible.\n\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol already boasts a wide array of different coins,\neach with their own advantages and communities, two big pieces are still being\nconsidered for integration into BSX: stablecoins, and the extremely popular\nEthereum ecosystem. Of course, being able to integrate the latter would\nimmediately make the integration of a number of stablecoins trivial, as many\nstablecoins already exist as ETH tokens.\n\nThese are some thoughts on what a PART(Anon)-ETH and XMR-ETH swap integration\ninto a comprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap could look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Existing XMR-ETH Swap\n\nPeople who had the pleasure to witness Elizabeth Bink [https://github.com/noot]\n’s Monerotopia presentation on XMR-ETH swaps may have developed a curiosity\ntowards hyper-private Ethereum swaps and what they entail, perhaps most\nimportantly in the hopes of facilitating untraceable, decentralized swaps\nbetween privacy coins and stablecoins (or simply ETH itself).\n\nElizabeth and the open source project AthanorLabs\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] achieved the first XMR-ETH atomic\nswap earlier this year, and presented it to the world at the Monerotopia\nconference in Mexico City, on May 6th. Using their own breakthrough protocol,\nAthanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring\nto the table, to achieve for the first time a bona fide atomic swap between the\ntwo currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations\nto integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap\nworks and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly\nmore interesting for our purposes.\n\nUnder The Hood\nXMR, of course, and as we’ve discussed at length\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic HTLC swap\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], where both coins need some\nbasic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.\n\nETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people\nfamiliar with the semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4] \nthat the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that\nthe “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nAs it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless\nadaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of\ntoday fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is\nthat Ethereum is account-based\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/], and not UTXO-based.\n\nThe Challenges of an Account-based Architecture\nIn short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to\ndecrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account\nbalance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based\ntransaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique nonce\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp]. To that end, the nonce is\npublicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that\nthe same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.\n\nThis breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires\nrefund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a\ntransaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could\nthen send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and\nwhen the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed\ntransaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).\n\nPre-signing in adaptor signature swapsAthanorLab's solution is to make use of\nEthereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the\nswap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless\n- but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the\nnecessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by\nthe powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC\n(where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than\nadaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the\nside without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other\ntransaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the\ntransaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even\nwith sophisticated chain analysis tools.\n\nSo, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal\nlogic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds —\nincluding Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both\ninadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a\nfull integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.\n\nA snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG networkCurrent\nProtocol Limitations\nAn important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is\nthat ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in.\nThat means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only\none side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. \n\nThe RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund\nin case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks\nfirst, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder\nlocks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked\nforever. This means that the swap itself always has to be structured in one way,\nwith XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at\nthe protocol level.\n\nAnother underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even\nadvertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the\nEthereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided\nfor by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another\nreason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder\nto lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could\neasily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or\nmultiple offers, and back out.\n\nThis unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's\nparameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective\nquantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have\nlittle say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the\npreferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. \n\nAthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interfaceLooking Ahead\nMuch like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, BasicSwap's intention is to leverage\nthe SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed\nXMR-ETH swap protocol.\n\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nRemember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps\ndidn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic\nswap protocol. Instead, we leveraged the SMSG network to simulate offers\nfeaturing Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n.

However, they\nnecessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have\nprogrammable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for\na wide array of coins, but not for Monero.\n\nAs the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important\nfor BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of\nfinancial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital\ncash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom\nactors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.\n\nThat’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed a\nnew Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf]. This breakthrough development, a\nproduct of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years,\nfinally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without\nthe need for programmable outputs.\n\n> Note: For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our\nrecent blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n.\nThe Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps\nWhile the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a\nsignificant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only\noperate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an\natomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer'\nand a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).\n\nThe offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap\nrequest, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder,\nin contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon\nagreement, initiates the swap process.\n\nThe offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested\ncoins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other\nparameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are\nnot specifically pertinent to this article's context.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's order bookDue to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless\natomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more\naccurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This\nstipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable\noutputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being\noffered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.\n\nTo better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which\ndescribes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from\nthe perspective of the 'offerer'.\n\nSee flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\nNote that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin —\na Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the\nMonero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a\nMonero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold\nMonero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else\nrequesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you\nmust create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.\n\nThis restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and\nadds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard\nfunctionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized\ntrading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact\nrate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a\nsolution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages\nenjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.\n\nBidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?\nWe are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero\natomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and\naccessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on\nMonero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request\nAND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.\n\nHow was it Accomplished?\nMonero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct\nconsequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting\ncapabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.\n\nAs such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or\nmaking extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic\nswap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and\ntransaction size management, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements]\n).\n\nInstead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the SMSG\nnetwork\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nwith a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a\nDEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and\nmore accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges.\nTherefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.\n\nLeveraging the SMSG Network\nOn BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order\nbook, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate\nan offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the\nmaker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHowever, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology,\nas we've outlined in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before]\n, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a\ndecentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see \nthis article\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nfor more information on SMSG).\n\nThe SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making\nBasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the\nkey to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.\n\nSimulating Offers Requesting Monero\nOur solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on\nmodifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol.\nInstead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.\n\nIn reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature\nprotocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional.\nHowever, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process —\npowered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be\noffered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the\nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end\nuser and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nRefer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier\nin this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of\nexecuting a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap\nDEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.\n\nSee reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\nFrom this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few\nmore steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without\nnecessitating further human intervention.\n\nIndeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap\ninstead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder. A bid is\nthen constructed from this request and the protocol proceeds as normal, just\nwith the parties transposed.\n\nTechnical Documentation\ndoc: Describe reverse adaptor sig protocol. · tecnovert/basicswap@be46d8aBasic\nAtomic Swap Proof of Concept.

Now, in contrast to the previous setup where Monero could only be\nchosen as the requested coin, you also have the option to offer it when placing\na new offer on the order book.\n\nThere are no extra steps or additional prerequisites involved. However, remember\nthat this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with\nsome additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're\nrequesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just\nlike any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. \n\nTo benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure\nthat your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version. To\ninstall it, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image.\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command.\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build command.\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nIf you're not using the Docker setup, you can follow the Particl Academy's\nstep-by-step update guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nWhat Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\nThe introduction of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps for all symbolizes a\nmonumental step towards establishing a privacy-first, resilient global economy\nthat is fair to all.\n\nIndeed, we've observed a steady increase in aggressive, restrictive measures\ntargeting privacy coins like Particl and Monero in recent years, a trend that\nhas only accelerated in recent weeks. As evidenced by the removal of the\ncryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the\naccessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals\nworldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are\nbeing enforced is only likely to speed up over time.\n\nFurthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial\ncryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or,\nat the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the\nworld, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as\nBasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that\ncryptocurrencies like Monero and truly decentralized and self-custodial\nsolutions like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various\nglobal regulations, are needed.\n\nDecentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\nFortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate\nentirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed\nand serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's\nwidespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its\nsurvival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.\n\nHowever, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing\nchallenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has\nresulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular\ncryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor\nsignature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to\nexecute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant\nbarrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.\n\nThe integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX\nmarks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance\nof today's announcement.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nOf course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance,\nBasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains\nrelatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process\nwith the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher,\nthe resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized\nexchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.\n\nThis fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that\nwill equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading\nplatforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness\nBasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without\nhaving to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web\nwallets.\n\nWhile this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of\nbidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for\nthe development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime\nfocus moving forward.\n\nWe encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at Particl News\n[https://particl.news] for updates on this topic.

To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This stipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable outputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being offered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.</p><p>To better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which describes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from the perspective of the 'offerer'.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png 1264w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Note that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin — a Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the Monero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness BasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without having to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web wallets.</p><p>While this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for the development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime focus moving forward.</p><p>We encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a></strong> for updates on this topic.

However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness BasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without having to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web wallets.</p><p>While this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for the development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime focus moving forward.</p><p>We encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a></strong> for updates on this topic.

To\nthat end, it can be stated that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized\nand potentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the previous installment\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n\nof this series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, we discussed the history and development of atomic swap technologies, and the\ntechnical peculiarities and challenges of integrating them within a\ncomprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap DEX. Similar challenges are also\npresent in bringing the BasicSwap protocol towards web accessibility, which we\nwill explore in this article.\n\nA Foundation for Private and Accessible DEX Environments\nBasicSwapDEXMeet BasicSwap, the privacy-first and cross-chain DEX. Swap coins\nlike Bitcoin and Monero on a trading platform that’s free, unstoppable, and\nconfidential. By the Particl Project.BasicSwapDEX [https://basicswapdex.com/]\nThose familiar with the early beta of the BasicSwap protocol\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/] understand that,\nwhile the technology is incredibly powerful and allows for probably the easiest\nXMR-BTC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE] or\nPart(ANON)-BTC decentralized swaps available anywhere\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE], it is at the cost of a relatively\ninvolved process. For example, unless you wish to swap a coin pair which\nblockchains you have already downloaded, the time necessary to get a new\nblockchain up to speed can be impractical for many users. Furthermore, simply\naccessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and\nattention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for\nmany.\n\nThankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably a more\nstraightforward and less complicated install process\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-] \n— are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but\nparticularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on\nthe BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the\nBasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror\nto the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users\nto connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light\nservices or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have\nto pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third\nparties involved at any point.\n\nIn addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap\napplication already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important\nfeature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of\nadditional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current\ndevelopment focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized HTLC and Adaptor Sig\nswaps [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] available on the BSX\nnetwork. \n\nThe goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a\nplug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps,\nwhich addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on\nthe other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience\nthat characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.\n\nOur Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways\n\nTo honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap\nprotocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.\n\nFirst of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with\nregards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some\nof the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must\nkeep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from\nthe convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general\ntransparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses,\nsmart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and\npeer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.\n\nA second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based\nBasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web\nusers to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order\nbook, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private\norder books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end,\ninvesting development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and\nincentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be\ninstrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based\nDEX.\n\nThirdly, continuing our commitment to modular software architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] will ensure the\nexceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform\nvia the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG\nnetwork (1\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/])\nin the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high\nexpectations of BasicSwap DEX. This design philosophy also makes the platform\nmore scalable, both at the gateway level and at the protocol level.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeveloping the Economy of Tomorrow\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol itself is still in beta and that many of the\nnecessary building blocks towards a smooth, user-friendly atomic swap web DEX\nare still in the works, behind-the-scenes development of BasicSwap is going\nsplendidly, and a working beta of such a revolutionary web-based exchange\nplatform is well in progress.

This aims to bring\ndeCommerce to unprecedented levels of accessibility and resilience, even\nallowing users to compound the privacy benefits of multiple cryptos and swapping\nprotocols — a formidable building block towards a common, truly decentralized\nfinancial system open to all.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their\nhistory, make sure to give these articles a read!\n\n * Atomic Swap Style Showdown [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 3\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-private-ethereum-swaps/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

For example, unless you wish to swap a coin pair which blockchains you have already downloaded, the time necessary to get a new blockchain up to speed can be impractical for many users. Furthermore, simply accessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and attention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for many.</p><p>Thankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-\">a more straightforward and less complicated install process</a> — are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but particularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on the BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the BasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror to the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users to connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light services or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have to pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third parties involved at any point.</p><p>In addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap application already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important feature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of additional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current development focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized <a href=\"https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/\">HTLC and Adaptor Sig swaps</a> available on the BSX network. </p><p>The goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a plug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps, which addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on the other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience that characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.</p><h2 id=\"our-vision-for-basicswap-s-access-gateways\">Our Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways</h2><p><br>To honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap protocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.</p><p>First of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with regards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some of the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must keep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from the convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general transparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses, smart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and peer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.</p><p>A second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based BasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web users to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order book, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private order books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end, investing development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and incentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be instrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based DEX.</p><p>Thirdly, continuing <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">our commitment to modular software architecture</a> will ensure the exceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform via the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG network (<a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">2</a>) in the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high expectations of BasicSwap DEX. This design philosophy also makes the platform more scalable, both at the gateway level and at the protocol level.</p><hr><h2 id=\"developing-the-economy-of-tomorrow\">Developing the Economy of Tomorrow</h2><p>Although the BasicSwap protocol itself is still in beta and that many of the necessary building blocks towards a smooth, user-friendly atomic swap web DEX are still in the works, behind-the-scenes development of BasicSwap is going splendidly, and a working beta of such a revolutionary web-based exchange platform is well in progress.

increasingly attractive\nalternative to centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency trades. The spectacular\nfailures of some centralized exchanges, like the Celsius debacle or last\nwinter’s implosion of the FTX exchange where billions of dollars of customer’s\nfunds were stolen obviously does nothing to help this climate.\n\nThere is, at the heart of the CEX vs DEX dynamic, a fundamental divide; while\nbig centralized entities suit traditional market logic, and can adapt these\nprinciples to fuel their own growth, they go against the fundamental principle\nof blockchain and cryptocurrency itself: private, peer-to-peer money.\n\nA Path Ahead\nIt could be argued that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized,\npotentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies. They are, of course,\nextremely resilient — as long as the blockchain accepts your transaction and you\nhave a reliable, hopefully private way to communicate with the other person, you\ncan swap. This, in effect, makes them exactly as decentralized as the\nblockchains involved. It also opens the door to entirely eliminating trust from\nthe process, unlike centralized models where you have to trust entities such as\nBinance, Celsius or FTX, and give them full control of your keys.\n\nIt was the Decred team who first made this technology a practical reality\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], with their implementation of the first\nHTLC-based atomic swaps. At their core, HTLC swaps are easy to understand. They\ninvolve 'Hashed Timelock Contracts', which are types of smart contracts, on both\nthe buyer and seller sides. This means that both blockchains must have Timelock\nand Hashlock capabilities.\n\nBesides this limiting requirement, the HTLC swap also lacks privacy. While it\nallows for trustless, atomic swap exchanges to exist, it also creates a new\nproblem with it: when making a swap, a secret is created, hashed out, and\ninscribed, minutes apart, in the blockchains of both participating blockchains.\nThe problem here is that while this allows the protocol to verify the\ntransaction and move through the next steps of a swap, it also makes it trivial\nfor outside observers to infer the two participants of a swap, as well as what\namount of money is being exchanged. Here, an important privacy issue must be\naddressed.\n\nPoint Time Locked Contract Swaps and Adaptor Signatures\nAn important stepping stone to making atomic swaps the trustless, decentralized\nand hyper-private powerhouse that it can be lays in adaptor signatures.\n\nAs we explored in this piece [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/],\nthe adaptor signature atomic swap scheme, otherwise referable to as \"Point Time\nLocked Contract (PTLC) swaps, begins with Andrew Poelstra’s work on scriptless\nscripts. Poelstra’s work was born out of necessity to interact with\nMimbleWimble, an extremely rigid blockchain protocol. These scriptless scripts\nexploit the linear nature of Schnorr signatures\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-schnorr-signatures]: by\nusing Schnorr signatures in clever ways that are expanded further in this\narticle [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], or in greater\ntechnical detail here [https://hongchao.me/scriptless-script/].\n\nPoelstra’s work, in any case, makes it possible to replicate certain smart\ncontract capabilities without needing any of the actual smart contract language\na given coin may have. The adaptor signature swap, as such, is an example of a\nscriptless script.\n\nHowever, and this is important, Bitcoin and Monero do not use Schnorr signatures\nin its cryptographic signature algorithm — instead, they use a classic Elliptic\nCurve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA. There are a lot of differences\nbetween the two that we will not get into today, but suffice to say, adaptor\nsignature swaps on blockchain protocols using ECDSA curves, like Particl's PART,\nwould fall under the category of \"semi-scriptless protocols\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-on-ecdsa-cac148dfa3ad]\".\n\nThere is a huge benefit here compared to HTLC swaps, other than the fact that it\nenables PART's anon transaction type and other RingCT coins such as XMR to be\natomically swapped: they do not rely on identical hashes that need to be\ninscribed on the participating blockchains.\n\nOf course, in the case of RingCT based coins, that wouldn’t be much of a problem\neven if we were able to swap them using traditional HTLC swaps — which, again,\nis not possible on ECDSA schemes — because the hashes would be completely\nhidden.\n\nBut the beautiful thing here is that adaptor signature swaps can actually apply\nto a vast number of cryptocurrencies, and at the same time, make the swaps much,\nmuch more private.\n\nPre-Signed Transactions\nAn important aspect to the adaptor signature swap scheme is the use of\npre-signed refund transactions to solve the inherent problem of incomplete\nswaps, and achieve trustless, infallible atomic swaps while operating within the\nconfines of semi-scriptless protocols.\n\nPre-signing the refund transaction, addressing the XMR-BTC unhappy path problem.\nLet’s take a look at an atomic swap where Alice tries to swap 1 BTC with Bob for\n1 XMR. The first thing they do is pre-sign the refund transactions for Bitcoin.\nThis can be compared to signing the divorce papers before you get married. This\nallows them to split amicably even if one disappears and leaves the other\nstranded. Now at that very moment in time, the refund transaction is useless\nbecause they haven't deposited any money — much like you cannot file a divorce\nif you’ve never gotten married in the first place.\n\nThis is mandatory to making adaptor signature based swaps a functional reality\nin the real world, as any widespread implementations needs to account for\nincomplete swaps, interrupted flows, and other \"unhappy\" paths.\n\nAdditional Privacy and Scalability Improvements\nDuring the implementation of adaptor signature-based swaps into the BasicSwap\nDEX, we scrutinized the code to identify possible improvements that could be\nincorporated into the technology. The creation of this novel atomic swap type\nhas been a testament to open-source collaboration, and it's only fitting that we\ncontribute back to the community.\n\nAnd so, we ended up identifying a method to boost the privacy of PTLC swaps\nfurther and decrease the transaction size by adjusting a specific code segment.\n\nOriginal logic:\n\nOP_IF\n\tOP_SHA256 <hs> OP_EQUALVERIFY\n\t2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ELSE\n\t<t0> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n\t2 <Bra> <Brb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ENDIF\n\nSource:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf\nSimplified logic:\n\n2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n\nWith this change, adaptor signature-based swaps now look like any other 2-of-2\nmulti-signature transaction on the blockchain.

upcoming Monerotopia speech\n[https://monerotopia.com/], and expanding on some of the topics raised in this\nprevious article [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]\n, this article goes over our thoughts on privacy and interoperability in\nprivacy-centric projects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe current state of the world is a cause for great concern, particularly for\nthose who support freedom and oppose censorship, value independent thought, and\nprioritize personal privacy. Global economies are facing an unprecedented\ncrisis, and governments are enacting increasingly oppressive measures that\nthreaten individual autonomy, even discussing outright bans on encryption. It is\nbecoming increasingly difficult to protect one's freedom on a daily basis.\n\nFortunately, the advent of Bitcoin provided a glimmer of hope. In the years to\ncome, the release of Bitcoin may likely be viewed as one of the most influential\nevents in modern history, given that blockchain and decentralized networks\nprovide us with concrete tools to resist those who seek to restrict our rights\nand freedoms.\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto brought this incredible gift to the world, humanity stood\non the precipice. However, Satoshi's legacy now rests with us, as we continue to\npush the boundaries of privacy coins by adding more robust obfuscation layers\nand anonymizing transactions, thereby preventing cryptocurrencies from becoming\na financial surveillance tool.\n\nUltimately, the cypherpunk mission, as bold as it is, is to build a parallel\neconomy, completely independent and separate from the global fiat system, in\nwhich its users can accomplish their everyday needs without having to depend on\nlegacy financial systems anymore.\n\nThis article is about the survival of our privacy and liberties within a world\nthat is actively seeking to destroy them and what we believe the path forward\nis.\n\nPrivacy, Intercompatibility, and Resilience\nCompetition can be a driving force for progress, motivating individuals to\nperform better, increase productivity, and push the boundaries of innovation,\nultimately resulting in enhanced benefits for end-users.\n\nHowever, while this holds true in crypto, it also creates avoidable tensions\nbetween projects and often leads to a situation where the innovations of one\nproject are overlooked by those who do not possess a financial stake in that\nparticular project. This division in the community limits our collective\ncapacity to address the imminent challenges to privacy that we previously\noutlined, a suboptimal outcome given the substantial force wielded by those who\nseek to undermine our freedoms.\n\nUltimately, to stand a chance against this opposition, we should strive to\nembrace our uniqueness and foster creativity; different projects working on\ndifferent ideas and solutions, but we must unite together in a decentralized,\nprivate, and free economy in which all of our projects thrive and can be\nintegrated.\n\nTo do just that, we are presently focused on a comprehensive improvement of our\necosystem codebase\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], which is\ndesigned to reflect our core values. Among them:\n\n * Privacy, obviously.\n * Uncompromising decentralization.\n * And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies\n   with which our dApps function.\n\nWith an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy\nprojects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This\nallows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing\nwithin an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys\nextremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.\n\nEmbodying Agnosticism\nThe Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are\ncurrently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing\nfor various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order\nto power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.\n\nFor instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own\nnative SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our\nmodular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and\nonly request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an\nSMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.\n\nAdopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other\ncompatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps.\nThe final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements\nof their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.\n\nThis not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use\ncases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to\nParticl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have\nworked on.\n\nIt also makes them more resilient.\nConsider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable\nits distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that\nSMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event.\nAlthough such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a\nminor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an\nalternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user\nwould lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers\nfails to act in a timely manner.\n\nThis is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas\nother projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without\ncompeting with each other but without having to start developing together. We\ncould sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples,\nbut I think you get the gist.\n\nBecause technology advances so fast, we must build solutions that will endure\nthe test of time. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger,\ntogether, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the\nperfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.\n\nHowever, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules.\nAfter all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have\nunique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.\n\nIn our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in\nwhich SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl\ndApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying\nthe different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy\nand freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.\n\nCurrency Agnosticism \nCurrency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in\nprivacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example:\nyou can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without\nthird-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely\ndifferent coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so.\nThis introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in\norder to acquire this specific coin.\n\nThat is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re\ncurrently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for\nother coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end\nswap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.\n\nWhile several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges,\ncan be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal\noutcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by the Changelly\ndebacle\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/] \nwithin the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a free,\nindependent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy without central points of\nfailure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.\n\nWhat Privacy Ramifications?\nWhile designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling\npossibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency\nprojects, it also offers much more than just convenience or a 'preferred\ncurrency for payments.'\n\nLet’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a\ncryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy\ntechnology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous\ntransactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions\nusing decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their\ncoins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using\nzero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.\n\nThis is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and\ncons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and\ncosts. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with\nother privacy setups.\n\nLet us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl\nMarketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which\nuses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the\ntransaction using any currency.\n\nNow, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus\ntransaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides\nyou with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send\nthe coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem\ntoken is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to\nbuy the item on the marketplace.\n\nBy this simple act, you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine\nboth Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction, compounding both\nof their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example\nof what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy\ntech.\n\nAgnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace\nAlthough the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in\na truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique\nproperties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer\nfor all Particl Marketplace transactions.\n\nThere are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via\nthe use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace,\nand perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear\nthat the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment\nsystems are limitless.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Among them:</p><ul><li>Privacy, obviously.</li><li>Uncompromising decentralization.</li><li>And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies with which our dApps function.</li></ul><p>With an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy projects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This allows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing within an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys extremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.</p><h2 id=\"embodying-agnosticism\">Embodying Agnosticism</h2><p>The Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are currently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing for various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order to power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.</p><p>For instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own native SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our modular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and only request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an SMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.</p><p>Adopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other compatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps. The final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements of their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.</p><p>This not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use cases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to Particl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have worked on.</p><h3 id=\"it-also-makes-them-more-resilient-\">It also makes them more resilient.</h3><p>Consider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable its distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that SMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event. Although such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a minor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an alternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user would lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers fails to act in a timely manner.</p><p>This is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas other projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without competing with each other but without having to start developing together. We could sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples, but I think you get the gist.</p><p>Because technology advances so fast, <strong>we must build solutions that will endure the test of time</strong>. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger, together, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the perfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.</p><p>However, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules. After all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have unique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.</p><p>In our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in which SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl dApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying the different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy and freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.</p><h2 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism </h2><p>Currency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in privacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example: you can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without third-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely different coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so. This introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in order to acquire this specific coin.</p><p>That is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re currently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for other coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end swap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.</p><p>While several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges, can be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal outcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/\">the Changelly debacle</a> within the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a <strong>free, independent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy</strong> without central points of failure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.</p><h3 id=\"what-privacy-ramifications\">What Privacy Ramifications?</h3><p>While designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling possibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency projects, <strong>it also offers much more than just convenience</strong> or a 'preferred currency for payments.'</p><p>Let’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a cryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy technology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous transactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions using decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their coins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using zero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.</p><p>This is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and cons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and costs. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with other privacy setups.</p><p>Let us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl Marketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which uses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the transaction using any currency.</p><p>Now, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus transaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides you with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send the coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem token is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to buy the item on the marketplace.</p><p>By this simple act, <strong>you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine both Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction</strong>, compounding both of their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example of what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy tech.</p><h2 id=\"agnosticism-part-and-the-particl-marketplace\">Agnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace</h2><p>Although the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in a truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique properties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer for all Particl Marketplace transactions.  </p><p>There are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via the use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace, and perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear that the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment systems are limitless.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

the open source BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol may have noticed some mentions of two different kinds of cross-chain\natomic swaps, namely “adaptor sig” swaps and “secret hash” swaps. \n\nThis article will explore the distinctions between the two kinds of swaps, their\ndifferences, and how the BasicSwap protocol leverages both to offer a truly\ndecentralized and remarkably private basis for decentralized exchanges.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is an Atomic Swap?\nAn atomic swap, simply speaking, is a type of contract that enables a\ndecentralized cryptocurrency transaction. “Atomic”, in this case, implies that\nthe change of ownership of one asset should effectively imply the change of\nownership of the other. First conceptualized in 2013 by TierNolan on the\nBitcointalk forums\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765], this\nfirst iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts),\nwould need four more years to finally see the light of day.\n\nAtomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside\nmiddleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic\nmeans they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and\nas such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and\nothers.\n\nIn the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of\nswaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial\nagreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two\nparties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's\nown encrypted mixnet, the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThe Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps\nThe first successful implementation of atomic swaps came from the Decred project\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\",\nwith the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic\nswap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as\na \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.\n\nTechnically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound\ncryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first\nimplementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a\ncryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract within a set timeframe \n(established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be\nreturned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the\ntransaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating\nblockchains to have both Hashlock and Timelock capabilities - a condition that\nleaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private\nMonero blockchain.\n\nThese two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:\n\nA hashlock is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of\nfunds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a\ncryptographic proof, in the form of a hash\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function]).\n\n\nA timelock is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific\ntime (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs\nwithin a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not\ncompleted, without a need for a third party adjudicator.\n\nThe graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides\na visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each\nparty performs:\n\n\n\nA HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.\n\nIn other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: \n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and\nEther) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a\ncryptographic hash function to generate hash, h. She then creates an HTLC\ncontract using h, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed\n(spent) using the secret s, or they will be returned to her after a certain\namount of time, t, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the\nother chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, h. Since Alice knows\nthe original secret, s, which was used to produce the hash, h, she can redeem\nthe Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret s to Bob, who can\nthen take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.\n\nWithout diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a\nsuccessful HTLC swap as described in the graph above, the \"secret hash\" involved\nin them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash\nswaps\". For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in\nsecret hash swaps is available on the Decred atomic swap github page\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap].\n\nSome Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps\nAlthough they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of decentralized \nexchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic\nswap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place on-chain,\nwhich has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.\n\nWhenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both\nblockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately\nsophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins\ninvolved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other,\ntimestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is\neasily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from\nsuch an analysis, it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the\nidentity of the participants involved.\n\nThe Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps\nThe second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\"\nswaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept.\n2020 paper titled \"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126]. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an\nimplementation of Lloyd Fournier’s work\n[https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf] on One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. Adaptor Signatures.\n\nThis type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it\nis impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a\ndifferent method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by\nthe non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that\nthese prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap\nprotocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style\ndecentralized UTXO model\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output], and that have Segwit\nor a Segwit-equivalent malleability fix\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability], such as Litecoin.\n\nThose \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor\nsignature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying\nmath behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an additional signature that\nis combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor\nsignatures enable two parties to reveal two pieces of data to each other\nsimultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless\nprotocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.\n\nHow Does It Work?\nThis part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on\nthe privacy distinctions between both swaps.\n\nThe graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary\ntransfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on\nBSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case\nof BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:\n\nAn \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.In other words,\nadaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:\n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to\nexchange. Just like in the case of “secret hash” swaps, this is achieved in a\nprivate and decentralized way in BasicSwap via its distributed order book.\n\nNote that a property of Monero is that the sum of public keys will match the\npublic key for the sum of private keys. By sending XMR to the sum of the public\nkeys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the\nHLTC protocol.\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\nAlice and Bob each pick two secret (ECC) private keys (BTC and XMR), and swap\none set of public keys with each other. Here, three different keys are involved\nfor each side.\n\nAlice sends a BTC transaction with an output to a multisig output, which\nrequires a signature from both Alice and Bob in order to spend it. Once that\noccurs, Bob sees the BTC tx and sends the XMR tx to the XMR public key sum, as\nmentioned above.\n\nAlice signs for her private key and encumbers that signature with Bob's\nxmr_public_key.\n\nShe sends that adaptor signature to Bob. This adaptor signature is not a\ntransaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it does\ncommit to a secret value (Alice’s private key).\n\nBob then decodes the adaptor signature with his xmr_private key and then signs\nfor the BTC lock tx with his btc_private key.\n\nAs Bob now has a valid signature from Alice and himself, he can now spend from\nthe locked BTC tx.\n\nAlice watches the BTC chain for the tx that spends the lock tx. With Bob's\nsignature, which is broadcast publicly on the Bitcoin side once the Bitcoin\nlocked transaction is redeemed, she can recover Bob's xmr_private key.\n\nAlice, now endowed with both her and Bob's xmr_private keys, can spend from the\nXMR lock transaction, concluding the exchange.\n\n“****in’ VOILA” - Dr. Danny Duberstein accomplishing a BTC->XMR adaptor sig\natomic swap for the first time (allegedly)Some Advantages of Adaptor Signature\nSwaps\nAtomic swaps using adaptor signatures have several advantages over traditional\natomic swaps involving HTLCs.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the adaptor signature swap scheme replaces\nthe on-chain scripts, involving timelocks and hashlocks, on which “secret hash”\nswaps rely on. In other words, the secret and secret-hash in a HTLC swap (as\ndetailed in the first graph) have no immediate parallel in adaptor sig swaps.\nThis particularity of adaptor signature technology is why their implementations\nare sometimes referred to as “scriptless scripts” within the Bitcoin research\ncommunity.\n\nSince no such script is involved, the on-chain footprint is reduced, which has\nthe non-negligible advantage of making the atomic swap more lightweight, and\ntherefore cheaper.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to HTLCs where the same hash has to be used on each chain,\ntransactions involved in an atomic swap using adaptor signatures cannot be\nlinked. This, again, is particularly relevant to BasicSwap’s privacy\nconsiderations [https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/],\ngranted that at least one of the two coins involved in the cross-chain swaps\nfulfills the prerequisites mentioned in the second paragraph of this article.\n\nThe Path Ahead for BSX: Two-Way Adaptor Signature Setup\nBecause scripts are not possible on blockchains like XMR, there are currently\nconstraints on which coin can initiate a swap on BSX. To trade Monero for\nBitcoin, for example, only the BTC-owning side can *initiate* a transaction. \n\nYet, because advance planning can be done consistent with atomic swapping, it is\nconceptually possible for both sides to effectively originate a swap:\n\nIf I have XMR and want, say, BTC, one could simply post a desire to do a trade \nas their offer. The BTC owner could then initiate the current, more formal\nprocess, still risk free. This process can be automated and be all but invisible\nto the front-end user experience, and is a major and very exciting upcoming item\non the BSX roadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nTo Conclude…\nThe objective of this article is to provide a moderate but somewhat accessible\nunderstanding of why adaptor signature swaps can said to be a more private\nalternative to HTLC swaps, and how it protects swappers from any sort of\nmalicious passive observance by achieving the necessary smart contract logic for\nan atomic swap, without the use of on-chain script or hashed secrets. \n\nAs always, if you care about privacy as we do, we invite you to spread the word\nabout BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]’s\nongoing open beta.

First conceptualized in 2013 by <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765\">TierNolan on the Bitcointalk forums</a>, this first iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts), would need four more years to finally see the light of day.</p><p>Atomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside middleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic means they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and as such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and others.</p><p>In the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of swaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial agreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two parties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's own encrypted mixnet, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">SMSG network</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-original-hashed-time-lock-contract-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">The Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The first successful implementation of atomic swaps came <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">from the Decred project</a>, leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\", with the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic swap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as a \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.</p><p>Technically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound cryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first implementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a cryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract <strong>within a set timeframe</strong> (established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be returned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the transaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating blockchains to have both <strong>Hashlock </strong>and <strong>Timelock </strong>capabilities - a condition that leaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private Monero blockchain.</p><p>These two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:</p><p>A <strong>hashlock </strong>is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of funds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a cryptographic proof, in the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\">hash</a>).<br></p><p>A <strong>timelock </strong>is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific time (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs within a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not completed, without a need for a third party adjudicator.</p><p>The graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs:</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 600w, /glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 739w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: </p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and Ether) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a cryptographic hash function to generate hash, <em>h</em>. She then creates an HTLC contract using <em>h</em>, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed (spent) using the secret <em>s</em>, or they will be returned to her after a certain amount of time, <em>t</em>, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the other chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, <em>h</em>. Since Alice knows the original secret, <em>s</em>, which was used to produce the hash, <em>h</em>, she can redeem the Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret <em>s</em> to Bob, who can then take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.</p><p>Without diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a successful HTLC swap as described in the graph above,<strong> the \"secret hash\" involved in them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash swaps\"</strong>. For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in secret hash swaps is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">Decred atomic swap github page</a>.</p><h3 id=\"some-shortcomings-of-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">Some Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps</h3><p>Although they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of <strong>decentralized</strong> exchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic swap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place <strong>on-chain</strong>, which has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.</p><p>Whenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both blockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately sophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins involved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other, timestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is easily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from such an analysis, <strong>it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the identity of the participants involved</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"the-latest-adaptor-signature-scriptless-atomic-swaps\">The Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\" swaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept. 2020 paper titled <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126\">\"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"</a>. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf\">Lloyd Fournier’s work</a> on One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. <strong>Adaptor Signatures</strong>.</p><p>This type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it is impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a different method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by the non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that these prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap protocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style decentralized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output\">UTXO model</a>, and that have Segwit or a Segwit-equivalent <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability\">malleability fix</a>, such as Litecoin.</p><p>Those \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor signature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying math behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an <strong>additional </strong>signature that is combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor signatures enable two parties to reveal <strong>two pieces of data</strong> to each other simultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless protocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How Does It Work?</h3><p>This part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on the privacy distinctions between both swaps.</p><p>The graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on BSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case of BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png\" width=\"935\" height=\"1405\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png 600w, /glink/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png 935w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption>An \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.</figcaption></figure><p>In other words, adaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:</p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to exchange. Just like in the case of “secret hash” swaps, this is achieved in a private and decentralized way in BasicSwap via its distributed order book.</p><p>Note that a property of Monero is that <strong>the sum of public keys will match the public key for the sum of private keys</strong>. By sending XMR to the sum of the public keys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the HLTC protocol.</p><p><strong>The basic idea is:</strong></p><p>Alice and Bob each pick <strong>two secret (ECC) private keys</strong> (BTC and XMR), and swap one set of public keys with each other. Here, three different keys are involved for each side.</p><p>Alice sends a BTC transaction with an output to a multisig output, which requires a signature from both Alice and Bob in order to spend it. Once that occurs, Bob sees the BTC tx and sends the XMR tx to the XMR <strong>public key sum</strong>, as mentioned above.</p><p>Alice signs for her private key and encumbers that signature with Bob's xmr_public_key.</p><p>She sends that <strong>adaptor signature</strong> to Bob. This adaptor signature is not a transaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it does commit to a secret value (Alice’s private key).</p><p>Bob then decodes the adaptor signature with his xmr_private key and then signs for the BTC lock tx with his btc_private key.</p><p>As Bob now has a valid signature from Alice and himself, he can now spend from the locked BTC tx.</p><p>Alice watches the BTC chain for the tx that spends the lock tx.

with the creation of the \"first altcoin\", Litecoin, people have been\npondering and developing ways to swap their favorite digital assets without\nrelying on third-parties — the goal being an efficient, simple and private way\nto swap Bitcoin for Litecoin, or Monero, or any other cryptocurrency, that holds\nthe same values as a traditional P2P cryptocurrency transaction. The immediate\nproblem is that these cryptocurrencies generally reside on separate blockchains,\nwhich do not offer a lot of interoperability.\n\nDevelopers and tech entrepreneurs of all kinds have spotted this need in the\nmarket and went to work trying to bring to life a series of decentralized\ntrading exchanges — often abbreviated as \"DEX\".  This led to an increase in the\nnumber of DEXs and decentralized trading protocols which, in truth, really have\nlarge degrees of variation between them in terms of decentralization or even\nstraight up usability.\n\nOne thing that can be observed is that, even today with dozens upon dozens of\nDEXs, a substantial quantity of them focus exclusively on intra-chain swaps,\nmeaning swapping different assets belonging to the same chain together. Those\nare unfortunately very restricted in their swapping abilities, and do not fix\nthe underlying issues regarding important but perhaps more difficult to\nintegrate blockchains like Monero.\n\nCrossing the Chain Barrier\nTo many users, the details of how such cross-chain trades are accomplished under\nthe hood is not very much on their mind — and the distinction may even seem\nfutile. The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to\nbe able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the\nBinance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability\noffered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those\nusers’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional\nprivacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about\ndecentralization and privacy.\n\nThere is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many\nbold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are\nput forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is\ngenerally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty\nboth in terms of decentralization and of security.\n\nA common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or\n\"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed\nbe decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a wrapped asset on\nthe very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A wrapped asset is a token\non a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be\nmirroring.\n\nThe original asset is held, in custody, by a third-party which then issues a\ntoken worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian\nto its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it\nin exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your\ncoins”.\n\nUnfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (which has happened\nin the past\n[https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/]) there is\nabsolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly reverse\nor freeze your transactions\n[https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/] \nthemselves, or lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets\n[https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/]\n. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything\ndecentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnother common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with\nimportant challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains,\nor with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.\n\nThe Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs\nAtomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been first proposed\nin\n2013\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784]\n. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap\ncryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and\ncondition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo\none's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to\ntheir original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing\natomic swaps.\n\nBut even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to\nachieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely\ndifferent chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric\ncoins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private\nblockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly and decentralized\nalternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both,\nor deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic\nGUI.\n\nAtomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire\ntrue cross-chain operability on a bona fide exchange, and without giving in an\ninch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network,\nor layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is\nprecisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely\navailable between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.\n\nThat’s in major part what motivated us to build BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] — a \ncross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX. When you trade, say,\nBitcoin to Monero on the BasicSwap orderbook, no extensive node configuration is\nneeded, and absolutely no wrapping of assets takes place. We instead made true\ncross-chain swaps possible by combining two groundbreaking protocols; atomic\nswaps, and Particl’s own SMSG mixnet network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]SMSG: A layer\n2 Solution for Cross-Chain Interoperability\nBitcoin advocates often mention the role of cross-chain operability will be\nfilled by the Lightning Network. Years have passed and, although we are seeing\nnominal progress on that end, it is unfortunately very slow and still\ncomplicated to setup. But because the ability to swap cryptocurrencies with full\nprivacy is of dire need in this day and age, we’ve decided to take control of\nthings and build exactly a solution for that: BasicSwap.\n\nSecureMessaging (SMSG)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG],\na P2P messaging network inspired by BitMessage and developed by the particl.io\nteam, is what powers the BasicSwap DEX in place of the Lightning Network.\n\nIt acts as the required messaging layer for the accomplishment of BasicSwap’s\ntruly decentralized cross-chain DEX. SMSG is a simple message mixnet, where all\nnodes store a copy of everyone's end-to-end encrypted messages for a limited\nperiod of time. The sender of a message cannot exactly pinpoint the IP address\nof the receiver, because the messages defuse over the entire network.\n\nAll nodes attempt to decrypt every incoming message - if the HMAC\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC]check fails, then the message was either\nfraudulent or not addressed for you. This technology allowed us to successfully\nbuild a powerful and truly cross-chain DEX, that works using atomic swaps and \n'scriptless scripts'\n[https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/scriptless-scripts-schnorr].\n\nThis allows BasicSwap to relay vital atomic swap information from one chain to\nan entirely different one, even Monero, in a seamless and user-friendly manner\nand without coin wrapping, custodian entity, or any other centralized\nenvironment. This layer 2 acts as a powerful, entirely distributed bridge\nbetween chains that otherwise have nothing in common — an uncompromisingly\ndistributed alternative with incredible potential for easy-to-use third-party\nintegrations and contributions.\n\nTo learn more about BasicSwap, refer to this in-depth blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] or have a\nlook at its section on the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we stand today - trying to move the ball forward, always, towards a new\nera of decentralized cryptocurrency trading. An era where centralized,\ninstitutionalized, corporate “exchanges\" and the substantial security\nliabilities they involve are simply not needed anymore. An era where everyone is\nfree to trade whatever asset they want, efficiently and without third-parties.\n\nIf you want to help us build a freer world and more sane cryptocurrency trading\nconditions for all, we invite you to come test BasicSwap’s open beta, which goes\nlive imminently, and send us your feedback.

The immediate problem is that these cryptocurrencies generally reside on separate blockchains, which do not offer a lot of interoperability.</p><p>Developers and tech entrepreneurs of all kinds have spotted this need in the market and went to work trying to bring to life a series of decentralized trading exchanges — often abbreviated as \"DEX\".  This led to an increase in the number of DEXs and decentralized trading protocols which, in truth, really have large degrees of variation between them in terms of decentralization or even straight up usability.</p><p>One thing that can be observed is that, even today with dozens upon dozens of DEXs, a substantial quantity of them focus exclusively on intra-chain swaps, meaning swapping different assets belonging to the same chain together. Those are unfortunately very restricted in their swapping abilities, and do not fix the underlying issues regarding important but perhaps more difficult to integrate blockchains like Monero.</p><h2 id=\"crossing-the-chain-barrier\">Crossing the Chain Barrier</h2><p>To many users, the details of how such cross-chain trades are accomplished under the hood is not very much on their mind — and the distinction may even seem futile. The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to be able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the Binance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability offered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those users’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional privacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about decentralization and privacy.</p><p>There is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many bold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are put forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is generally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty both in terms of decentralization and of security.</p><p>A common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or \"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed be decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a <strong>wrapped asset</strong> on the very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A <strong>wrapped asset</strong> is a token on a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be mirroring.</p><p>The original asset is held, <strong>in custody</strong>, by a third-party which then issues a token worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian to its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it in exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your coins”.</p><p>Unfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (<a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/\">which has happened in the past</a>) there is absolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly<a href=\"https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/\"> reverse or freeze your transactions</a> themselves, or<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/\"> lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets</a>. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything decentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Another common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with important challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains, or with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.</p><h2 id=\"the-challenges-of-atomic-swaps-and-dexs\">The Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs</h2><p>Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784\">first proposed in 2013</a>. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap cryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and condition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo one's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to their original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing atomic swaps.</p><p>But even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to achieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely different chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric coins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private blockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly <em>and</em> decentralized alternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both, or deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic GUI.</p><p>Atomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire true cross-chain operability on a <em>bona fide</em> exchange, and without giving in an inch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network, or layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is precisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely available between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.</p><p>That’s in major part what motivated us to build <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap</a> — a <strong>cross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX</strong>.

and political organization -\nspecifically, about how blockchain-centric and privacy-centric organizations and\nprojects ought to be structured. \n\nWhile there are no one-size-fits-all answers, the powerful shakeup blockchain\ntechnologies brought to the internet means a lot more room for novel ideas of\norganization in this sphere. The advent of distributed autonomous organizations\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization] is a prime\nexample; while still in their early stages, DAOs lay the groundwork for\npolitical systems that are more compatible than ever with open-source products\nand services - especially truly disruptive, dissident applications of these new\ntechnologies.\n\nA decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), as we know, is a community made\nup of a multitude of participants, which functions according to the rules of\ngovernance inscribed in smart contracts as well as a democratic process of\nengagement. Management of those organizations is decentralized and democratic:\ndecisions that need to be made are made by stakeholders via an auditable,\ndistributed public vote. That is the case, for example, with the Particl\nprivacy-centric protocol, which concluded its latest development funding vote\nthis week [https://particl.news/team-funding-request-3-results/].\n\nSovereignty and Disruptive Technology\nPolitical thinker Carl Schmitt is well known for his articulation of the\n“Ausnahmezustand”, or “state of exception”, as well as its varied political\nimplications.\n\nSometimes defined as an emergency provision allowing a given government to\nsuspend the rule of law (such as martial law, or the french état de siège),\nSchmitt’s theory of Ausnahmezustand actually cuts deeper: at a deeper level,\nwhoever decides on this state of exception, or is in a position to deem it to\nexist and to remedy to it, can ultimately be defined as the “true sovereign\".\nAll other structures of power involved - whether it be a state government, a\nsupranational entity, or the governance of an organization such as Tornado Cash\n- ultimately fall under the remit of this “true sovereignty”. This has powerful,\nbroad implications; particularly on communities and projects that threaten the\ninterests, or even the existence, of genuinely sovereign power structures.\n\nOf course, a truly disruptive technology or service isn’t abstractly disruptive:\nit is disruptive with respect to a concrete power structure – oftentimes state\npower, endowed with powerful means to preserve its integrity. Such was the case\nwith the recent Tornado Cash debacle\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/08/crypto-mixing-service-tornado-cash-blacklisted-by-us-treasury/]\n, a crypto mixer that became so disruptive to American national interests as to\nforce the U.S. Treasury Department to flex some of its most powerful tools to\nnearly instantly crush it out of existence. One of its main developers, Alexey\nPertsev, was arrested, jailed, and even denied bail\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/24/alleged-tornado-developer-pertsev-must-stay-in-jail-dutch-judge-rules/] \nin the Netherlands, thousands of miles away from the White House. While it may\nbe too late for Tornado Cash to ever come back from this blow, several lessons\ncan be learned from this.\n\nMoving Forward: Divide AND Rule\nWhat can we learn of such a conditional governance, a governance that functions\nbecause it is allowed to? Ausnahmezustand, we can see, invokes a powerful\nparadox - but even Schmitt could not possibly have predicted the political\nrealities that offer themselves to us today.\n\nWhile still in their infancy, encrypted and truly distributed blockchain-era\ntechnologies — and the political structures they make possible — reveal\nthemselves as powerful alternatives to traditional governance. This is\nespecially true for organizations that threaten the power structures at work\nwithin the political spheres they are bound to; examples include dissident media\nentities, gray marketplace environments, currency exchange platforms, or even\nfile sharing platforms and protocols. For those rebels, distributed and\nanonymous decision making, file hosting and communications become shielded from\nthe potentially dire consequences of their resistance.\n\nWithout the unique aspects of DAOs - specifically its distributed nature, its\nprivate and pseudonymous aspects, and its utmost resistance to censorship - this\n“true sovereign” of any truly disruptive product or organization must by\ndefinition be unaccountable. This is because they either must be cloaked in\ntotal obscurity, being obligated to expertly hide themselves from power in order\nto subsist, or ultimately fall prey to the interests of higher powers.\nDistributed sovereignty, in this context, flips the old adage: divide AND rule,\nbut on the terms of the many instead of the few.\n\nDistributed Rule: A Future of Possibilities\nPrinciples of liberty, free access to information, freedom of association, and\nopen source technologies come together in such a radically distributed system of\ngovernance. With a lot of room to grow, decentralized autonomous organizational\nstructures have enormous potential to radically redefine the structuring of\neconomic activities and, at the same time, major economic, financial, and even\nlegal issues — the exploration of which has only just begun.\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about the revolutionary decentralized ecosystem we're\nbuilding at Particl, and if you want to contribute to the growth of online\nprivacy and liberties, then come join our awesome global community of\ncypherpunks on Discord [https://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n[https://t.me/particlOn], or Element\n[https://matrix.to/#/%23particl-project:matrix.org] — or just give one of our\ndecentralized and privacy-first apps a try here [https://particl.io/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?
