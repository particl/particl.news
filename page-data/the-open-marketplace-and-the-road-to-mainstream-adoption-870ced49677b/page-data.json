This release has been a historic moment for the project and\na huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is\nbrewing up.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?Since that time, the team has\ncertainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring\nthe community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of\nthis first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several\nfeatures that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s\nimportant to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an\nearly Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to\nthe contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the\nbiggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.\n\nIt’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on\nmainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas\nParticl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live\nproduct means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this\nproject has always been about building a product that people could use to\naddress real-world issues. It has always been about creating a solution that\nempowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And\nnow that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit\nfrom its groundbreaking technology.\n\nNow it’s Adoption Time!\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has\nreceived a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user\nexperience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the\nmarketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use\nParticl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”,\nor the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the\nmarketplace for the first time.\n\nIndeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but\nretaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are\nmore than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user\nexperience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first\nimpressions.\n\nFor this reason, the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be\nheavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as\ngood and as accessible as possible. In other words, each new marketplace feature\nreleased within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making\nthe user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and\nallowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.\n\nWhat are the Current Barriers to Entry\nSince the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and\nbusinesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current\nbarriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s\ncrucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.\n\nBy definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard\nto adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge,\ndifficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education\nabout a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry\nare mostly technological, financial, and educational.\n\nThat much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most\nreported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the\nmarketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it\ncan be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit\nchallenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most\nreported user experience issues include:\n\n * The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be\n   improved (technological barrier)\n * Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers (financial barrier)\n * The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides \n   (financial barrier)\n * There is no branding or identification option for vendors (technological\n   barrier)\n * The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other\n   cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment (technological\n   barrier)\n * The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few\n   minutes to do (technological barrier)\n * What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly\n   clear (educational barrier)\n * How funds move throughout a full transaction process (educational barrier)\n\nThese barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl\nto be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be\nprioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace\ndevelopment roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption\nof the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.\n\nMake Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace\nTo eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most\npeople, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements\nand features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly\ncontribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.\n\nWhat follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are\ngoing to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no\ndate or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s\nbeing worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short\nto mid-term.\n\n> Note: This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which\nfeatures will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to\nchange.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming Up for Particl?\n * User Interface Tweaks\n * Lowering Marketplace Fees\n * Product Import Tool (1)\n * Q&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller (2)\n * Particl Desktop Settings Page (3)\n * Market Management Tool (4)\n * Adjustable Escrow Ratio (5)\n * Inventory and Quantity Management Tool (6)\n * Then What?\n   Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\n   Mobile Application\n   Developer SDK Tools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Interface Tweaks\nImproved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)The lowest hanging fruit for\nimpoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user\ninterface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is\nhosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and\nwill make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in\nthe past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to\nbuyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client\n(i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction\nbeen locked into escrow, and etc).\n\nLowering Marketplace Fees\nOne of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing\nan item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any\nthird-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or\nescrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off\nspam on the network.\n\nIn fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few\ncents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any\nseller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the\nfact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up\nfor some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers\nwith huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman AppFortunately, you can\nactually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. The Particl team has\npublished on their blog a full tutorial\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601] on how to instruct\nyour staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network.\nSMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and\nhosted.\n\nAdditionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the\nSMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will\nsignificantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.\n\nThese changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the\nmarketplace as updates get pushed.\n\nProduct Import Tool\nProduct Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)One of the key components of a two-sided\nmarketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why\nthe new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot\nof tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.\n\nOne such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly\nimport large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it\ntakes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories.\nWithout this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is\na very time-consuming process.\n\nWith this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list\nlarge inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory\nimportation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More\noptions are very likely to be added in the future.\n\nQ&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller\nBut a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good\namount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the\nupcoming Q&A section comes into play.\n\nThis “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before\npurchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&A\nsection that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into\ngiving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.\n\nThis feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help\nbuyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more\nconfidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the\nbetter decisions one can make.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nThe Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to\nchange a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify\nsome config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since\nthe goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s\ndefinitely not as user-friendly as it should be.\n\nThe Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It\nallows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle\nof finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of\ncommands to enter in the console.\n\nMarket Management Tool\nThe Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open\nMarketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual\npieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed\nnetwork of markets.\n\nSelect What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)Market Management\nwill allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a\npre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are\ncompletely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact,\nthey are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data\ncan be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more\nadvanced and for markets.\n\nOn Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.\n\nCommunity Markets: They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can\nbuy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main\ninterface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over\nother users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not\nenabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect\nyour Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.\n\n> Note: The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s\nenabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.\nJoined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts: They are customizable community markets on which special\npermissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they\nare storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only\nhim (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings.\nAnyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on\nthere by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by\ncommunities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers\ncould publish listings.\n\n> Note: By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on\nthe network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people\nto interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts\nget promoted.\nPromote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)While Particl Desktop cannot\nautomatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to promote\nyour market to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or\nstorefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market\nto the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected\nto the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a\nmarket will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for\nthe amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the\nmarket disappears from the market browser.\n\n> Note: Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is\nstill accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it\nwon’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.\nAnyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All\nthe fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees,\nredistributed to stakers.\n\nCreate a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts are ideal for\nsellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to\ntheir customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of\nit, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the\nMarket ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.\n\nAdditionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding\n(logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a\nvendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for\ncustomers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Ratio\nAs it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works\nusing a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit\nequal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s\nnothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the\nbest game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some\ncircumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.\n\nTake the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer\nbase and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of\nits inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for\nhis business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already\nwell-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both\nthe seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit\nMAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established\nbetween the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront,\nhe can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his\nMarket ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required\nsecurity deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the\nbuyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for\ntransactions.\n\nWhat an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own\nescrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known\nseller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to\n0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the\nvendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a\ndishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing\ncustomer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the\nescrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a\nno-brainer.\n\nInventory and Quantity Management Tool\nThis feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide\ninventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace\nback-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the\nOpen Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is\nstill needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the\nMarket Management tool.\n\nThis tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory\nquantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import\ntool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large\ninventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being\na big hassle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen What?\nAll of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap,\nmeaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months,\ndepending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!\n\nThe Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing\nresearch on the features that are going to be worked on once the above\nmarketplace development roadmap is completed.\n\nAlternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\nOne of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it\nonly works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to\nthe nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use PART for its\nprivacy and smart-contract capabilities\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]. If it\nwere using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time\ndue to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a\nprivate-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it\nwould be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used\nwithin smart-contracts. The PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that\nhas\nboth a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] which\nallows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s\npretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the\nlimitations.\n\nBut in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user\nexperience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that\ncan be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address\nthis issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative\nmethods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.\n\nThere are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap\nwidget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would\nlike to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is\nongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded\nin until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to\ngo. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically,\nand so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.\n\nIt’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept\ndifferent payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles\nthe transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open\nMarketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to\noperate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract\ncapabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted\ninto a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end\nresult is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all\nthe rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.\n\nMobile Application\nAnother very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile\napplication. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means\ndownloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain +\nSMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides\nway better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak\nof an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.\n\nAnd so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of\na mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very\nmoment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because\nthere are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the\nabove roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping\neverything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or\nnear-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to\nbecome more of a focus.\n\nThis mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever\nbeen. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now\nspend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the\napplication has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a\n“light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain\nand SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be\nas easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s\napplication).\n\nDeveloper SDK Tools\nWith bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has\nplanned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various\ntechnical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside\ndevelopers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by\ndeveloping services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.\n\nBecause the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase,\nthis SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the\nday. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code\ngets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write\ndocumentation on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Wrap it Up\nAll of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have\none thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the\nOpen Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all\ncontribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting\nParticl more complicated for most people.\n\nOnce in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much\nmore credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl\npioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving\na trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the\nmarketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be\nexpected to come out at an accelerated pace!\n\nParticl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The\ndevelopment team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new\nphase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about\nputting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting\nand when it starts moving faster!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &amp; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to change.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"what-s-coming-up-for-particl\">What’s Coming Up for Particl?</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#8c5a\"><strong>User Interface Tweaks</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#5f27\"><strong>Lowering Marketplace Fees</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#909d\"><strong>Product Import Tool</strong></a><strong> (1)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d73\"><strong>Q&amp;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</strong></a><strong> (2)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#c8cb\"><strong>Particl Desktop Settings Page</strong></a><strong> (3)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#7168\"><strong>Market Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (4)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#e90f\"><strong>Adjustable Escrow Ratio</strong></a><strong> (5)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d2b\"><strong>Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (6)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#5a71\"><strong>Then What?</strong></a><br><a href=\"#a7e1\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</a><br><a href=\"#c75e\">Mobile Application</a><br><a href=\"#9733\">Developer SDK Tools</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"user-interface-tweaks\">User Interface Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-ZdZYzwxy3xJGIyMnGSbIwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Improved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>The lowest hanging fruit for impoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is hosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and will make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in the past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to buyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client (i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction been locked into escrow, and etc).</p><h3 id=\"lowering-marketplace-fees\">Lowering Marketplace Fees</h3><p>One of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing an item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any third-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or escrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off spam on the network.</p><p>In fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few cents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network. SMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and hosted.</p><p>Additionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the SMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will significantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.</p><p>These changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the marketplace as updates get pushed.</p><h3 id=\"product-import-tool\">Product Import Tool</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-nV8MXWfbGAStemdjRDT_EQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Product Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the key components of a two-sided marketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory importation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&amp;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&amp;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&amp;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"994d687a-0700-42af-9230-d514c67d48e9","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767b2","reading_time":16,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &#x26; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet.

These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and will make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in the past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to buyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client (i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction been locked into escrow, and etc).</p><h3 id=\"lowering-marketplace-fees\">Lowering Marketplace Fees</h3><p>One of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing an item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any third-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or escrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off spam on the network.</p><p>In fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few cents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network. SMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and hosted.</p><p>Additionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the SMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will significantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.</p><p>These changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the marketplace as updates get pushed.</p><h3 id=\"product-import-tool\">Product Import Tool</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-nV8MXWfbGAStemdjRDT_EQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Product Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the key components of a two-sided marketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory importation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&#x26;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&#x26;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"New Marketplace Development Update & Roadmap"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
