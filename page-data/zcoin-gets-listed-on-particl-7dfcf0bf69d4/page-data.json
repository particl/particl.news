Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick.\n\nParticl MarketplaceDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nTogether’s Better\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle. Particl also natively protects your online identity,\nsecure your communications, doesn’t collect or even generate any metadata about\nyou, and lets you hide your network identity (IP address).

This includes shirts, caps,\nhoodies, and some very special mugs.\n\nFor the occasion, there are some pretty sweet but time-limited deals going on!\nFirst come, first serve, so make sure to hurry up!\n\n * First 20 shirts are 1 PART, the next 80 shirts will only be $5\n * First 10 hoodies are 1 PART, the next 20 hoodies will only be $5\n * First 20 mugs are 1 PART, the next 40 mugs will only be $5\n\n> Get them while the deal lasts!\nA Perfect Match for Privacy Nuts\nThe most interesting aspect of topping up your Particl account using Zcoin is\nthe compounding effect gained from combining different privacy protocols\ntogether. Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick\n[https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c].\n\nDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nBetter Together\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle. Particl also natively protects your online identity,\nsecure your communications, doesn’t collect or even generate any metadata about\nyou, and lets you hide your network identity (IP address).

It is the first to develop and implement the Sigma Protocol, which\nallows users to have complete privacy over their transactions via zero-knowledge\ncryptographic proofs without the need for trusted setup. Its research labs also\ncreated the Lelantus privacy protocol which has gained academic acclaim and set\nto go live on Zcoin in 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Zcoin made history by having the Thai Democrat Party’s elections held\non its blockchain with over 127,000 votes cast nationwide.\n\nAbout Particl\nParticl is a privacy-first and worldwide censorship-resistant eCommerce platform\nbuilt on blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. It restores the balance of\npower towards the individual, not corporations or authorities, by decentralizing\ncore aspects of today’s internet and economy.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and reliable multi-vendor marketplace\nthat lets anyone in the world buy and sell anything, without leaving a trace. It\neliminates the problems of trust, personal data abuse, and enrichment of large\ncorporations. It preserves privacy at any time and enables a trading scope for\nunbeatable product pricing. Free of any third-party interference, it creates a\nfair level playing field.\n\nThe Particl coin (PART) is the native currency of the Particl Marketplace. It is\na privacy coin that offers strong but flexible data protection and privacy\ncapabilities using a combination of the Confidential Transactions (CT) and\nRingCT (with Bulletproofs) privacy protocols. It is the first coin built on the\nBitcoin codebase to ever make these protocols available.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn More About Particl\n * What to expect in Particl V3.0\n   [https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n * All about Particl’s fundamentals\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/ffbzfw/particl_chart_prior_to_its_massive_update/]\n * Complete collection of useful links\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/pxu0py/getting_started/]\n * Join the community on Telegram [https://t.me/ParticlOn]\n * Join the community on Discord [https://discord.me/particl]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/1-w3OMndBq3t132yt3_iMkDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-way-to-shop-online\">The World’s Most Private Way to Shop Online</h3><p><strong>Zcoin</strong> has been added to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application as of this <strong>6th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC</strong>.

Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can significantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with <a href=\"https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c\"><strong>this simple trick</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"different-approaches-to-privacy\">Different Approaches to Privacy</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-ol1PadCGMr0x-hDg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Zcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and anonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.</p><p>Zcoin uses what is known as <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>SIGMA</strong></a> and will soon move to its evolved version — <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>Lelantus</strong></a>.<strong> </strong>It is a zero-knowledge protocol that basically <strong>burns coins</strong> and <strong>redeems them</strong> at some later point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows direct anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else. This privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.</p><p>Particl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>RingCT</strong></a> to <strong>mix coins</strong> with others and uses “<strong>decoys</strong>” to obfuscate the payment trail even more. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace transactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but also credible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\">plausible deniability</a>.</p><p>Both of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons. For example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively but Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its marketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind of technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why not mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?</p><h3 id=\"better-together\">Better Together</h3><p>With just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy protocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-qYgCKKNSqU9R8obf.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network, redeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl Desktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking out your cart on the Particl Marketplace.</p><p><strong>Simply follow these steps:</strong></p><ul><li>On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.</li><li>Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added privacy)</li><li>Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap</li><li>Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance</li><li>Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)</li></ul><p>Following this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when shopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the Particl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.</p><p>Since both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day exploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one protocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one step of the giant puzzle.

The Particl team is also opening up a \nvoluntary donation address for community members to support outreach\ninitiatives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Marketplace for Everyone\nCryptocurrency communities tend to be tribal by nature, but Particl has always\nstrived to be a project building solutions that everybody can benefit from. It’s\nin the project’s DNA. As such, Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop\nclient is designed to be able to accept a multitude of payment options, not just\nits native coin (PART).\n\nThe rationale for this inclusive approach is simple\n[https://particl.news/bitcoin-particl-building-an-independent-economy-together-b293e214a094]\n—privacy, security, reliability, and being able to buy and sell anything online \nwithout censorship, restrictions, interference, nor fees, should be made easily\navailable to everyone in the world and not be exclusive to one community only.\nThe technology exists and has been live for a while, what good would it do and\nwhat societal progress would it really trigger if it’s kept exclusive to a\nselect group of individuals?\n\nBitcoin Accepted Here\nWith this in mind, Particl added the ability to make Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] as\npart of Particl’s marketplace checkout process and as a standalone swap engine\nin December 2019. This allowed anyone possessing Bitcoin to spend it anonymously\nand buy anything available on the marketplace using the world’s most popular\ncryptocurrency. No more third-party Bitcoin payment processors required at all,\nno more data harvesting, no more restrictions or censorship, and no more\ntransaction fees!\n\nOf course, Particl’s inclusive approach is much more ambitious than simply\naccepting Bitcoin! Anything from fiat forms of payments to other\ncryptocurrencies are intended goals that are meant to be achieved by Particl. A\nmulti-purpose tool called “Particl bots” were invented for this specific purpose\n—they are little middle-ware programs that interact with the Particl network and\nprovide opt-in third-party services (i.e. swap/exchange services).\n\nThe Particl team planned on adding many new coins in its next release, but since\nit ended up taking a bit longer than anticipated, and for very good reasons\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n, the decision was made to act right away before the Particl Desktop 3.0 release \nand provide the marketplace with an immediate added value.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Coins Coming in Just a Few Days\nThe Particl team is excited to announce that, starting in just a few days, new\ncoins will be added to Particl Desktop. This will allow you to buy anything with\nthem on the Particl marketplace or simply swap them for PART straight from the\nclient.\n\nThe first two coins that are going to be added will be DAI\n[https://makerdao.com/en/], the stablecoin from the MakerDAO team, and Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/], a leading privacy coin with a solid but different privacy\nprotocol than Particl’s!\n\nNew Benefits Unlocked\nOn one hand, adding these two coins instantly provides the marketplace with a \nbig boost in accessibility and usability. On the other hand, it allows more\npeople than ever to be able to use the marketplace without breaking a sweat\nsimply by spending their favorite digital currency! And that’s all possible\nwithout having to manually swap DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] or Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/] for PART on an exchange first. It’s done straight from the\nParticl wallet.\n\nSo whether you’re a stablecoin holder that just wants to live off the economical\ngrid, or whether you’re more interested in the privacy aspect of\ncryptocurrencies and want to take things a step further by mixing privacy\nprotocols together, that will all be possible in just a few days. Particl’s\nrange of use-cases just got way bigger!\n\nAn Important Note on Transaction Settlements\nAlthough Particl will start listing new coins on its platform, it needs to be\npointed out that all marketplace transactions are meant to be settled in PART.\nThis provides the privacy aspects of the marketplace and the ability to use its\ntwo-party escrow system\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-double-deposit-mad-escrow-b3699dd29768].\n\nFor this reason, any currency added to Particl needs to be swapped into PART\nbefore concluding a marketplace transaction. This is possible by either using\nthe standalone swapping module included in Particl Desktop before making an\nonline purchase or by simply swapping coins as part of the checkout process once\nyou’re ready to pay for your shopping cart.\n\nIn other words, any non-PART transaction is ultimately settled, in full, as a\nPART transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDonations Can Bring Particl a Long Way\nWould you like to be PART of Particl’s success? The Particl team is opening a \ndonation deposit address to help fund outreach initiatives related to the\nlisting of new coins. Funds will be used for various initiatives such as\ncreating and giving away free custom merchandise and goodies, run contests,\ngiveaways, and other similar promotional efforts.\n\nMaybe you have a great idea on how to improve Particl’s exposure as new coins\nget added?

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
