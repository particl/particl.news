No payment processor, no marketplace operator,\nno bank, no moderator, no data miner, no nothing. Just you, the person you’re\ntransacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent\nscams.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2This total absence of\nthird-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening\nup a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that \nfor-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on\nthe internet. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is\nno one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental,\nespecially when you consider that online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up\nto even 50% for the services they offer. A fee that is naturally reflected in\nthe retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.\n\nAnd more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer\neCommerce in a totally private and anonymous way. In fact, a mix of\nprivacy-preserving protocols such as RingCT, CT, stealth addresses, Tor,\nrock-solid encryption, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of\ndigital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!\n\n> Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIts Evolution Since it Launched\nThe Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its\ninitial mainnet release on the 12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0).\nThese releases have seen the addition of several important features and a\nsignificant improvement in all components.\n\nHere are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace\nsince its release:\n\n * Questions and answers on listings\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Product/inventory import\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Bitcoin payments\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * Bid cancellation\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Listing fee reduction\n   [https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601]\n * Settings [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Many UI/UX improvements\n * Many marketplace codebase improvements\n * Many bug fixes\n\nThere is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/] since its mainnet release. It’s been\nsignificantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch\nof new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.\n\nA Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application\nSince the release of Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] on\nParticl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been\nworking on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —Multi-Markets\n, or “Infinite Markets” as referenced by some in the community.\n\n> Multi-Markets in a NutshellMulti-Markets add the ability to create and join an\ninfinite number of user-created markets and storefronts on the Particl network.\nIt essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide\nnetwork of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/].\n\nInitially, Particl Desktop 2.4.0 was only intended to add the ability to create\nor join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new\nfeature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it turned into a great\nopportunity to make a major leap forward and as a result, became much bigger\nthan anticipated. Here’s why…\n\nRe-Writing Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels\ngood, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto\nwallet. As proof, it has often been forked and adapted by other open-source\nprojects to serve as the main desktop wallet.\n\nBut it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is\nalready almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience\nand knowledge since then.\n\nIt may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of\nthe marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against\nsome of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such\nas multi-markets.\n\nAnd so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both\nthe marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided\nto completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.\n\nAs such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase\nhave been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more\nmodern codebase.\n\nThis is why the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl\nDesktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.\n\nAdding More Features Than Initially Planned\nPreview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0Along the\nway of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of\nthe marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into\nthe new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit,\nbut would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the\nintegration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the\nteam chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.\n\nFor this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer\nthan initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the\nopportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of\ndecentralized online commerce.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0\nParticl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is\ncoming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire\nback-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is,\nquite literally, Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch almost three\nyears ago.\n\nHere are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:\n\nParticl Desktop\n * A much lighter, faster, more responsive and modern desktop application\n * A modular approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine\n   into different and independent modules\n * All modules (including marketplace) enabled by default on first startup\n * Massively improved user interface and user experience, more intuitive and \n   user-friendly\n * An almost uncountable number of bug fixes, improvements, and tweaks to most\n   components of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl\n   community for the valuable feedback ❤ )\n * A complete overhaul of the in-app swap engine interface\n * SDK friendly desktop application\n\nMarketplace Improvements\n * Addition of a brand new marketplace user dashboard with advanced\n   notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account\n * Addition of multi-markets and the ability to create an infinity of markets\n   and storefronts\n * Addition of the Market Browser and the ability to browse and join any\n   user-created market or storefront. It’s also possible to promote markets in\n   the Market Browser.\n * Improvements to Question and Answers section of listings — easier access and\n   more comprehensive notifications\n * Addition of user identities and profiles\n * Addition of custom categories which can be set per market or storefront\n * Massive reduction in listing fees, will be reduced by more than 80% of\n   current cost. The cost of listing a product on Particl will then be well\n   under a cent worth of PART\n * Improvements to how Particl Desktop, the marketplace codebase, and the SMSG\n   network interact with each other\n\n> Note: Because the V2 and V3 versions of Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nso radically different, listings won’t be compatible with each other’s version.\nIn other words, listings published on V3 won’t show up on V2, and vice-versa. Of\ncourse, it’s always possible to revert back to a V2 version of the marketplace\nto complete any outstanding order you may still have.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore to Come After the V3 Release\nThe V3 version of Particl will mark a significant step in Particl’s roadmap\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/] as it will cross off many of its items. It will\nalso serve as the trigger for many other initiatives to come to life.\n\nNew Coins to be Added\nOverhaul of the in-App Swap Engine Interface (Particl Desktop V3)After Particl\nDesktop 3.0 goes live, more cryptocurrencies will be added to the in-app swap\nengine. This will be the best time to show the world what Particl has been up to\nin the last few months and come out with a bang in various cryptocurrency\ncommunities.\n\nEncrypted Messaging System\nCurrently under development by DeMarkets.io [https://demarkets.io/], a\ncompletely distributed, private, and encrypted messaging system will allow you\nto communicate with anyone else in the world. Whether that person is a buyer,\nseller, or just a friend, you’ll be able to exchange secure messages on the\nParticl network. Thanks to all the developers at DeMarkets.io\n[http://DeMarkets.io] for the work they’re putting into this decentralized chat\nsystem! ❤\n\nParticl Academy\nThe Particl Academy is going to be Particl’s main informative hub, the\ninteractive user manual. It contains all the basic information and instructions\nrequired to use Particl to its full extent. It’s also written in a way that\nanyone can understand and is meant to make onboarding new users a much easier\ntask.\n\nVendor Onboarding and Outreach Program\nThe Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program (VOP) is a program designed to help\nmake the process of onboarding new sellers easier and help them make their first\nsteps in the world of decentralized eCommerce. It also provides all the tools\nrequired for anyone to actively participate in reaching out and getting new\nsellers to join Particl.\n\nTo help and support new sellers, the VOP will provide added benefits and perks\nto sellers who opt to register to the program. These include the funding of\nlisting fees, the promotion of markets and storefronts, access to VIP channels,\npersonalized support, more exposure within Particl’s community, and many more\nbenefits. It also provides marketing and informational content to the community\nso that anyone can go out there and find new vendors!\n\nNew Community Voting Mechanism\nThe Partyman cold staking application has recently been updated with some new\nvoting capabilities. This voting system is more private and robust compared to\nthe in-app Proposals system. More details about how to use the voting system and\nhow it will be used to manage the Community Fund will be revealed here on \nParticl.news [http://particl.news] soon.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are still a few weeks separating us from the first Particl Desktop 3.0\nrelease, but it will be well worth the wait!

Just you, the person you’re transacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent scams.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-wDUfOyGBvwgQJyvqAVovFg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2</figcaption></figure><p>This total absence of third-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening up a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that <strong>for-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on the internet</strong>. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is no one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental, especially when you consider that <strong>online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up to even 50% for the services they offer</strong>. A fee that is naturally reflected in the retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.</p><p>And more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer eCommerce in a <strong>totally private and anonymous</strong> way. In fact, a mix of privacy-preserving protocols such as <strong>RingCT</strong>, <strong>CT</strong>, <strong>stealth addresses</strong>, <strong>Tor</strong>, rock-solid <strong>encryption</strong>, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of digital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

These releases have seen the addition of several important features and a significant improvement in all components.</p><p>Here are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace since its release:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Questions and answers on listings</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Product/inventory import</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Bid cancellation</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>Listing fee reduction</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Settings</strong></a></li><li>Many UI/UX improvements</li><li>Many marketplace codebase improvements</li><li>Many bug fixes</li></ul><p>There is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a><strong> </strong>since its mainnet release.

It essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide network of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a>.<br></blockquote><p>Initially, <strong>Particl Desktop 2.4.0</strong> was only intended to add the ability to create or join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new feature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it <strong>turned into a great opportunity to make a major leap forward</strong> and as a result, became much bigger than anticipated.

The Particl team is also opening up a \nvoluntary donation address for community members to support outreach\ninitiatives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Marketplace for Everyone\nCryptocurrency communities tend to be tribal by nature, but Particl has always\nstrived to be a project building solutions that everybody can benefit from. It’s\nin the project’s DNA. As such, Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop\nclient is designed to be able to accept a multitude of payment options, not just\nits native coin (PART).\n\nThe rationale for this inclusive approach is simple\n[https://particl.news/bitcoin-particl-building-an-independent-economy-together-b293e214a094]\n—privacy, security, reliability, and being able to buy and sell anything online \nwithout censorship, restrictions, interference, nor fees, should be made easily\navailable to everyone in the world and not be exclusive to one community only.\nThe technology exists and has been live for a while, what good would it do and\nwhat societal progress would it really trigger if it’s kept exclusive to a\nselect group of individuals?\n\nBitcoin Accepted Here\nWith this in mind, Particl added the ability to make Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] as\npart of Particl’s marketplace checkout process and as a standalone swap engine\nin December 2019. This allowed anyone possessing Bitcoin to spend it anonymously\nand buy anything available on the marketplace using the world’s most popular\ncryptocurrency. No more third-party Bitcoin payment processors required at all,\nno more data harvesting, no more restrictions or censorship, and no more\ntransaction fees!\n\nOf course, Particl’s inclusive approach is much more ambitious than simply\naccepting Bitcoin! Anything from fiat forms of payments to other\ncryptocurrencies are intended goals that are meant to be achieved by Particl. A\nmulti-purpose tool called “Particl bots” were invented for this specific purpose\n—they are little middle-ware programs that interact with the Particl network and\nprovide opt-in third-party services (i.e. swap/exchange services).\n\nThe Particl team planned on adding many new coins in its next release, but since\nit ended up taking a bit longer than anticipated, and for very good reasons\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n, the decision was made to act right away before the Particl Desktop 3.0 release \nand provide the marketplace with an immediate added value.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Coins Coming in Just a Few Days\nThe Particl team is excited to announce that, starting in just a few days, new\ncoins will be added to Particl Desktop. This will allow you to buy anything with\nthem on the Particl marketplace or simply swap them for PART straight from the\nclient.\n\nThe first two coins that are going to be added will be DAI\n[https://makerdao.com/en/], the stablecoin from the MakerDAO team, and Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/], a leading privacy coin with a solid but different privacy\nprotocol than Particl’s!\n\nNew Benefits Unlocked\nOn one hand, adding these two coins instantly provides the marketplace with a \nbig boost in accessibility and usability. On the other hand, it allows more\npeople than ever to be able to use the marketplace without breaking a sweat\nsimply by spending their favorite digital currency! And that’s all possible\nwithout having to manually swap DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] or Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/] for PART on an exchange first. It’s done straight from the\nParticl wallet.\n\nSo whether you’re a stablecoin holder that just wants to live off the economical\ngrid, or whether you’re more interested in the privacy aspect of\ncryptocurrencies and want to take things a step further by mixing privacy\nprotocols together, that will all be possible in just a few days. Particl’s\nrange of use-cases just got way bigger!\n\nAn Important Note on Transaction Settlements\nAlthough Particl will start listing new coins on its platform, it needs to be\npointed out that all marketplace transactions are meant to be settled in PART.\nThis provides the privacy aspects of the marketplace and the ability to use its\ntwo-party escrow system\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-double-deposit-mad-escrow-b3699dd29768].\n\nFor this reason, any currency added to Particl needs to be swapped into PART\nbefore concluding a marketplace transaction. This is possible by either using\nthe standalone swapping module included in Particl Desktop before making an\nonline purchase or by simply swapping coins as part of the checkout process once\nyou’re ready to pay for your shopping cart.\n\nIn other words, any non-PART transaction is ultimately settled, in full, as a\nPART transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDonations Can Bring Particl a Long Way\nWould you like to be PART of Particl’s success? The Particl team is opening a \ndonation deposit address to help fund outreach initiatives related to the\nlisting of new coins. Funds will be used for various initiatives such as\ncreating and giving away free custom merchandise and goodies, run contests,\ngiveaways, and other similar promotional efforts.\n\nMaybe you have a great idea on how to improve Particl’s exposure as new coins\nget added? If that’s the case, then join our Telegram [https://t.me/ParticlOn] \nor Discord [https://discord.me/particl] community right away and take part in\nthe discussion!\n\n> Outreach donation address (public): PYwXDHE8B9zTaeTxy95i8z7L9MfaQpzKWe\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/PYwXDHE8B9zTaeTxy95i8z7L9MfaQpzKWe]\nOutreach donation address (private): \nSPH3GootfeBkwfTFxpRCDQaZaMLRJSsXfNdJrpM3u2WEduY8CndEy8HvdySeN7NnJdwJ2iYBt5f1S1arMnKbr8i6MYMLf4qSq5Xjdn\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Coin Would You Want to See on Particl?\nWith this, Particl is getting more accessible and more approachable than it has\never been. Don’t forget, adding DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] and Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/] is only a beginning, but it provides instant added value to\nthe marketplace and these coins as well.\n\nWhat coins would you like to see next? Are you a fan of a particular crypto\ncommunity and would love to use your favorite coin on Particl? Then let the team\nknow by filling the listing application form which that will appear on Particl’s\nwebsite next week or by talking about it in the Particl community.

making good progress in\nbuilding and improving on the marketplace as well as adding a ton of\nfunctionalities. It’s safe to say, this new revamped marketplace is bound to\nimpress more than a few heads. Not only will it look much better and be a lot\neasier to use, but it’s performance will also feel like day and night for anyone\nthat has used the marketplace before.\n\nHere is the latest development report from Development Manager Henk Swardt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\n * As most of you are already aware now, a new version of Particl Desktop\n   (2.3.3.) was released a short while ago. This introduced a slightly updated\n   marketplace codebase in order to address a bug experienced in the buyflow\n   when using Particl Core 0.19. While the update and change went well, some\n   problems were encountered during the signing and notarizing of the Mac\n   builds, which delayed the release a little. This, unfortunately, took some\n   time to fix and get working again, but eventually got sorted and we were able\n   to release the builds.\n * The basics of the re-implementation of the listing details view (effectively\n   the modal that is displayed when clicking on a listing) into Particl Desktop\n   has been completed. We’re now using this specific modal in more places now in\n   order to provide details on a particular listing or order wherever it may be\n   necessary to do so. For example, it is now displayed during the buyflow when\n   needing to look over the details of the item ordered without having to jump\n   off the page. This is a common behaviour for most online marketplaces and\n   will now be part of Particl as well.\n * After some discussions and testing around the creation and display of product\n   templates, as well as the publishing of them into marketplace listings, there\n   was a need to modify and re-work some aspects of the way this was being done\n   in the new ‘Sell’ section of the market module in the Particl Desktop. This\n   re-work is currently in progress.\n * A new “Inventory & Products” tab in the ‘Sell’ section has been added. This\n   will act as a central place for your products in stock (which effectively\n   means splitting the Sell > Listings tab into two separate ones).\n * Due to the integration of “infinite markets” and necessary for it, you can\n   now see which inventory items are published on which markets and storefronts.\n   This will also help with Quantity Management in the future, one of Particl’s\n   current roadmap items.\n * A new batch publish feature for pushing created/imported inventory items\n   (Products) on the marketplace is currently being worked on.\n * The “Import Listings” section of Particl Desktop has now become “Import\n   Products” and has been significantly redesigned to be easier to use.\n * The interface and usability of the escrow process and Market modals for\n   pushing Orders to next their next stages (ie. Accept bid, Mark as delivered,\n   etc.) has been redesigned.\n * The Market Overview page has been redesigned to work more as a guidepost or\n   dashboard for a quick overview of the latest activity that has happened since\n   the last visit — clicking on a card will take you directly to the relevant\n   place.\n * The Questions and Answers layout has been globally redesigned and reused at\n   multiple places for easier access (i.e. directly in a Listing’s details and\n   in a dedicated Sell/Buy > Questions & Answers tab).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSneak Peeks\nTo better illustrate some of the changes currently being worked on, here are\nsome live screenshots taken from the latest internal builds. Please keep in mind\neverything showed here is still a work in progress and subject to change before\nthe release.\n\nMarket’s Overview Page\nThe Market’s Overview page will now act as a guidepost or dashboard for getting\na quick but detailed overview of all actions requiring your attention.\n\nReworked Exchange Module\nParticl Desktop’s in-app swap section has been fully isolated from other modules\nand now acts as its own independent module. Coins and exchanges displayed in\nthis screenshot are not announcements of any sort but rather a good\ndemonstration of where this module is headed UI/UX-wise.\n\nQuestions and Answers\nAs mentioned in the Progress Report of this Development Update, the Q/A\nfunctionality has now been integrated into additional pages for easier access.\nUsers will now be notified whenever they receive a new question or answer to a\nlisting and will be able to navigate to it without much hassle.\n\nMarket Settings\nThe Market Settings page allows you to manage market-related settings. As more\nfeatures and functionalities get added to the marketplace moving forward, here\nis where you’ll be able to tweak their settings as well as your preferences.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--05-06-2020-/1-DDaMGsjP5VvVlMaj3HTYQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For the past few weeks, the Particl developers have been making good progress in building and improving on the marketplace as well as adding a ton of functionalities.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks.

The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further.

This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
