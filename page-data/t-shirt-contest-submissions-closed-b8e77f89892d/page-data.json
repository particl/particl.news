livestream [https://youtu.be/7DNm9l3GmRs],\nand here is a more complete look at what the Particl development team will be\nworking towards for the upcoming 6 months and beyond. \nhttps://particl.io/roadmap/\n\nThe following items are all in our 2018–2019 pipeline. We’ve identified\nimportant items that are focus features over the next 6 months and beyond but\naren’t tying these to quarters as we did in our Roadmap v1.2\n[https://particl.news/project-update-november-8th-2017-c0437292e1f8].\n\n*New items can be added or taken away at anytime, this is a living document.\n\nIN PROGRESS:\nWith the release\n[https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-0-1-1dad242b075] of Particl Core\n0.16.0.1 the development team debuts a couple features that they have been\nworking on.\n\nSupport for Hardware Signing Devices\nParticl Core 0.16 introduces generic support for Hardware Signing Devices to\nprovide key-signing capabilities.\n\nLedger Integration\nInitial support for the Ledger Hardware Wallet is here!\n\nThis has not yet been extended to blind or anon tranactions and therefore\ncurrently cannot be used exclusively for all functions of the wallet. Support\nwill continue to be extended in future versions.\n\nStealth Addresses V2\nIn order to facilitate deterministic generation of stealth addresses between\nParticl Core and Signing Devices the method used to generate these addresses had\nto be changed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Marketplace (MP)\nThe majority of our team will be focused on the private decentralized\nmarketplace over the next 6 months. We are readying our Alpha release of the\nParticl Marketplace as I write this.\n\nALPHA is the long-awaited decentralized marketplace dApp within Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.io/downloads/]. The Alpha release of the marketplace will be\nbarebones to start as users begin to test and progress through the\nbuying/selling process.\n\nAs more users onboard we’ll continue refining the user experience and the tools\navailable to vendors and shoppers.\n\nListing Governance\nGovernance won’t be in our initial release of the Markeplace but is one of the\nitems in the pipeline this year. The vision of the Particl Project is to be a\nprivacy focused platform for decentralized applications.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is being built to be self-sustaining, self-governing and\ncompletely decentralized. Governance is a huge piece of the puzzle that the team\nwill be focused on developing to protect privacy and protect users.\n\nSoftware Development Kit (SDK)\nA plan to have a SDK for developers is in the pipeline. The SDK will allow the\ncreation of applications within the Marketplace or Desktop.\n\nThis might not come in 2018 from the Particl team (it is a pipeline item in the\nfuture) but could be a community development item someone takes on as a side\nproject to create. The full support of the dev team will be available to anyone\nwanting to contribute and help speed of delivery of valuable items.\n\n> A software development kit is typically a set of software development tools that\nallows the creation of applications for a certain software package, software\nframework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating\nsystem, or similar development platform. — Wikipedia\nZMQ for MP Messages\nShort for ZeroMQ [http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#-MQ-in-a-Hundred-Words],\nthis is an automated messaging system that allows messages and notifications to\nbe automatically pushed to Particl Desktop. An example would be if Particl\nDesktop has an update available, ZMQ will push notification to Particl Desktop\nand users will see a notice a new version of the Desktop is available.\n\nBETA Marketplace\nOur next major release of the decentralized marketplace will be BETA.\n\nBeta MP may or may-not be a mainnet viable product. It is too early to tell but\nis something the team will be transparent in communicating.\n\nFactors such as Governance and privacy (RingCT) are big factors on whether a\nmainnet marketplace is available in the next 6 months on mainnet. 50/50 is the\nbest bet at the moment; being completely honest and forthcoming.\n\nA Beta marketplace release with governance but without RingCT could happen with\nour Confidential TX’s (CT) already providing privacy on mainnet. CT do a good\njob of hiding amounts (MAD escrow) but don’t provide complete privacy for\naddresses of vendors and buyers in a escrow contract.\n\nPrivacy and Governance are 2 of the major factors that ultimately will determine\nthe BETA marketplace release in the coming 6 months.\n\nFull Particl Marketplace Release\nAll versions of the MP leading up to full release will be testing versions and\nlive versions with new features introduced at each release. Once RingCT is on\nmainnet, Governance is fully developed, and currency-agnostic options like\ncross-chain atomic swaps/integrations have been through the proper testing\nenvironment we’ll plan a Full Particl Marketplace Release.\n\nThis will be the truly private decentralized marketplace that will disrupt the\nway you buy and sell online.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRing Confidential Transactions (RingCT)\nSpeaking of privacy and RingCT, we will see some exciting movement on this\nprivacy enhancement in the next 6 months.\n\nAcademic Review\nIf you aren’t aware, NJIT research Qiang Tang [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/] is\nleading a group in a review of our RingCT privacy on Particl Testnet. Particl\nFoundation created a grant with the university in Sept. 2017 for this research,\nQiang’s lab received the grant money in Nov. 2017\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#activities] and began working on a 6 month review\nin Dec. 2017.\n\nThey are 3 months into review and will provide the foundation with a report\nafter 6 months on the privacy, cryptography and security recommendations for\nParticl’s RingCT implementation on the latest Bitcoin codebase.\n\nBulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions\nA very exciting paper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] was released in\nthe middle of our grant with Qiang (NJIT) that significantly reduces the burden\nof confidential transactions on the blockchain.\n\n> Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing\nproposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nParticl is the only Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency with Confidential Transactions\nlive and available today. We don’t allow CT to be default because of the\nsize/cost this privacy introduces to transactions. Here is an infographic you\nmay have seen showing the size/cost of each level of privacy for PART.\n\nYou can see that transaction size of CT and RingCT are 20x that of the\npseudo-anonymous “public” state most users default to.\n\nBulletproofs is a big development that we will be reviewing this year. We\nestimate research, development, implementation and testing will be a 3–4 month\npart-time assignment for Tecnovert, Particl Lead Core Developer.\n\nRingCT — Mainnet\nIt is fair to give a realistic checklist of the steps needed to see RingCT on\nParticl Mainnet in the coming months.

The\ncommunity needs to create a plan for these extra coins that were donated but not\nneeded. Start brainstorming!\n\nLightning Network\nA lot of excitement is stirring in the space because of lightning (LND)\nreleasing on mainnet. Obviously, this is a big item on our radar as we build\npaths for other cryptocurrency coins to be used on Particl Marketplace.\n\n#BlindLightning | #BlackLightning\nWhat if Particl Confidential TXs or even RingCT could be leveraged in atomic\nswaps/ lightning network transactions between PART and other coins — providing\ntrue privacy for non-private coins?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop — future versions\nIn our last AMAFAQ livestream we also mentioned the current status of our\nflagship app, Particl Desktop.\n\nNew features related to the Particl Marketplace integration into Desktop will be\nongoing throughout 2018. We’ve had a lot of requests for extra widgets and\nfeatures from the community/team that are moving down the pipeline.\n\nBelow we’ve begun a checklist of requested features.\n\n * Multiwallet modal\n * Coin Control\n * Alias Addresses\n * Balances and Staking graphs\n * Remote Daemon Connection\n * Tor Integration\n * Settings modal\n * Modal Refactoring\n\nParticl Marketplace is the main focus of the team moving forward, but you can\nexpect to see some of these features coming into Desktop as well. The\nmarketplace is priority number one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’re excited to see the impact Particl Marketplace and PART have in our space\nfor 2018–2019.
