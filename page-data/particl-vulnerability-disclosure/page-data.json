This\nannouncement will disclose the nature of the vulnerability and provide\npreliminary details surrounding the event.\n\nEmergency Hard Fork AnnouncementThe Particl team has found a critical issue in\nthe RingCT and CT code which requires a hardfork. Please update your Particl\nCore nodes immediately.cryptoguardBlog\n[https://particl.news/emergency-hardfork-announcement/]Above all, if you haven’t\nalready done so, please urgently download the new Particl Core (Particl Core\n0.19.2.5 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5])\nclient which can be found here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]. If you run a\ncold staking node, please update it immediately by typing the partyman update \ncommand. If you use the Particl Desktop client, launch it as soon as possible so\nthat it can automatically be updated with the new Particl Core version. If it's\nalready opened up, please shut it down completely and restart it.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * What Happened?\n * How Did This Happen?\n * The Solution\n * Investigating the Attack\n * FAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn the 20th of February, 2021, a significant discrepancy between the expected\nand real supply of Particl was observed and confirmed. This prompted the team to\nhastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of\na critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by\ndefeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be\nconfirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which\nled to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. It can also be confirmed\nthat at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred\nfrom anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack, according to\ntraces on the blockchain.\n\nThe vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the\nrelease of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.\n\nHow Did This Happen?\nUnderstanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in\nthe code which led to it.\n\nThe first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon\ntransactions. It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from\npublic balances to anon ones. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up\noutput values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used.\nThis vulnerability was located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342] \nin Particl’s code and has now been patched.\n\nAdditionally, a related issue was discovered that prevented the blind sum from\nbeing set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances. This means that\nall public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their\ninputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with\nabsolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are\nlegitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an\nanon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins.\nThis vulnerability is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836] \nin Particl’s code and has been patched as well.\n\nAt the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that at least\n768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon\nbalances to public ones. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is\nunclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon\noutputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. Any additional\ncoin added to this estimate would be the total number of legitimate PART coins\nthe community holds in anon balances.\n\nBe assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and\npreventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the\ninvestigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be\nadjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty,\neffectively restoring the chain’s integrity.\n\n> Note: Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and\nBulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab\nsecurity firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its\nimplementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.\nThe Solution\nThe solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can\nbe separated into two specific objectives.\n\n * Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and\n   transacted. (SUCCESS)\n * Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon\n   coins (IN PROGRESS)\n\nTo complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a\ncontingency plan that requires two hardforks.\n\nHardfork 1\nThe first hardfork, which has been successful already, fixed the vulnerabilities\nto prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT\nand CT transactions on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from\nbeing transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more\nexploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to\nthe attack.\n\nThe new client to make this hardfork happen (Particl Core 0.19.2.4\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4]) has already\nbeen pushed out publicly, but a new version (Particl Core 0.19.2.5\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]) has been\nreleased a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark\npreventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready\nfor the second hardfork.\n\nIf you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by\ninstalling the new Particl Core version\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5] or, at the very\nleast, the 0.19.2.4 version.\n\nHardfork 2\nThe second hardfork aims at restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities as well\nas restoring the integrity of the chain by disallowing exploited anon outputs\nfrom being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones. The conclusion of\nthe second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl\nblockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.\n\nOnce this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other\npeople once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that\nno exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs\noriginating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for\nlegitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to\nprove their legitimacy.\n\nThe Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these\nlegitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary\nin impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and\ncons.\n\nWhile they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the\ncommunity its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional\ntime to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are\nas efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!\n\n> Note: The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and\nchanges the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being\nunrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available\non the new client’s Github release page.\n> Note 2: The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl\nblockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking\nrewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has\ninflated.\nInvestigating the Attack\nSince the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and\ncollaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified\nand whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT,\nit may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions.\nIn any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be\ndisclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.\n\nIf you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you\ncan submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information\nto the rest of the team for the investigation. We appreciate every bit of help\nand would like to thank everyone who participates in this effort.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\nFAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\nWe understand that you may have questions related to this announcement; we are\nhere to help! The Particl team is committed to full transparency and user\nsupport through this evolving situation. \n\nTo that end, we will publish a follow-up blog post later on that will contain\nmore data and up-to-date information about the attack as we gather it.\n\nFrom that point, the team will then hold an FAQ session on our sub-Reddit to\nanswer any remaining questions. Cryptoguard will be available for answers with\nsupport from the Particl Core developers. This thread will be pinned on\nParticl's sub-Reddit and serve as the go-to FAQ resource for people with\nquestions about this event.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You!\nWe want to thank you for your support and patience as we work on collecting more\ndata, preparing for the second hardfork, and building the tools required to\nvalidate legitimate anon outputs. As this is an evolving situation, the Particl\nteam will keep you informed as more information is gathered, so keep an eye out\nfor any new blog post on Particl News!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This prompted the team to hastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of a critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by defeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be confirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which led to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. <strong>It can also be confirmed that at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack</strong>, according to traces on the blockchain.</p><p>The vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the release of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.</p><h1 id=\"how-did-this-happen\">How Did This Happen?</h1><p>Understanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in the code which led to it.</p><p>The first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. <strong>It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from public balances to anon ones</strong>. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up output values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used. This vulnerability was located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has now been patched.</p><p>Additionally, a related issue was discovered that <strong>prevented the blind sum from being set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances</strong>. This means that all public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their inputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with absolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are legitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an anon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins. This vulnerability is located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has been patched as well.</p><p>At the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that <strong>at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon balances to public ones</strong>. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is unclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon outputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. <strong><strong>Any additional coin added to this estimate would be the total number of</strong> legitimate<strong> PART coins the community holds in anon balances.</strong></strong></p><p>Be assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and preventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the investigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be adjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty, effectively restoring the chain’s integrity.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab security firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its implementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h1><p>The solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can be separated into two specific objectives.</p><ul><li>Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and transacted. (SUCCESS)</li><li>Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon coins (IN PROGRESS)</li></ul><p>To complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a contingency plan that requires two hardforks.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-1\">Hardfork 1</h3><p>The first hardfork, which has been successful already, <strong>fixed the vulnerabilities to prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT and CT transactions</strong> on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from being transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more exploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to the attack.</p><p>The new client to make this hardfork happen (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4\">Particl Core 0.19.2.4</a></strong>) has already been pushed out publicly, but a new version (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\">Particl Core 0.19.2.5</a></strong>) has been released a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark preventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready for the second hardfork.</p><p>If you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by installing <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\"><strong>the new Particl Core version</strong></a><strong> </strong>or, at the very least, the 0.19.2.4 version.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-2\">Hardfork 2</h3><p>The second hardfork aims at <strong>restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities</strong> as well as restoring the integrity of the chain by <strong>disallowing exploited anon outputs from being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones</strong>. The conclusion of the second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl blockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.</p><p>Once this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other people once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that no exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs originating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for legitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to prove their legitimacy.</p><p>The Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these legitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary in impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and cons.</p><p>While they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the community its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional time to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are as efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and changes the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being unrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available on the new client’s Github release page.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl blockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking rewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has inflated.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"investigating-the-attack\">Investigating the Attack</h1><p>Since the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and collaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified and whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT, it may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions. In any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be disclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.</p><p>If you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you can submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information to the rest of the team for the investigation. We appreciate every bit of help and would like to thank everyone who participates in this effort.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to Particl Core 0.19.2.5.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"faq-and-our-commitment-to-transparency\">FAQ and our Commitment to Transparency</h2><p>We understand that you may have questions related to this announcement; we are here to help!

Das bedeutet, dass\nes keine zentrale Instanz oder andere Zwischenhändler gibt, die die\nFunktionsweise im Hintergrund steuern, Server betreiben, Handelsgebühren\nerheben, oder irgendeine Form der Kontrolle über das Netzwerk ausüben.\nStattdessen bildet eine Kombination aus Peer-to-Peer-Netzwerk und\nBlockchain-Technologie die Grundlage des Particl-Netzwerkes. Der Betrieb wird\nvon jedem an das Netzwerk angeschlossene Computer sichergestellt. In vielerlei\nHinsicht ähnelt diese Funktionsweise sogenannten P2P Torrent-Netzwerken und ist\ndeshalb zensurresistent. \n\nDer Particl Marketplace ist eine gleichermaßen dezentral organisierte Anwendung,\ndie von der Funktionsweise des Particl-Netzwerkes profitiert. Diese erlaubt es\nKäufern und Verkäufern weltweit Güter und Dienstleistungen (sowohl physisch als\nauch digital) sicher zu handeln. Die Benutzung des Marktplatzes ist kostenfrei\nund erfolgt ohne Registrierung, Anmeldung oder Angabe persönlicher Daten (KYC).\nAufgrund seiner dezentralen Grundzüge gibt es ebenso kein Personal oder\nSupport-Team, das etwaige Konflikte zwischen Käufern und Verkäufern schlichtet.\nDas bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass es kein System gibt, das beide Parteien dazu\nbringt, ehrlich und lösungsorientiert zu handeln. Doch dazu später mehr.\n\nDer Particl Marketplace ist zudem \"private by default\", was konkret bedeutet,\ndass persönliche Daten und Transaktionen des Marktplatzes nicht mit seinen\nNutzern in Verbindung gebracht werden können. Transaktionen werden auf der\nBlockchain verborgen, Bilder von Metadaten befreit, der Austausch von sensiblen\nDaten und Kommunikation allgemein, findet verschlüsselt statt. Darüber hinaus\nlässt sich der gesamte Marktplatz über das Tor-Netzwerk verbinden. Mit anderen\nWorten, Nutzer von Particl sind auf dem neuesten Stand der\nVerschlüsselungstechnik. Mehr Datenschutz und Privatsphäre gibt es im E-Commerce\nnicht.\n\nVertrauensvoll miteinander handeln \nAllerdings kreiert die Kombination der oben erwähnten Eigenschaften des\nMarktplatzes ein nicht zu unterschätzendes Problem: Wie kann überhaupt Vertrauen\nzwischen zwei Parteien - Verkäufer und Käufer - entstehen, wenn Güter und\nDienstleistungen angeboten, verkauft und versendet werden, es aber keinen\nTreuhänder gibt?\n\nFür herkömmliche Marktplätze stellt diese Frage kein besonderes Problem dar,\njedenfalls nicht kundenseitig. Entweder wird eine Form der Konfliktlösung\nangeboten oder ein Treuhandsystem (escrow system) geschaffen, das dafür Sorge\nträgt, dass Handelspartner ehrlich agieren. Und das funktioniert... meistens\njedenfalls\n[https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/top-ebay-scams-14781610].\n\nIm Gegensatz dazu ist der Particl Marketplace komplett dezentral organisiert und\nauf den Datenschutz seiner Nutzer ausgerichtet. Folglich gibt es auch kein\nPersonal, das Konfliktlösungen bearbeitet oder garantieren könnte, dass alle\nAkteure ehrlich handeln.\n\nDie Frage bleibt bestehen: Wie es möglich ist, dass Käufer und Verkäufer davon\nabgehalten werden, unehrlich zu handeln, wenn erstens ihre Identität nicht\nbekannt ist, und es zweitens keine zentrale Instanz gibt, die betrügerisches\nVerhalten sanktioniert? Schickt der Käufer etwa das Geld und hofft, dass das\ngekaufte Produkt in einem guten Zustand ankommt, wenn es überhaupt ankommt?\nNimmt der Verkäufer das Risiko auf sich, das verkaufte Produkt zur Post zu\nbringen, bevor er das Geld in seinen Händen hält? \n\nAlles läuft auf Vertrauen hinaus. Während es noch nie ratsam schien, einem\nFremden im Internet blindlings zu vertrauen, scheint dieser Tatbestand im\nKontext der besten und neuesten Verschlüsselungstechniken\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/], die\ndas Particl-Netzwerk zur Verfügung stellt, eine ausgemachte Dummheit zu sein,\ndie der Vergangenheit angehört.\n\nDenn hier kommt Particls Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem ins Spiel.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDas Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem\nVergleichbar mit herkömmlichen Marktplätzen nutzt Particl ein Treuhandsystem,\ndas betrügerisches Verhalten sanktioniert. Im Gegensatz zu bekannten\nTreuhandsystemen ist der Marktplatz \"trustless\", sodass grundsätzlich kein\nVertrauen gegenüber einem anderen Akteur notwendig ist, um sicherzustellen, das\neine Transaktion im besten Interesse beider Parteien abläuft. Wir meinen also\nmit dem Wort \"trustless\" nicht Unzuverlässigkeit, sondern eine Transferleistung,\ndie den einseitigen Vertrauensvorschuss einer Partei, zu Gunsten einer\nbeidseitig zu hinterlegenden Sicherheitsleistung (Deposit) auflöst. Die\nVerwendung des Treuhandsystems ist daneben kostenfrei, \"private by default\" und\nwird autonom zwischen Käufer und Verkäufer abgewickelt.\n\nEin Treuhandsystem, das keinen weiteren Mittelsmann (middle man) für die\nAbwicklung benötigt, ist aus mehreren Gründen bahnbrechend. Zum einen wird der\nDatenschutz aller beteiligten Akteure erhöht, indem sensible Daten, wie\n Transaktionsinformationen, persönliche Kontodaten, Kreditkartendaten,\nSendungsnummern, Nachrichten und alle anderen persönlichen Informationen,\ngegenüber Dritten verborgen bleiben. Verkäufer und Käufer kennen nur ihre\ndirekte Kommunikation, etwaige Sendungsadressen, und ggf. eine Sendungsnummer.\nZum anderen kann kein externer Akteur für Dienste rund um die Abwicklung des\nKaufes Gebühren erheben, weil es schlicht keine Dienste gibt, die von einem\nexternen Akteur, sei dies ein Treuhänder oder ein Support-Mitarbeiter, angeboten\nwerden können.\n\nEin weiterer positiver Nebeneffekt des Treuhandsystem ist, dass bei einem\nexponentiellen Anstieg der Nutzerzahlen, Particl Marketplace genauso skalierbar\nist, wie das Netzwerk selbst. So müssen keine weiteren Mitarbeiter eingestellt\nwerden, was Particl deutlich von andere dezentralen Marktplätzen unterscheidet\n(z.B.: OpenBazaars 3-von-2 Treuhandsystem).\n\nIn der Theorie klingt das alles schön und gut, doch schulden wir euch noch eine\nErklärung, wie das überhaupt funktioniert und Particl sicherstellt, dass zwei\nAkteure ehrlich miteinander handeln, ohne dass beide dabei von einem Mittelsmann\nzur Ehrlichkeit angehalten oder gar überwacht werden können.\n\nParticls Treuhandsystem und seine Funktionsweise \n\nUm Käufer und Verkäufer daran zu hindern, unehrlich zu agieren, wird in der\nRegel eine Form der Bestrafung oder Abschreckungsmaßnahme eingeführt. Auf\nherkömmlichen Marktplätzen wird diese Rolle normalerweise von einem Moderator\neingenommen, der betrügerisches Verhalten bestraft. Diese Bestrafungen laufen in\nder Regel einseitig ab, da eCommerce-Plattformen meistens die Käuferseite\nbegünstigen.\n[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay] Auf\ndem Particl Marketplace werden Bestrafungen oder Abschreckungsmechanismen\nmittels eines autonomen Treuhandsystems und der Spieltheorie sichergestellt.\n\nDie Funktionsweise von Particls Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem ist genauso einfach,\nwie effektiv. Kommt es zu einer Marktplatz-Transaktion müssen sowohl Verkäufer\nals auch Käufer gleichgestellt werden, indem von beiden Seiten jeweils eine\nSicherheitsleistung in einen sogenannten Smart Contract\n[https://www.btc-echo.de/academy/bibliothek/smart-contracts/] eingezahlt wird,\nder als Treuhandkonto fungiert. Die Sicherheitsleistung spiegelt jeweils eine\nEinzahlungen wieder - eine vom Käufer und eine vom Verkäufer, die wiederum\njeweils den Wert des Gegenstandes sowie die Versandkosten abdecken. \n\nDie Sicherheit muss von beiden Parteien eingezahlt werden, sodass der doppelte\nWert (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten) vom Käufer und der einfache\nWert (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten) vom Verkäufer innerhalb des\nSmart Contracts gebündelt wird. Das stellt sicher, dass beide Parteien mit\ngleichen Anteilen am Handelsrisiko beteiligt sind. Erst wenn beide Seiten\nbestätigen, dass die Transaktion erfolgreich abgewickelt wurde, erhalten beide\nihre eingezahlte Sicherheit zurück. Hierbei fallen keine weiteren Gebühren an\nals die üblichen Transaktionsgebühren von Kryptowährungen, sodass die Benutzung\npraktisch kostenlos zur Verfügung steht. \n\nUm dies treffend zu veranschaulichen, soll das Beispiel eines Einkaufs\nherangezogen werden, indem der Käufer insgesamt 220€ in den Smart Contract\neinzahlt. Der Wert des Gegenstandes beträgt hier 100€, die Versandkosten 10€,\nund der Wert der Sicherheit somit 110€ (NB: Die Sicherheit besteht aus der Summe\ndes Gegenstandswertes und der Versandkosten), die der Käufer nach dem\nerfolgreichen Abschluss der Transaktion zurückerhält.\n\nDer Verkäufer muss nun seinerseits die Einzahlung der Sicherheit von 110€\nvornehmen, sodass beide Seiten jeweils 110€ (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und\nVersandkosten) als Sicherheit in den Smart Contract eingezahlt haben. Der Käufer\nhat den Kaufpreis ebenfalls in den o.e. Smart Contract eingezahlt. Der Verkäufer\nmuss den Versand übernehmen, wobei hier der Gegenstand mit einem Wert von 100€\nund die Versandkosten von 10€ anfallen, sodass beiden Parteien schliesslich mit\n220€ und damit zu gleichen Anteilen am Handelsrisiko beteiligt sind.\n\nWährend die finanziellen Mittel beider Parteien in dem Smart Contract besichert\nsind, wird der Verkäufer das Paket versandfertig machen und versenden. Sobald\nder Käufer die Sendung erhalten und auf seine Richtigkeit hin überprüft hat,\nwird er den Empfang bestätigen. Sobald die Transaktion als \"complete\" vom Käufer\nbestätigt wurde, erfolgt automatisch die Rückzahlung der Sicherheit an Käufer\nund Verkäufer, sowie die Auszahlung des Kaufpreises (inklusive Versandkosten) an\nden Verkäufer.\n\nMutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Spieltheorie\nDer Grund dafür, dass eine \"gegenseitig zugesicherte Zerstörung\", wie sie die\nsogenannte MAD-Doktrin nahelegt, ganz praktisch im eCommerce Anwendung findet,\nist naheliegend: Sollte eine der beiden Parteien - Käufer oder Verkäufer –\nunzufrieden sein, wird die die Transaktion nicht als \"complete\" markiert und\nhindert damit die andere Seite daran, die eingezahlte Sicherheit aus dem\nTreuhandkonto zurückzuerhalten. Die einzige Möglichkeit seine Sicherheit\nerstattet zu bekommen, besteht darin, im Dialog, eine für beide Seiten\nzufriedenstellende Lösung zu finden. Erst dann wird die Transaktion von beiden\nSeiten bestätigt und die Sicherheit automatisch zurückgezahlt werden.\n\nDiese Dynamik wird mithin alsMutually Assured Destruction (MAD)\n[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichgewicht_des_Schreckens]beschrieben. Es\nhandelt sich um eine bekannte Doktrin\n[https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/]\n, die ihre Prämissen der Spieltheorie verdankt. Die Theorie besagt, dass zwei\nNuklearmächte im Falle einer kriegerischen Auseinandersetzung keinen Gebrauch\nder vorhandenen Atomwaffen machen werden. Der Grund dafür liegt auf der Hand:\nSollte ein Land seine Atomwaffe dennoch benutzen, kann es mit Sicherheit davon\nausgehen, dass das angegriffene Land zu den selben Mitteln greifen und damit\nweitestgehend die Auslöschung beider Seiten zur Folge haben wird. In diesem\nSzenario verlieren beide Seiten und werden dem Boden gleichgemacht, weshalb\ndieses spieltheoretische Szenario auch vielsagend als Mutually Assured\nDestruction („gegenseitig zugesicherte Zerstörung“) bekannt wurde. \n\nDie Effektivität dieses spieltheoretischen Szenarios konnte man anschaulich\nwährend des Kalten Krieges beobachten, als sich sowohl die USA als auch die\nUdSSR mit ihren Atomwaffenarsenalen gegenüberstanden. Obwohl die Atomwaffen\njederzeit abschussbereit und auf den Gegner ausgerichtet waren, kamen sie aus\nSorge vor den möglichen Vergeltungsmaßnahmen der anderen Seite nicht zum\nEinsatz.\n\nWelche Rolle spielt das Szenario in Particls Treuhandsystem?\nDie Ähnlichkeiten sind frappierend, außer, dass es sich im Fall von Particl\nnicht um den Einsatz von Atomwaffen, sondern die Drohung eines finanziellen\nVerlustgeschäfts handelt. Der zentrale Aspekt der MAD-Spieltheorie für das\nTreuhandsystem von Particl liegt darin begründet, dass das (uneinsichtige)\nFehlverhalten einer Partei, zu einer Bestrafung von beiden Parteien, also einer \ngegenseitig zugesicherten Zerstörung, führt. Da beide Parteien eine Sicherheit\neingezahlt haben, die im Falle einer ausbleibenden Streitschlichtung für immer\nzerstört wird, internalisiert Particl ein negatives Anreizsystem, dass das\nFehlverhalten mittels eines finanziellen Verlustes sanktioniert.\n\nSollten beide Parteien kein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis finden, werden die\njeweils eingezahlten Sicherheiten (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten),\nnicht zurückgezahlt, sodass die Folge ein Nettoverlust für alle Beteiligten\ndarstellt. Der drohende Verlust der eingezahlten Sicherheit liefert einen klaren\nAnreiz, selbstständig eine Einigung zu erzielen, ohne dass dabei eine\nDrittpartei als Schiedsrichter fungiert. Sollte keine Einigkeit erzielt werden,\nverlieren beide Geld, und niemand, der bei Verstand ist, kann das wollen. Sollte\nalso eine Einigung erzielt werden, kann die Transaktion weiterhin erfolgreich\nabgeschlossen werden. Hierbei fallen keine Gebühren an (mit Ausnahme der\nüblichen Transaktionsgebühren von Kryptowährungen) und es werden daneben auch\nkeine sensiblen Daten preisgegeben.\n\nParticls Treuhandsystem stärkt den Handlungsspielraum seiner Nutzer und\ngarantiert darüber hinaus, dass keine Information über die Transaktion oder die\nan ihr beteiligten Akteure an Dritte weitergegeben werden können. Die\nAnwendungsbereiche dieses bahnbrechenden Modells sind vielfältig, insbesondere\ndort, wo Lieferketten und sensible Geschäftsabkommen zwischen Unternehmen, aber\nauch zwischen Privatpersonen vor den Augen unbefugter Dritter bewahrt bleiben\nsollen. Aus diesem Grund können auch keine Konteninformationen an einen\nZwischenhändler weitergegeben werden, kein Verlaufsdaten bisheriger\nTransaktionen eingesehen, weder Sendungsnummern noch Lieferadressen oder andere\npersönliche Nachrichten ausgelesen werden. Darüber hinaus gibt es nichts, was\nauf der Blockchain gespeichert wird, dass es Dritten erlauben würde, jemanden zu\nidentifizieren oder Handeln rückzuverfolgen.\n\nDu bist der Nutzer, nicht das Produkt.\n\nPrivatsphäre\nDie wahrscheinlich wichtigste Besonderheit des gesamten Treuhandsystems von\nParticl ist, dass alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz mittels RingCT (kurz für\n\"Ring Confidential Transactions\") vertraulich über das Netzwerk überwiesen\nwerden. Der Smart Contract selbst, über den das Treuhandsystem abgewickelt wird,\nnutzt \"Confidential Transactions\" (CT), aber alle eingehenden und ausgehenden\nÜberweisungen des Smart Contracts werden mittels RingCT übertragen.

Ein Nebeneffekt davon besteht in der Erhöhung\naller sogenannten RingCT Outputs, die wiederum den Datenschutz der gesamten\nPlattform erhöhen.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHast du Interesse mehr über Particl, die Plattform und den Marketplace zu\nerfahren?

Auf herkömmlichen Marktplätzen wird diese Rolle normalerweise von einem Moderator eingenommen, der betrügerisches Verhalten bestraft. Diese Bestrafungen laufen in der Regel einseitig ab, da <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay\">eCommerce-Plattformen meistens die Käuferseite begünstigen.</a> Auf dem Particl Marketplace werden Bestrafungen oder Abschreckungsmechanismen mittels eines <strong>autonomen Treuhandsystems</strong> und der <strong>Spieltheorie</strong> sichergestellt.</p><p>Die Funktionsweise von Particls Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem ist genauso einfach, wie effektiv. <strong>Kommt es zu einer Marktplatz-Transaktion müssen sowohl Verkäufer als auch Käufer gleichgestellt werden, indem von beiden Seiten jeweils eine Sicherheitsleistung in einen sogenannten <a href=\"https://www.btc-echo.de/academy/bibliothek/smart-contracts/\">Smart Contract</a> eingezahlt wird, der als Treuhandkonto fungiert. Die Sicherheitsleistung spiegelt jeweils eine Einzahlungen wieder - eine vom Käufer und eine vom Verkäufer, die wiederum jeweils den Wert des Gegenstandes sowie die Versandkosten abdecken.</strong> </p><p>Die Sicherheit muss von beiden Parteien eingezahlt werden, sodass der doppelte Wert (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten) vom Käufer und der einfache Wert (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten) vom Verkäufer innerhalb des Smart Contracts gebündelt wird. Das stellt sicher, dass beide Parteien mit gleichen Anteilen am Handelsrisiko beteiligt sind. Erst wenn beide Seiten bestätigen, dass die Transaktion erfolgreich abgewickelt wurde, erhalten beide ihre eingezahlte Sicherheit zurück. Hierbei fallen keine weiteren Gebühren an als die üblichen Transaktionsgebühren von Kryptowährungen, sodass die Benutzung praktisch kostenlos zur Verfügung steht. </p><p>Um dies treffend zu veranschaulichen, soll das Beispiel eines Einkaufs herangezogen werden, indem der Käufer insgesamt 220€ in den Smart Contract einzahlt. Der Wert des Gegenstandes beträgt hier 100€, die Versandkosten 10€, und der Wert der Sicherheit somit 110€ (NB: Die Sicherheit besteht aus der Summe des Gegenstandswertes und der Versandkosten), die der Käufer nach dem erfolgreichen Abschluss der Transaktion zurückerhält.</p><p>Der Verkäufer muss nun seinerseits die Einzahlung der Sicherheit von 110€ vornehmen, sodass beide Seiten jeweils 110€ (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten) als Sicherheit in den Smart Contract eingezahlt haben. Der Käufer hat den Kaufpreis ebenfalls in den o.e. Smart Contract eingezahlt. Der Verkäufer muss den Versand übernehmen, wobei hier der Gegenstand mit einem Wert von 100€ und die Versandkosten von 10€ anfallen, sodass beiden Parteien schliesslich mit 220€ und damit zu gleichen Anteilen am Handelsrisiko beteiligt sind.</p><p>Während die finanziellen Mittel beider Parteien in dem Smart Contract besichert sind, wird der Verkäufer das Paket versandfertig machen und versenden. Sobald der Käufer die Sendung erhalten und auf seine Richtigkeit hin überprüft hat, wird er den Empfang bestätigen. Sobald die Transaktion als \"complete\" vom Käufer bestätigt wurde, erfolgt automatisch die Rückzahlung der Sicherheit an Käufer und Verkäufer, sowie die Auszahlung des Kaufpreises (inklusive Versandkosten) an den Verkäufer.</p><h3 id=\"mutually-assured-destruction-mad-spieltheorie\">Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Spieltheorie</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpg 600w\"></figure><p>Der Grund dafür, dass eine \"gegenseitig zugesicherte Zerstörung\", wie sie die sogenannte MAD-Doktrin nahelegt, ganz praktisch im eCommerce Anwendung findet, ist naheliegend: Sollte eine der beiden Parteien - Käufer oder Verkäufer – unzufrieden sein, wird die die Transaktion nicht als \"complete\" markiert und hindert damit die andere Seite daran, die eingezahlte Sicherheit aus dem Treuhandkonto zurückzuerhalten. Die einzige Möglichkeit seine Sicherheit erstattet zu bekommen, besteht darin, im Dialog, eine für beide Seiten zufriedenstellende Lösung zu finden. Erst dann wird die Transaktion von beiden Seiten bestätigt und die Sicherheit automatisch zurückgezahlt werden.</p><p>Diese Dynamik wird mithin als  <em><a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichgewicht_des_Schreckens\"><em><strong><strong>Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</strong></strong></em><strong> </strong></a></em>beschrieben. Es handelt sich um <a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/\">eine bekannte Doktrin</a>, die ihre Prämissen der Spieltheorie verdankt. Die Theorie besagt, dass zwei Nuklearmächte im Falle einer kriegerischen Auseinandersetzung keinen Gebrauch der vorhandenen Atomwaffen machen werden. Der Grund dafür liegt auf der Hand: Sollte ein Land seine Atomwaffe dennoch benutzen, kann es mit Sicherheit davon ausgehen, dass das angegriffene Land zu den selben Mitteln greifen und damit weitestgehend die Auslöschung beider Seiten zur Folge haben wird. In diesem Szenario verlieren beide Seiten und werden dem Boden gleichgemacht, weshalb dieses spieltheoretische Szenario auch vielsagend als <em><em>Mutually Assured Destruction</em> (</em>„gegenseitig zugesicherte Zerstörung“) bekannt wurde. </p><p>Die Effektivität dieses spieltheoretischen Szenarios konnte man anschaulich während des Kalten Krieges beobachten, als sich sowohl die USA als auch die UdSSR mit ihren Atomwaffenarsenalen gegenüberstanden. Obwohl die Atomwaffen jederzeit abschussbereit und auf den Gegner ausgerichtet waren, kamen sie aus Sorge vor den möglichen Vergeltungsmaßnahmen der anderen Seite nicht zum Einsatz.</p><h3 id=\"welche-rolle-spielt-das-szenario-in-particls-treuhandsystem\">Welche Rolle spielt das Szenario in Particls Treuhandsystem?</h3><p>Die Ähnlichkeiten sind frappierend, außer, dass es sich im Fall von Particl nicht um den Einsatz von Atomwaffen, sondern die Drohung eines finanziellen Verlustgeschäfts handelt. Der zentrale Aspekt der MAD-Spieltheorie für das Treuhandsystem von Particl liegt darin begründet, dass das (uneinsichtige) Fehlverhalten einer Partei, zu einer Bestrafung von beiden Parteien, also einer <em>gegenseitig zugesicherten Zerstörung</em>, führt. Da beide Parteien eine Sicherheit eingezahlt haben, die im Falle einer ausbleibenden Streitschlichtung für immer zerstört wird, internalisiert Particl ein negatives Anreizsystem, dass das Fehlverhalten mittels eines finanziellen Verlustes sanktioniert.</p><p>Sollten beide Parteien kein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis finden, werden die jeweils eingezahlten Sicherheiten (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten), nicht zurückgezahlt, sodass die Folge ein Nettoverlust für alle Beteiligten darstellt. Der drohende Verlust der eingezahlten Sicherheit liefert einen klaren Anreiz, selbstständig eine Einigung zu erzielen, ohne dass dabei eine Drittpartei als Schiedsrichter fungiert. Sollte keine Einigkeit erzielt werden, verlieren beide Geld, und niemand, der bei Verstand ist, kann das wollen. Sollte also eine Einigung erzielt werden, kann die Transaktion weiterhin erfolgreich abgeschlossen werden. Hierbei fallen keine Gebühren an (mit Ausnahme der üblichen Transaktionsgebühren von Kryptowährungen) und es werden daneben auch keine sensiblen Daten preisgegeben.</p><p>Particls Treuhandsystem stärkt den Handlungsspielraum seiner Nutzer und garantiert darüber hinaus, dass keine Information über die Transaktion oder die an ihr beteiligten Akteure an Dritte weitergegeben werden können. Die Anwendungsbereiche dieses bahnbrechenden Modells sind vielfältig, insbesondere dort, wo Lieferketten und sensible Geschäftsabkommen zwischen Unternehmen, aber auch zwischen Privatpersonen vor den Augen unbefugter Dritter bewahrt bleiben sollen. Aus diesem Grund können auch keine Konteninformationen an einen Zwischenhändler weitergegeben werden, kein Verlaufsdaten bisheriger Transaktionen eingesehen, weder Sendungsnummern noch Lieferadressen oder andere persönliche Nachrichten ausgelesen werden. Darüber hinaus gibt es nichts, was auf der Blockchain gespeichert wird, dass es Dritten erlauben würde, jemanden zu identifizieren oder Handeln rückzuverfolgen.</p><p>Du bist der Nutzer, nicht das Produkt.</p><h3 id=\"privatsph-re\">Privatsphäre</h3><p>Die wahrscheinlich wichtigste Besonderheit des gesamten Treuhandsystems von Particl ist, dass alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz mittels RingCT (kurz für \"Ring Confidential Transactions\") vertraulich über das Netzwerk überwiesen werden.

Erst dann wird die Transaktion von beiden Seiten bestätigt und die Sicherheit automatisch zurückgezahlt werden.</p><p>Diese Dynamik wird mithin als  <em><a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichgewicht_des_Schreckens\"><em><strong><strong>Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</strong></strong></em><strong> </strong></a></em>beschrieben. Es handelt sich um <a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/\">eine bekannte Doktrin</a>, die ihre Prämissen der Spieltheorie verdankt. Die Theorie besagt, dass zwei Nuklearmächte im Falle einer kriegerischen Auseinandersetzung keinen Gebrauch der vorhandenen Atomwaffen machen werden. Der Grund dafür liegt auf der Hand: Sollte ein Land seine Atomwaffe dennoch benutzen, kann es mit Sicherheit davon ausgehen, dass das angegriffene Land zu den selben Mitteln greifen und damit weitestgehend die Auslöschung beider Seiten zur Folge haben wird. In diesem Szenario verlieren beide Seiten und werden dem Boden gleichgemacht, weshalb dieses spieltheoretische Szenario auch vielsagend als <em><em>Mutually Assured Destruction</em> (</em>„gegenseitig zugesicherte Zerstörung“) bekannt wurde. </p><p>Die Effektivität dieses spieltheoretischen Szenarios konnte man anschaulich während des Kalten Krieges beobachten, als sich sowohl die USA als auch die UdSSR mit ihren Atomwaffenarsenalen gegenüberstanden. Obwohl die Atomwaffen jederzeit abschussbereit und auf den Gegner ausgerichtet waren, kamen sie aus Sorge vor den möglichen Vergeltungsmaßnahmen der anderen Seite nicht zum Einsatz.</p><h3 id=\"welche-rolle-spielt-das-szenario-in-particls-treuhandsystem\">Welche Rolle spielt das Szenario in Particls Treuhandsystem?</h3><p>Die Ähnlichkeiten sind frappierend, außer, dass es sich im Fall von Particl nicht um den Einsatz von Atomwaffen, sondern die Drohung eines finanziellen Verlustgeschäfts handelt. Der zentrale Aspekt der MAD-Spieltheorie für das Treuhandsystem von Particl liegt darin begründet, dass das (uneinsichtige) Fehlverhalten einer Partei, zu einer Bestrafung von beiden Parteien, also einer <em>gegenseitig zugesicherten Zerstörung</em>, führt. Da beide Parteien eine Sicherheit eingezahlt haben, die im Falle einer ausbleibenden Streitschlichtung für immer zerstört wird, internalisiert Particl ein negatives Anreizsystem, dass das Fehlverhalten mittels eines finanziellen Verlustes sanktioniert.</p><p>Sollten beide Parteien kein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis finden, werden die jeweils eingezahlten Sicherheiten (Summe aus Gegenstandswert und Versandkosten), nicht zurückgezahlt, sodass die Folge ein Nettoverlust für alle Beteiligten darstellt. Der drohende Verlust der eingezahlten Sicherheit liefert einen klaren Anreiz, selbstständig eine Einigung zu erzielen, ohne dass dabei eine Drittpartei als Schiedsrichter fungiert. Sollte keine Einigkeit erzielt werden, verlieren beide Geld, und niemand, der bei Verstand ist, kann das wollen. Sollte also eine Einigung erzielt werden, kann die Transaktion weiterhin erfolgreich abgeschlossen werden. Hierbei fallen keine Gebühren an (mit Ausnahme der üblichen Transaktionsgebühren von Kryptowährungen) und es werden daneben auch keine sensiblen Daten preisgegeben.</p><p>Particls Treuhandsystem stärkt den Handlungsspielraum seiner Nutzer und garantiert darüber hinaus, dass keine Information über die Transaktion oder die an ihr beteiligten Akteure an Dritte weitergegeben werden können. Die Anwendungsbereiche dieses bahnbrechenden Modells sind vielfältig, insbesondere dort, wo Lieferketten und sensible Geschäftsabkommen zwischen Unternehmen, aber auch zwischen Privatpersonen vor den Augen unbefugter Dritter bewahrt bleiben sollen. Aus diesem Grund können auch keine Konteninformationen an einen Zwischenhändler weitergegeben werden, kein Verlaufsdaten bisheriger Transaktionen eingesehen, weder Sendungsnummern noch Lieferadressen oder andere persönliche Nachrichten ausgelesen werden. Darüber hinaus gibt es nichts, was auf der Blockchain gespeichert wird, dass es Dritten erlauben würde, jemanden zu identifizieren oder Handeln rückzuverfolgen.</p><p>Du bist der Nutzer, nicht das Produkt.</p><h3 id=\"privatsph-re\">Privatsphäre</h3><p>Die wahrscheinlich wichtigste Besonderheit des gesamten Treuhandsystems von Particl ist, dass alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz mittels RingCT (kurz für \"Ring Confidential Transactions\") vertraulich über das Netzwerk überwiesen werden. Der Smart Contract selbst, über den das Treuhandsystem abgewickelt wird, nutzt \"Confidential Transactions\" (CT), aber alle eingehenden und ausgehenden Überweisungen des Smart Contracts werden mittels RingCT übertragen.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
