This update is a major one and contains a lot of information\nabout what has transpired in the past few weeks and what’s coming ahead with\nParticl in 2021 and beyond. Indeed, you DON’T want to skip on this update so\nlet’s jump right into it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * Latest Information on the Inflationary Bug and the Proposed Solutions\n * Particl V3 Update\n * A Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model\n * Atomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop\n * New CCS Proposal\n * Particl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLatest Information on the Inflationary Bug and the Proposed Solutions\nSince the initial disclosure of the inflationary vulnerability\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/], the Particl team has\nbeen working on solutions to whitelist legitimate anon outputs but keep the\nexploited ones frozen in perpetuity. Today, we are happy to bring more details\nand clarity on the situation and explain the way forward.\n\nHardforks Schedule\nTo limit the impact of having RingCT and CT transactions disabled any further\n(such as, for example, the inability to release Particl V3 without it), the team\nhas opted to adopt a multi-fork approach instead of a two-fork one, as initially\nproposed.\n\nNext Hardfork\nThe next hardfork, which is expected to go live in April, will re-enable RingCT\nand CT transactions as well unfreeze the majority of legitimate outputs\ncurrently frozen. Once completed, it will also enable the Particl V3 release to\ngo live on mainnet.\n\nIf you want to know all the changes integrated into the second hardfork, please\nconsult its PR on Github by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\n\nHf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-coreSecond fork of\nexploit\nfix. RCT exploit fix. Hard fork 2 consensus changes: All frozen anon and blind\noutputs must be spent to plain with no blinded change. Blinding factor sum for\nCT txns is ...GitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81]At\nthis time, the majority of the base requirements for the second hardfork to go\nlive are ready. The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to\nwhitelist outputs and undergoing a full RingCT and CT internal audit to ensure\nthe code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.\n\nAdditionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a\ntreasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the\ntreasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next\nhardfork.\n\nLegitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process\nUsers with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move\nthem back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be\npossible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a\nprocess involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that\ncategory, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork\na bit later on after the next one.\n\nHere are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.\n\n 1. A “low pass filter” will allow any output that contains a number of coins\n    below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large\n    outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze\n    exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a\n    separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.\n 2. Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold\n    will need to go through a manual claim process that will require them to\n    prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which\n    method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to\n    the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team)\n    and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs\n    will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in\n    the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized\n    and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can\n    single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process\n    will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on\n    Particl News.\n\nAs this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough\ntime-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough\ntime to do so.\n\nAdjusted Total Supply and Implications\nOne of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which\nisn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the\nstealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is\nthe one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted\nto its actual value in two different ways.\n\nFirst off, the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their\nlegitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter. Whenever a\nsuccessful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect\nit and adjust its supply accordingly.\n\nSecondly, the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists\noutputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live. Any new coin being\nunfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.\n\nWhat this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will\nbe fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation\nsupply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to\nrange between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins\n(768,767 coins).\n\nPlease take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information\nthe team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the\nteam, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being\nslightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those\nnumbers.\n\nOther Implications\nThis inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.\n\n * An increase in staking rewards size will be observed. In fact, the size of\n   rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example,\n   the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will\n   also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are\n   calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.\n * Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted\n   privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The\n   Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a\n   different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been\n   found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like\n   to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the\n   situation.\n\nParticl V3 Update\nIt can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the\nfinalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led\nto a strain in time availability. This is in the process of being resolved and\nwe expect the development of Particl V3 and Particl Desktop to resume at its\nusual pace (and, more likely, at a faster pace than it used to) in the next few\ndays.\n\nFor this reason, we do not have any specific update on Particl V3 for the\nmoment, but we fully expect to have a report ready to go live before the next\nProject Update in April. We also expect the new testnet version to go live\nbefore that time.\n\nTo understand a bit more where things are headed for Particl and how the project\nis about to get back full steam ahead, carefully read the next section.\n\nA Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model\nAs it was communicated a few months ago\n[https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement], the Particl Foundation has\npaid all outstanding payments to its contractors (which includes developers).\nThis necessary action (due to agreed commitments with said contractors) has\nseverely depleted the Foundation’s reserves leading it to initiate its shutdown\nprocess.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team had to pause salaries until a new funding solution\nappeared, which caused the project to temporarily go back to a voluntary-based\ncontribution model. This has, unfortunately, led to a considerable reduction in\ntime availability for most of the team members due to other temporary\ncommitments needed to be made to make ends meet.\n\nAdditionally, the looming release of Particl V3, which is arguably the biggest\nParticl release ever since the project’s inception, is right around the corner\nwith only a few changes needed to be applied for it to go live on mainnet. The\nproblem? The team doesn’t have access to proper funding anymore to promote it at\nits just value and give it the exposure it deserves. This situation, combined\nwith the voluntary-basis contribution model that is in play, motivated the team\nto work on a creative but effective solution to get the project funded once\nagain and be back in action full steam ahead.\n\nA New and Improved Treasury Model\nFor the reasons mentioned above, and to ensure the proper development and\neffective promotion of the project in the many years to come, the team has been\nworking relentlessly on a new, more robust treasury model which would guarantee\nenough funding to support the project. This would ultimately provide the project\nwith just as much financial support as the project had at its peak and\neventually surpass this level.\n\nThe new treasury model being designed doesn’t aim at reinventing the wheel. At\ncurrent PART prices, self-sustainability can be achieved by tweaking the current\ntreasury model which, at this moment, reserves 10% of all the staking rewards to\nsupport the project. The Particl team is modelling the new treasury figures\nafter that of very successful and top-rated projects in the space such as\nDecred, Siacoin, and others which have adopted similar self-funding strategy.\nDoing so has proven to be an overwhelming and indisputable success for these\nprojects.\n\nWhat to Expect?\nWhile the numbers around the new treasury model are still being simulated and\nevaluated, this would allow for the immediate full funding of the Particl team\nat current PART prices and would provide enough funds to reserve in various\nbudgets aimed at supporting and promoting the project as well as stimulate user\ngrowth.\n\nAs the treasury model is based on PART staking, an increase in PART prices would\ndirectly translate to a more significant source of funding for the project which\ncould, eventually, be used to expand the team with new members (developers and\nnon-developers), fund campaigns (i.e. marketing, user growth, etc), fund\npromotional efforts, and fund various budgets such as exchange listings, just as\nan example. This model has, in fact, exponential potential.\n\nOf course, before any expansion process beings, the first step is to fire up the\nengine once again and stabilize the new Particl internal structure. A team\nexpansion is a time-consuming process with various considerations and thus, is\nplanned for when the time will be suitable for it.\n\nAs a result of this new source of funding, you can expect the Particl project to\nbe back in the midst of action and be as strong, and even stronger, as it was at\nits peak. You can also expect a much faster pace of development, more frequent\ncommunication, more transparency, more promotional efforts, more marketing, more\nuser growth/adoption initiatives, and so on. This is the key to ensure Particl’s\nsuccess not only this year but in the many years that stand ahead of us all.\n\nSubmitted as a CCS Proposal\nThe team is currently implementing a better UI for the on-chain voting system in\nthe CCS system and it should go live in a week or two. That’ll allow you to\nbetter visualize the proposals, current voting, and etc.\n\nBecause this new treasury model changes the values of the yearly staking\ninterest rate as well as the percentage of all staking rewards being reserved\nfor the development and promotion of the Particl project, community consensus\nhas to be achieved at the protocol level to ensure an optimal level of\ndecentralization.\n\nAnother important point is that all the block rewards going to the treasury fund\nwill require an on-chain vote to be spent. Every quarter, the Particl team will\nsubmit a CCS proposal to have its budget approved by the community using\non-chain voting. This ultimately gives the community the final say, furthers the\nlevel of decentralization of the project (and its governance), and keeps the\nteam accountable to every PART holder to ensure it always acts in the best\ninterest of the ecosystem.\n\nFull Details Coming in a Separate Blog Post\nJust like with the information surrounding the proposed solutions for the\ninflationary bug, the precise details, figures, and in-depth information about\nthe treasury model proposal will be posted in a separate blog post that is\nlikely to go out next week on Particl News. Stay tuned as the team is in the\nprocess of finalizing all the details!\n\nAtomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop\nBut wait, there’s more being worked on! Over the past few months, a great\nsurprise has been cooking up and is now ready to be revealed; atomic swaps are\ncoming right to Particl Desktop thanks to a new Particl-based distributed\nexchange protocol.\n\nEarly Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)In fact,\nParticl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on BasicSwap, an anonymous DEX\nprotocol that uses SMSG to allow people to swap, without any third-party,\ncryptocurrencies using atomic swaps. BasicSwap is currently functional and is in\nits Closed Beta phase where various testers have been experimenting with it for\na few weeks. This anonymous DEX protocol, which currently supports Particl,\nMonero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin, has many benefits that will go a long way in\nmaking PART and other cryptocurrencies more resilient and widely accessible to\nall.\n\nIt uses Particl’s SMSG P2P network and the atomic swap protocol to allow you to\nexchange cryptocurrencies without requiring a third-party or wrapped assets. The\nswaps are pretty fast; in fact, swapping PART for LTC averages 20 to 25 minutes\nper swap (after both transactions are fully confirmed), which is also the same\nfor PART/XMR swaps. Of course, the actual time required for a swap to fully\ncomplete is entirely dependent on the confirmation times of the two coins being\ntraded.\n\nCompleted Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)To make it as easy\nto use as possible, the BasicSwap protocol will eventually be integrated into\nthe user interface of Particl Desktop. Swapping cryptocurrencies will be\npossible through a new Particl V3 “Swap” module and won’t require the syncing of\nother coin nodes.\n\nThis new atomic swap module isn’t planned to be released with the initial\nmainnet launch of Particl V3 but is expected to go live in one of the subsequent\nfew Particl Desktop updates that come after it. Even though this project is\ncurrently being delayed due to the commitment required from Particl Core\nDeveloper Tecnovert to fix the inflationary bug, BasicSwap is fully expected to\nbe accelerated by the potential funding provided by the new treasury model.\n\nKeep an eye out for an announcement of an Open Beta as well as more information\nabout this tool as soon as the Particl developers can get back to working on\ntheir previous tasks after the inflationary bug is dealt with. That should come\nshortly after the release of Particl V3 on mainnet.\n\nNew CCS Proposal\nA few weeks ago, a new proposal was added to the CCS system. Authored by Particl\ncommunity member ffmad, it proposes to fund the development and creation of a \nmarket API [https://github.com/particl/particl-market] (Particl V3)\ndocumentation. This proposal seeks to help anyone set up a market node and use\nit just like DeMarkets.io did with the explorer for Particl V2.\n\nThe requested donations are on the low end (1,200 PART), so if you’d like to\ncontribute, check out the proposal on the CCS here [https://ccs.particl.io/].\n\n> Note: The Particl node of the CCS will be updated next week, after which\nprevious proposals will be updated. This will also move this proposal from the\nIdea stage into the Funding Required stage.\nParticl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings\nCryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commitsCryptoMiso is a\nweb\nservice ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most\npopular Github repository.CryptoMisoBart Claeys [https://www.cryptomiso.com/]The\nYear 2020 has been a different one than previous years for the Particl project.\nThis is primarily because Particl kept most of its development in private\nrepositories as the team was working on the Particl V3 massive update. This\nmeant that only a tiny percentage of the progress was able to be publicly\ntracked on Github. Regardless, being a Bitcoin fork has many benefits for\nParticl, an obvious one being that it effectively leverages the entire\ndevelopment community of Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert constantly keeps the Particl code\nup-to-date with Bitcoin’s codebase. That means regularly pulling Bitcoin\nupdates, modifying the code to make it Particl compatible, and merging it\nwithout breaking anything else. This is obviously no small task, and this is\nreflected in CryptoMiso’s yearly Github commit leaderboard (2020), where Particl\nranked 4th in terms of the number of commits for the whole year! Particl\ncurrently ranks 5th in the past 12 months, and that doesn’t even take into\naccount the development made to the private repositories of Particl Desktop and\nthe BasicSwap DEX protocol.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Best is Yet to Come\nAlthough Particl is going through an unfortunate situation at this moment, it’s\nalso about to turn it into the best and most productive event since the\ninception of the project itself with the proposed new treasury model.\n\nWe understand that the current times can be challenging, but rest assured that\nthe best is yet to come! The team’s getting ready to fire up the engine full\nsteam ahead once again, scale back up, properly promote the project and its\nproducts, and come back into the midst of action with a strong bang!\n\nIt’s definitive. Things are looking very good in 2021 and the many years that\ncome after it! Particl is here to stay, and the best is yet to come\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This is primarily because Particl kept most of its development in private repositories as the team was working on the Particl V3 massive update. This meant that only a tiny percentage of the progress was able to be publicly tracked on Github. Regardless, being a Bitcoin fork has many benefits for Particl, an obvious one being that it effectively leverages the entire development community of Bitcoin.</p><p>In fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert constantly keeps the Particl code up-to-date with Bitcoin’s codebase. That means regularly pulling Bitcoin updates, modifying the code to make it Particl compatible, and merging it without breaking anything else. This is obviously no small task, and this is reflected in CryptoMiso’s yearly Github commit leaderboard (2020), where Particl ranked 4th in terms of the number of commits for the whole year! Particl currently ranks 5th in the past 12 months, and that doesn’t even take into account the development made to the private repositories of Particl Desktop and the BasicSwap DEX protocol.</p><hr><h1 id=\"the-best-is-yet-to-come\">The Best is Yet to Come</h1><p>Although Particl is going through an unfortunate situation at this moment, it’s also about to turn it into the best and most productive event since the inception of the project itself with the proposed new treasury model.</p><p>We understand that the current times can be challenging, but rest assured that the best is yet to come! The team’s getting ready to fire up the engine full steam ahead once again, scale back up, properly promote the project and its products, and come back into the midst of action with a strong bang!</p><p>It’s definitive. Things are looking very good in 2021 and the many years that come after it!

The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to whitelist outputs and undergoing a <strong>full RingCT and CT internal audit</strong> to ensure the code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.</p><p>Additionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a treasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the treasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next hardfork.</p><h3 id=\"legitimate-outputs-whitelisting-process\">Legitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process</h3><p>Users with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move them back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be possible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a process involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that category, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork a bit later on after the next one.</p><p>Here are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.</p><ol><li>A “<strong>low pass filter</strong>” will allow any output that contains a number of coins below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.</li><li>Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold will need to go through a <strong>manual claim process</strong> that will require them to prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team) and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on Particl News.</li></ol><p>As this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough time-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough time to do so.</p><h3 id=\"adjusted-total-supply-and-implications\">Adjusted Total Supply and Implications</h3><p>One of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which isn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the stealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is the one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted to its actual value in two different ways.</p><p>First off, <strong>the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their legitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter</strong>. Whenever a successful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect it and adjust its supply accordingly.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists outputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live</strong>. Any new coin being unfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.</p><p>What this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will be fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation supply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to range between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins (768,767 coins).</p><p>Please take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information the team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the team, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being slightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those numbers.</p><h3 id=\"other-implications\">Other Implications</h3><p>This inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.</p><ul><li><strong>An increase in staking rewards size</strong> will be observed. In fact, the size of rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example, the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.</li><li>Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the situation.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3 Update</h1><p>It can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the finalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led to a strain in time availability.

The swaps are pretty fast; in fact, swapping PART for LTC averages 20 to 25 minutes per swap (after both transactions are fully confirmed), which is also the same for PART/XMR swaps. Of course, the actual time required for a swap to fully complete is entirely dependent on the confirmation times of the two coins being traded.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R4iVnjkuTJLCC2feoqXc4qtc6MrJpVLqN3ELXtJBo1GmQT_2zwR7LvAY6I4fZ-NmL2-dryqYKYq2vgstKhLr556aAxr1w-6nqQEkb_NwStpaFphMoPORWRLcuzpfRj-EFwKsKQ8x\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Completed Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)</em></figcaption></figure><p>To make it as easy to use as possible, <strong>the BasicSwap protocol will eventually be integrated into the user interface of Particl Desktop</strong>.

Authored by Particl community member ffmad, it proposes to fund the development and creation of a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">market API</a> (Particl V3) documentation. This proposal seeks to help anyone set up a market node and use it just like DeMarkets.io did with the explorer for Particl V2.</p><p>The requested donations are on the low end (1,200 PART), so if you’d like to contribute, check out the proposal on the CCS <strong><a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\">here</a>.</strong></p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>The Particl node of the CCS will be updated next week, after which previous proposals will be updated. This will also move this proposal from the Idea stage into the Funding Required stage.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"particl-ends-2020-strongly-in-global-github-commit-rankings\">Particl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">CryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commits</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">CryptoMiso is a web service ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most popular Github repository.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">CryptoMiso</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Bart Claeys</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/assets/miso_fbshare.png\"></div></a></figure><p>The Year 2020 has been a different one than previous years for the Particl project. This is primarily because Particl kept most of its development in private repositories as the team was working on the Particl V3 massive update. This meant that only a tiny percentage of the progress was able to be publicly tracked on Github. Regardless, being a Bitcoin fork has many benefits for Particl, an obvious one being that it effectively leverages the entire development community of Bitcoin.</p><p>In fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert constantly keeps the Particl code up-to-date with Bitcoin’s codebase. That means regularly pulling Bitcoin updates, modifying the code to make it Particl compatible, and merging it without breaking anything else. This is obviously no small task, and this is reflected in CryptoMiso’s yearly Github commit leaderboard (2020), where Particl ranked 4th in terms of the number of commits for the whole year! Particl currently ranks 5th in the past 12 months, and that doesn’t even take into account the development made to the private repositories of Particl Desktop and the BasicSwap DEX protocol.</p><hr><h1 id=\"the-best-is-yet-to-come\">The Best is Yet to Come</h1><p>Although Particl is going through an unfortunate situation at this moment, it’s also about to turn it into the best and most productive event since the inception of the project itself with the proposed new treasury model.</p><p>We understand that the current times can be challenging, but rest assured that the best is yet to come! The team’s getting ready to fire up the engine full steam ahead once again, scale back up, properly promote the project and its products, and come back into the midst of action with a strong bang!</p><p>It’s definitive.

Ebenso ist ein kleiner Ausblick für 2021 -\nund sogar darüber hinaus - enthalten. \n\nKommen wir also gleich zur Sache!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInhalte\n * Die neuesten Informationen hinsichtlich der ungewollten Inflation und der\n   anvisierten Lösung\n * Particl V3: Ein Update\n * Ein Vorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung \n * Atomic Swaps im Particl Desktop\n * Ein neuer CCS Vorschlag\n * Particl ist auf Rang #5 in einem Vergleich aller Github Commits in 2020\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDie neuesten Informationen hinsichtlich der ungewollten Inflation und der\nanvisierten Lösung\nSeit der Bekanntmachung der ungewollten Inflation\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/] des PART Coins arbeitet\ndas Particl Team ohne Unterbrechung an verschiedenen Lösungsansätzen, um\nsicherzustellen, dass alle legitimen Outputs (anon) - die seit dem letzten\nHardfork geblockt sind - für die Besitzer wieder nutzbar zu machen. Unrechtmäßig\nerzeugte Outputs (anon) sollen dabei nicht konvertiert werden können und somit\ndauerhaft von der Verwendung blockiert bleiben. Hier nun einige Details zu\ndiesem Prozess sowie die Erläuterung der nächsten Schritte.\n\nDie nächsten Hardforks: Zeitplan\nRingCT- und CT-Überweisungen sind zurzeit nicht möglich. Das hat zur Folge, dass\ndie Benutzung des Particl Marketplace ebenfalls komplett blockiert ist, da diese\nÜberweisungsarten notwendig sind, um das Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem\n[https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-zwei-parteien-treuhand-system/] zu\nermöglichen und grundsätzlich alle Überweisungen zu verschleiern\n[https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-vertrauliche-transaktionen/]. Um die\nAuswirkungen dieser Sperre zu begrenzen (insbesondere die Veröffentlichung von\nParticl V3), hat sich das Team dazu entschieden, mehrere Forks zu planen,\nanstelle von zwei geplanten Forks (wie im vergangenen Blogpost kommuniziert).\n\nDer kommende Hardfork\nDer nächste Hardfork wird aller Voraussicht nach im April stattfinden. RingCT-\nund CT-Überweisungen werden entsperrt und darüber hinaus die Mehrheit der\nlegitimen RingCT-Outputs - (anon) Coins freigegeben. Sobald dieser Prozess\nabgeschlossen ist, wird dies auch die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 auf dem\nMainnet ermöglichen. \n\nAlle technischen Details des zweiten Hardforks kannst du via Github erhalten.\nLink: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\n\nHf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-coreSecond fork of\nexploit\nfix. RCT exploit fix. Hard fork 2 consensus changes: All frozen anon and blind\noutputs must be spent to plain with no blinded change. Blinding factor sum for\nCT txns is ...GitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81]\nAktuell ist das Gros der benötigten Vorraussetzungen für den Hardfork bereit, um\nveröffentlicht zu werden. Das Team ist momentan dabei, den Teil des Codes\nfertigzustellen, der anschliessend sicherstellt, dass alle legitimen\nRingCT-Outputs konvertiert werden können. Daneben wird simultan die interne \nÜberprüfung der Codebasis von RingCT und CT vorgenommen, um die Integrität der\nCodebasis für den Hardfork sicherzustellen. Des Weiteren gibt es einen separaten\nVorschlag (proposal) des Teams, um eine andauernde Mittelbereitstellung für das\nEntwicklerteam zu gewährleisten. Dieser Vorschlag wird weiter unten vorgestellt.\nSollte der Vorschlag für eine erweiterte Mittelbereitstellung Zustimmung finden,\nwird dies durch einen weiteren Hardfork aktiviert.\n\nKonvertierung legitimer RingCT-Outputs \nMit dem zweiten Hardfork wird ein Prozess in Gang gesetzt, um legitime\nvertrauliche (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins zu entsperren und in öffentlich\neinsehbare (public) Coins zu konvertieren. Die Mehrheit der Besitzer wird diesen\nVorgang direkt nach dem Hardfork initiieren können. In manchen Fällen kann es\njedoch notwendig sein, einige manuelle Schritte auszuführen. Für diese Fälle\nwird ein weiterer (dritter) Hardfork notwendig sein.\n\nWir möchten euch in der Folge zwei Verfahren an die Hand geben, mittels der ihr\nvertraulichen (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins entsperren könnt.\n\n 1. Ein sogenannter “low pass filter” ermöglicht, bestimmte Outputs, die nur\n    eine niedrige Anzahl an PART Coins enthalten und unter einem definierten\n    Grenzwert bleiben, direkt zu entsperren. Die Schwachstelle (bug) in Particls\n    Codebasis - die mittlerweile behoben ist - hat es dem Hacker erlaubt,\n    vergleichsweise große Outputs zu erzeugen, die deshalb nicht von diesem\n    Prozess betroffen sein können. Die genaue Höhe des Grenzwerts wird zeitnah\n    (in einem weiteren Blogpost) kommuniziert.\n 2. Besitzer, die legitime (anon) Coins haben, und über diesem Grenzwert liegen,\n    werden einen manuellen Prozess durchlaufen müssen, um ihre Coins zu\n    konvertieren. Dieser Prozess kann durch verschiedene Verfahren\n    bewerkstelligt und vom Nutzer selbst entschieden werden. Alle Forderungen\n    seitens der Besitzer, die über dem Grenzwert liegen, müssen mittels des CCS-\n    Systems (eine Vorlage wird vom Particl Team bereitgestellt werden)\n    vorgetragen und seitens der Community durch eine on-chain Abstimmung aller\n    Nutzer final bestätigt werden. Sobald eine Abstimmung durchgeführt worden\n    ist, werden die betroffenen Outputs mittels eines weiteren Hardforks im\n    Verlauf des Jahres final entsperrt. Diese Vorgehensweise erlaubt es den\n    Prozess so dezentral wie möglich zu organisieren und soll verhindern, dass\n    eine Partei (das Particl Team in diesem Fall) praktisch allein entscheiden\n    kann. Weitere Details werden in einem separaten Blogpost in ein bis zwei\n    Wochen kommuniziert.\n\nDie zweite Variante erfordert einige manuelle Eingaben seitens der betroffenen\nBesitzer. Insofern wird der dafür vorgesehene Zeitraum möglichst weit gefasst\nsein, sodass alle Betroffenen genug Zeit zur Verfügung haben, ihre legitimen\nCoins für sich zu beanspruchen.\n\nBerichtigung der Umlaufmenge (Gesamtsumme von PART) und die Konsequenzen\nEine der Folgen des Fehlers in der Software ist die ungewollte Erhöhung der\nUmlaufmenge von PART Coins, die aktuell noch nicht offiziell durch die\nBlockchain widergespiegelt wird. Aufgrund des verdeckten Charakters des Fehlers,\nwird die Umlaufmenge momentan so wiedergegeben, als ob es keinen Fehler und eine\nErhöhung der Umlaufmenge gegeben hätte. Eine Berichtigung wird zeitnah\nstattfinden, und die tatsächliche Menge auf zwei verschiedenen Wegen\nverifiziert.\n\nAls erstes wird sich die Umlaufmenge automatisch anpassen, sobald Besitzer ihre\nverdeckten (blind) und anonymen (anon) Coins mittels des low pass filters\nkonvertieren. Immer wenn eine Konvertierung erfolgreich stattgefunden hat, wird\ndiese auf der Blockchain angezeigt und dann Teil der legitimen Umlaufmenge sein.\n\nZweitens wird die Umlaufmenge angepasst werden, sobald der dritte Hardfork\nstattgefunden hat, der die legitimen Outputs durch Abstimmung der Community\nmittels des CCS-Systems bestätigt. Alle innerhalb dieses Prozesses entsperrten\nOutputs gehören in der Folge zur neuen legitimen Umlaufmenge.\n\nDas bedeutet, dass am Ende dieses Prozesses, die neu angezeigte Umlaufmenge\nkomplett dem tatsächlichen Wert nach der aufgetretenen Inflation entspricht. Das\nTeam geht im Moment davon aus, dass insgesamt zwischen 1,5 Millionen bis 2\nMillionen PART aufgrund des Fehlers künstlich in Umlauf gebracht worden sind.\nDiese Menge versteht sich inklusive der bereits bestätigten 768.767 PART.  Bitte\nbeachtet, dass es sich hierbei um eine grobe Schätzung handelt, die das Team\naufgrund verschiedener Informationen, die seit dem ersten Hardfork gesammelt\nwerden konnten, annimmt. Die finale Umlaufmenge ist möglicherweise etwas höher\noder etwas niedriger, und wird sich zwischen den bereits genannten Zahlen\neinpendeln.\n\nWeitere Konsequenzen\nDer aufgetretene Fehler hat darüber hinaus weitere Konsequenzen für das\nNetzwerk:\n\n * Eine Erhöhung der Staking-Rewards wird feststellbar sein. Die Höhe der\n   Belohnung wird im Verhältnis der erhöhten Umlaufmenge widergespiegelt. Da\n   Staking-Belohnungen auf einem prozentualen Anteil an der Umlaufmenge\n   basieren, und sollte sich die Umlaufmenge um beispielsweise 15% erhöht haben,\n   erhöhen sich die Staking-Rewards ebenfalls um diesen Prozentsatz.\n * Andere Crypto Projekte, die Particls RingCT-Implementierung per offiziellem\n   Fork übernommen haben, wurden vor der öffentlichen Bekanntmachung vertraulich\n   kontaktiert und über den Fehler informiert. Das Veil Projekt hat feststellen\n   können, dass sie nicht von dem Problem betroffen sind, da sie eine andere\n   Methode zur Implementierung genutzt haben. Ghost musste feststellen, dass sie\n   betroffen sind, und haben daraufhin umgehend das Problem beseitigt. Wir\n   möchten uns bei beiden Teams für die Unterstützung und die sofortige Lösung\n   der delikaten Situation bedanken.\n\nParticl V3: Update\nEs kann berichtet werden, dass sich die Fertigstellung von Particl V3 in den\nletzten Wochen aufgrund persönlicher Probleme, die zu Lasten der zeitlichen\nVerfügbarkeit führten, deutlich verlangsamt hat. Dies wird gerade behoben und\nwir erwarten, dass die Entwicklung von Particl V3 und Particl Desktop in den\nnächsten Tagen wieder im gewohnten Tempo (und wahrscheinlich sogar schneller als\nbisher) fortgesetzt wird.\n\nAus diesem Grund haben wir heute kein spezifisches Update hinsichtlich Particl\nV3. Wir rechnen aber fest damit, einen Bericht zum aktuellen Stand der\nEntwicklung vor dem kommenden Blogpost im April veröffentlichen zu können. Wir\nrechnen ebenfalls damit, vor dem nächsten Projektupdate eine neue\nTestnet-Version veröffentlichen zu können. \n\nVorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung\nWie bereits vor einiger Zeit seitens der Particl Foundation kommuniziert wurde\n[https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement], sind die letzten Zahlungen\nan externe Auftragnehmer (dies schliesst unsere Entwickler ein) gezahlt worden.\nDa die Geldmittel der Particl Foundation praktisch aufgebraucht sind, wird das\nEnde der bisherigen Funktion eingeleitet.\n\nAus diesem Grund empfängt das Particl-Team keine Gehälter mehr, bis eine neue\nLösung gefunden wird, finanzielle Mittel für die Entwicklung am Particl\nMarketplace zu erhalten. Momentan werden alle Arbeiten ohne Bezahlung und\nfreiwillig erbracht. Dies führt leider zu einer erheblichen Reduzierung der\nzeitlichen Verfügbarkeit der meisten Teammitglieder, da andere temporäre\nVerpflichtungen eingegangen werden müssen, um über die Runden zu kommen.\n\nDennoch stehen wir kurz vor der Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 und damit der\nwichtigsten Erweiterung für den Particl Marketplace seit seiner Entstehung. Ein\nProblem stellt momentan ein Mangel an finanziellen Mitteln dar, um die\nwegweisende Veröffentlichung auch angemessene zu vermarkten. Die Korrelation aus\nmangelnden Mitteln für die Entwicklung als auch die Vermarktung haben uns\nmotiviert, an einer Lösung zu arbeiten, die das Projekt langfristig und\nnachhaltig finanziert und eine verlässliche Mittelbereitstellung garantiert.\n\nDas neue Modell für die Finanzmittelbeschaffung erfindet das Rad nicht neu.\nAllerdings würde es dem Particl-Team helfen, dauerhaft an der Weiterentwicklung\nvon Particl zu arbeiten, und dabei nur marginal in die bestehenden Strukturen\neingreifen, diese aber deutlich optimieren. Das Particl-Team richtet sich bei\ndem Entwurf der Finanzmittelbeschaffung nach erfolgreichen Projekten wie bspw.\nDecred und Siacoin, die vergleichbaren Modelle ausgewählt und damit erfolgreich\nwirtschaften konnten.\n\nWas können wir erwarten?\nWährend die Zahlen rund um die neue Finanzverwaltung noch simuliert und\nausgewertet werden, könnte diese die sofortige Vollfinanzierung des\nParticl-Teams zu den aktuellen Preisen ermöglichen und genügend Mittel für\nverschiedene Budgets bereitstellen, die auf die Unterstützung und Förderung des\nProjekts sowie die Erhöhung des Nutzerwachstums ausgerichtet sind.\n\nDa die neue Finanzmittelbeschaffung wesentlich vom Staking und dem Preis von\nPART abhängt, kann eine etwaige Erhöhung des PART-Preises ebenfalls dazu\nbeitragen, dass zusätzliche Mittel zur Verfügung stehen, um das Team zu\nerweitern und Kampagnen zu initiieren, die die Bekanntheit und Nutzerbasis des\nParticl Marketplace vergrößern und ggf. auch Listings bei anderen Kryptobörsen\n ermöglichen. \n\nEs sollte jedoch eingeschränkt werden, dass eine Erweiterung des Teams erst\nmöglich sein wird, wenn wir wieder eine stabile Struktur innerhalb des\nParticl-Teams etabliert haben. Eine Erweiterung ist grundsätzlich ein\nzeitaufwendiger Prozess, der erst in Betracht gezogen wird, wenn es die Zeit\nerlaubt.\n\nAls eine Folge der neuen Finanzmittelbeschaffung könnte das Particl Projekt bald\nwieder in alter Stärke auftrumpfen, womöglich sogar etwas stärker als gewohnt.\nWir erwarten, dass sowohl die Entwicklung selbst als auch die öffentliche\nKommunikation deutlich verbessert werden können und dabei weder Transparenz,\nMarketing, eine Steigerung der Nutzerbasis, Werbemaßnahmen und viele andere\nInitiativen auf der Strecke bleiben. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, Particl nicht\nnur kurzfristig, sondern vor allem für die Zukunft aufzustellen.\n\nDie Finanzmittelbeschaffung als CCS Proposal\nDas Particl-Team arbeitet zurzeit daran, eine bessere Benutzerschnittstelle (UI)\nfür das sogenannte on-Chain Abstimmungsverfahren fertigzustellen. Dieses soll in\nden kommenden 1-2 Wochen fertig sein. Es wird uns erlauben, die Vorschläge\nansprechend zu visualisieren und das Abstimmungsverfahren einzubauen.\n\nDa das neue Finanzmittelbeschaffungsmodell die Staking-Rewards sowie den Anteil,\nder für die Entwicklung und weitere Werbemaßnahmen reserviert ist, anhebt, liegt\ndie oberste Priorität darin, dass die Particl-Community hierzu abstimmt und auf\nder Protokoll-Ebene zu einer Einigung in der Sache kommt.\n\nEin weiterer wichtiger Aspekt besteht darin, Prozesse deutlich transparenter zu\ngestalten. Das bedeutet, dass die Finanzmittelverwaltung ebenfalls via on-Chain\nAbstimmung bestätigt wird. Jedes Quartal wird deshalb seitens des Particl-Teams\nein CCS Vorschlag unterbreitet, der daraufhin von der Particl-Community auf der\nProtokoll-Ebene bestätigt oder abgelehnt wird. Salopp formuliert soll dieser\nProzess sicherstellen, dass die Particl-Community das letzte Wort darüber hat,\nin welche Richtung es geht. Dabei sollen Transparenz, Dezentralisierung und\nGovernance (Kontroll- und Steuerungsstruktur) die Eckpfeiler darstellen, um das\nParticl-Team rechenschaftspflichtig gegenüber der Community zu machen und stets\nim besten Interesse des gesamten Ökosystem zu handeln.\n\nWeitere Informationen zu diesem wegweisenden Schritt in die Zukunft von Particl\nwerden in einem weiteren Blogpost zeitnah veröffentlicht. Hier werden dann auch\ndie genauen Details, Zahlen und alle weiteren wichtigen Informationen und\nGedanken zum Proposal (Vorschlag) der neuen Finanzverwaltung kommuniziert. \n\nAtomic Swaps im Particl Desktop\nDoch das ist noch nicht alles. In den letzten Monaten wurde an einem\nÜberraschungs-Projekt gearbeitet, das wir heute offiziell zeigen. Dank eines\nneuen Particl basierten Austauschprotokolls, kommen Atomic Swaps direkt in den\nParticl Desktop.\n\nEarly Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)Teconvert,\nunser Particl Core Entwickler, hat BasicSwap entworfen, ein anonymes\nDEX-Protokoll, dass es mittels SMSG erlaubt, anonym und ohne dritte\nErfüllungsgehilfen Kryptowährungen durch Atomic Swaps zu tauschen. BasicSwap\nfunktioniert einwandfrei und wurde in einer geschlossenen Beta-Testphase bereits\nseit Wochen ausprobiert. Das DEX-Prokoll unterstützt momentan Particl, Monero,\nBitcoin, and Litecoin, und macht den Handel mit Kryptowährungen\nwiderstandsfähiger und vor allem für jeden zugänglich.\n\nBasicSwap nutzt Particls SMSG P2P-Netzwerk und ein eigenes Atomic\nSwap-Protokoll, dass es euch ermöglicht, Kryptowährungen direkt zu tauschen,\nohne dass dabei eine weitere Partei benötigt wird oder andere \"Wrapped Coins\"\nzum Einsatz kommen. Die Swaps werden relativ schnell durchgeführt, sodass ein\nTausch zwischen PART und LTC (oder auch PART und XMR) zwischen 20-25 Minuten\nbenötigt. Die individuell benötigte Zeit für den kompletten Vorgang variiert und\nhängt von den Block-Bestätigungszeiten der jeweiligen Kryptowährungen ab. \n\nCompleted Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)Um das alles so\neinfach wie möglich zu gestalten, wird BasicSwap direkt in den Particl Desktop\nintegriert. BasicSwap wird jedoch noch etwas Entwicklungszeit benötigen und\ndaher nicht direkt mit Particl V3 veröffentlicht werden, sondern etwas später,\nbei einem der darauffolgenden Updates. Obwohl die aktuelle Situation dazu\ngeführt hat, dass dieses Projekt nicht an erster Stelle in Tecnoverts\nAufgabenliste steht, erwarten wir, dass BasicSwap die neue Mittelbereitstellung\n(die wir weiter oben vorgestellt haben) noch weiter verbessert.\n\nEin neuer CCS Vorschlag\nVor einigen Wochen wurde eine neuer CCS Vorschlag von ffmad (Community-Mitglied)\nvorgestellt, der die Entwicklung einer Market API\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market] (Particl V3) Dokumentation zum Ziel\nhat. Dieser Vorschlag soll es Nutzern erleichtern, eine Market Node zu\ninitiieren, die nach dem Vorbild von DeMarkets.io für Particl V2 funktioniert.\n\nCheckt den Vorschlag von ffmad hier\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/market%20api%20documentation.html] und\nunterstützt diesen, sollte euch das Anliegen einer Market API Dokumentation\nwichtig sein. Die aufgerufene Summe beträgt 1.200 PART. \n\nParticl ist auf Rang #5 in einem Vergleich aller Github Commits in 2020\nCryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commitsCryptoMiso is a\nweb\nservice ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most\npopular Github repository.CryptoMisoBart Claeys [https://www.cryptomiso.com/]\n2020 war mit Sicherheit kein ganz gewöhnliches Jahr für Particl. Das hat hängt\nbesonders damit zusammen, dass ein Großteil der Entwicklung am Marketplace\nhinter verschlossenen Türen aka privaten Repos stattgefunden hat. Das hatte zur\nFolge, dass nur ein äußerst kleiner Teil des Fortschritts öffentlich auf Github\neinsehbar war. Als Fork von Bitcoin kommt Particl dennoch in den Genuss den\nFortschritt und die Arbeit der Entwicklergemeinde an Bitcoin zu integrieren und\nund für Particls Codebasis zu übernehmen.\n\nTecnovert ist Particls Versicherung dafür, dass die Codebasis von Particl immer\nmit Bitcoin standhält. Dass das jedoch kein einfaches Kopieren ist, sollte allen\nklar sein, da die Updates sorgfältig modifiziert und mit Particls Blockchain\nharmonisiert werden müssen, ohne dabei irgendwelche Probleme und Bugs zu\nkreieren. Diese Arbeit spiegelt sich in dem von CryptoMiso jährlich\nherausgegebenen Ranking aller Github Commits wider. Particl liegt auf einem\näußerst respektablen 5. Platz in den vergangenen 12 Monaten, ohne dabei\nüberhaupt alle Entwicklungsfortschritte, die in nicht-öffentlichen Repos oder an\nBasicSwap stattgefunden haben, hinzu zu zählen.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Best is Yet to Come\nAuch wenn die aktuelle Situation nicht einfach erscheint, schauen wir\nzuversichtlich in die Zukunft von Particl und sind uns sicher, dass wir mit den\nhier skizzierten Schritten das Ruder umreißen und die bis dato erfolgreichste\nZeit des Particl Projects einleiten können.\n\nThe best is yet to come! Da sind wir uns alle sicher, und hoffen, dass wir euch\nmit dem Update Lust auf mehr in 2021 und die Zeit danach geben konnten. Wir sind\nbereit und hoffen, ihr seid dabei, wenn die Action in den kommenden Monaten\nrichtig abgeht.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl ist Partizipieren\nSei ein Kümmerer.

Unrechtmäßig erzeugte Outputs (anon) sollen dabei nicht konvertiert werden können und somit dauerhaft von der Verwendung blockiert bleiben. Hier nun einige Details zu diesem Prozess sowie die Erläuterung der nächsten Schritte.</p><h3 id=\"die-n-chsten-hardforks-zeitplan\">Die nächsten Hardforks: Zeitplan</h3><p>RingCT- und CT-Überweisungen sind zurzeit nicht möglich. Das hat zur Folge, dass die Benutzung des Particl Marketplace ebenfalls komplett blockiert ist, da diese Überweisungsarten notwendig sind, um das <a href=\"https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-zwei-parteien-treuhand-system/\">Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem</a> zu ermöglichen und grundsätzlich alle <a href=\"https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-vertrauliche-transaktionen/\">Überweisungen zu verschleiern</a>. Um die Auswirkungen dieser Sperre zu begrenzen (insbesondere die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3), hat sich das Team dazu entschieden, mehrere Forks zu planen, anstelle von zwei geplanten Forks (wie im vergangenen Blogpost kommuniziert).</p><h3 id=\"der-kommende-hardfork\">Der kommende Hardfork</h3><p>Der nächste Hardfork wird aller Voraussicht nach im April stattfinden. RingCT- und CT-Überweisungen werden entsperrt und darüber hinaus die Mehrheit der legitimen RingCT-Outputs - (anon) Coins freigegeben. Sobald dieser Prozess abgeschlossen ist, wird dies auch die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 auf dem Mainnet ermöglichen. </p><p>Alle technischen Details des zweiten Hardforks kannst du via Github erhalten.

Das Team ist momentan dabei, den Teil des Codes fertigzustellen, der anschliessend sicherstellt, dass alle legitimen RingCT-Outputs konvertiert werden können. Daneben wird simultan die interne <strong>Überprüfung der Codebasis von RingCT und CT</strong> vorgenommen, um die Integrität der Codebasis für den Hardfork sicherzustellen. Des Weiteren gibt es einen separaten Vorschlag (proposal) des Teams, um eine andauernde Mittelbereitstellung für das Entwicklerteam zu gewährleisten. Dieser Vorschlag wird weiter unten vorgestellt. Sollte der Vorschlag für eine erweiterte Mittelbereitstellung Zustimmung finden, wird dies durch einen weiteren Hardfork aktiviert.</p><h3 id=\"konvertierung-legitimer-ringct-outputs\">Konvertierung legitimer RingCT-Outputs </h3><p>Mit dem zweiten Hardfork wird ein Prozess in Gang gesetzt, um legitime vertrauliche (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins zu entsperren und in öffentlich einsehbare (public) Coins zu konvertieren. Die Mehrheit der Besitzer wird diesen Vorgang direkt nach dem Hardfork initiieren können. In manchen Fällen kann es jedoch notwendig sein, einige manuelle Schritte auszuführen. Für diese Fälle wird ein weiterer (dritter) Hardfork notwendig sein.</p><p>Wir möchten euch in der Folge zwei Verfahren an die Hand geben, mittels der ihr vertraulichen (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins entsperren könnt.</p><ol><li>Ein sogenannter “<strong><strong>low pass filter</strong></strong>” ermöglicht, bestimmte Outputs, die nur eine niedrige Anzahl an PART Coins enthalten und unter einem definierten Grenzwert bleiben, direkt zu entsperren. Die Schwachstelle (bug) in Particls Codebasis - die mittlerweile behoben ist - hat es dem Hacker erlaubt, vergleichsweise große Outputs zu erzeugen, die deshalb nicht von diesem Prozess betroffen sein können. Die genaue Höhe des Grenzwerts wird zeitnah (in einem weiteren Blogpost) kommuniziert.</li><li>Besitzer, die legitime (anon) Coins haben, und über diesem Grenzwert liegen, werden einen <strong>manuellen Prozess</strong> durchlaufen müssen, um ihre Coins zu konvertieren. Dieser Prozess kann durch verschiedene Verfahren bewerkstelligt und vom Nutzer selbst entschieden werden. Alle Forderungen seitens der Besitzer, die über dem Grenzwert liegen, müssen mittels des CCS- Systems (eine Vorlage wird vom Particl Team bereitgestellt werden) vorgetragen und seitens der Community durch eine on-chain Abstimmung aller Nutzer final bestätigt werden. Sobald eine Abstimmung durchgeführt worden ist, werden die betroffenen Outputs mittels eines weiteren Hardforks im Verlauf des Jahres final entsperrt. Diese Vorgehensweise erlaubt es den Prozess so dezentral wie möglich zu organisieren und soll verhindern, dass eine Partei (das Particl Team in diesem Fall) praktisch allein entscheiden kann. Weitere Details werden in einem separaten Blogpost in ein bis zwei Wochen kommuniziert.</li></ol><p>Die zweite Variante erfordert einige manuelle Eingaben seitens der betroffenen Besitzer. Insofern wird der dafür vorgesehene Zeitraum möglichst weit gefasst sein, sodass alle Betroffenen genug Zeit zur Verfügung haben, ihre legitimen Coins für sich zu beanspruchen.</p><h3 id=\"berichtigung-der-umlaufmenge-gesamtsumme-von-part-und-die-konsequenzen\">Berichtigung der Umlaufmenge (Gesamtsumme von PART) und die Konsequenzen</h3><p>Eine der Folgen des Fehlers in der Software ist die ungewollte Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge von PART Coins, die aktuell noch nicht offiziell durch die Blockchain widergespiegelt wird. Aufgrund des verdeckten Charakters des Fehlers, wird die Umlaufmenge momentan so wiedergegeben, als ob es keinen Fehler und eine Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge gegeben hätte. Eine Berichtigung wird zeitnah stattfinden, und die tatsächliche Menge auf zwei verschiedenen Wegen verifiziert.</p><p><strong>Als erstes wird sich die Umlaufmenge automatisch anpassen, sobald Besitzer ihre verdeckten (blind) und anonymen (anon) Coins mittels des low pass filters konvertieren</strong>. Immer wenn eine Konvertierung erfolgreich stattgefunden hat, wird diese auf der Blockchain angezeigt und dann Teil der legitimen Umlaufmenge sein.</p><p><strong>Zweitens wird die Umlaufmenge angepasst werden, sobald der dritte Hardfork stattgefunden hat, der die legitimen Outputs durch Abstimmung der Community mittels des CCS-Systems bestätigt</strong>. Alle innerhalb dieses Prozesses entsperrten Outputs gehören in der Folge zur neuen legitimen Umlaufmenge.</p><p>Das bedeutet, dass am Ende dieses Prozesses, die neu angezeigte Umlaufmenge komplett dem tatsächlichen Wert nach der aufgetretenen Inflation entspricht. Das Team geht im Moment davon aus, dass insgesamt zwischen 1,5 Millionen bis 2 Millionen PART aufgrund des Fehlers künstlich in Umlauf gebracht worden sind. Diese Menge versteht sich inklusive der bereits bestätigten 768.767 PART.  Bitte beachtet, dass es sich hierbei um eine grobe Schätzung handelt, die das Team aufgrund verschiedener Informationen, die seit dem ersten Hardfork gesammelt werden konnten, annimmt. Die finale Umlaufmenge ist möglicherweise etwas höher oder etwas niedriger, und wird sich zwischen den bereits genannten Zahlen einpendeln.</p><h3 id=\"weitere-konsequenzen\">Weitere Konsequenzen</h3><p>Der aufgetretene Fehler hat darüber hinaus weitere Konsequenzen für das Netzwerk:</p><ul><li><strong>Eine Erhöhung der Staking-Rewards wird feststellbar sein</strong>. Die Höhe der Belohnung wird im Verhältnis der erhöhten Umlaufmenge widergespiegelt. Da Staking-Belohnungen auf einem prozentualen Anteil an der Umlaufmenge basieren, und sollte sich die Umlaufmenge um beispielsweise 15% erhöht haben, erhöhen sich die Staking-Rewards ebenfalls um diesen Prozentsatz.</li><li>Andere Crypto Projekte, die Particls RingCT-Implementierung per offiziellem Fork übernommen haben, wurden vor der öffentlichen Bekanntmachung vertraulich kontaktiert und über den Fehler informiert. Das Veil Projekt hat feststellen können, dass sie nicht von dem Problem betroffen sind, da sie eine andere Methode zur Implementierung genutzt haben. Ghost musste feststellen, dass sie betroffen sind, und haben daraufhin umgehend das Problem beseitigt. Wir möchten uns bei beiden Teams für die Unterstützung und die sofortige Lösung der delikaten Situation bedanken.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3: Update</h1><p>Es kann berichtet werden, dass sich die Fertigstellung von Particl V3 in den letzten Wochen aufgrund persönlicher Probleme, die zu Lasten der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit führten, deutlich verlangsamt hat. Dies wird gerade behoben und wir erwarten, dass die Entwicklung von Particl V3 und Particl Desktop in den nächsten Tagen wieder im gewohnten Tempo (und wahrscheinlich sogar schneller als bisher) fortgesetzt wird.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund haben wir heute kein spezifisches Update hinsichtlich Particl V3. Wir rechnen aber fest damit, einen Bericht zum aktuellen Stand der Entwicklung vor dem kommenden Blogpost im April veröffentlichen zu können. Wir rechnen ebenfalls damit, vor dem nächsten Projektupdate eine neue Testnet-Version veröffentlichen zu können. </p><h1 id=\"vorschlag-f-r-eine-verbesserte-und-nachhaltige-finanzverwaltung\">Vorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung</h1><p>Wie bereits vor einiger Zeit <a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">seitens der Particl Foundation kommuniziert wurde</a>, sind die letzten Zahlungen an externe Auftragnehmer (dies schliesst unsere Entwickler ein) gezahlt worden. Da die Geldmittel der Particl Foundation praktisch aufgebraucht sind, <strong>wird das Ende der bisherigen Funktion eingeleitet</strong>.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund empfängt das Particl-Team keine Gehälter mehr, bis eine neue Lösung gefunden wird, finanzielle Mittel für die Entwicklung am Particl Marketplace zu erhalten. Momentan werden alle Arbeiten ohne Bezahlung und freiwillig erbracht. Dies führt leider zu einer erheblichen Reduzierung der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit der meisten Teammitglieder, da andere temporäre Verpflichtungen eingegangen werden müssen, um über die Runden zu kommen.</p><p>Dennoch stehen wir kurz vor der Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 und damit der wichtigsten Erweiterung für den Particl Marketplace seit seiner Entstehung. Ein Problem stellt momentan ein Mangel an finanziellen Mitteln dar, um die wegweisende Veröffentlichung auch angemessene zu vermarkten.

Unrechtmäßig erzeugte Outputs (anon) sollen dabei nicht konvertiert werden können und somit dauerhaft von der Verwendung blockiert bleiben. Hier nun einige Details zu diesem Prozess sowie die Erläuterung der nächsten Schritte.</p><h3 id=\"die-n-chsten-hardforks-zeitplan\">Die nächsten Hardforks: Zeitplan</h3><p>RingCT- und CT-Überweisungen sind zurzeit nicht möglich. Das hat zur Folge, dass die Benutzung des Particl Marketplace ebenfalls komplett blockiert ist, da diese Überweisungsarten notwendig sind, um das <a href=\"https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-zwei-parteien-treuhand-system/\">Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem</a> zu ermöglichen und grundsätzlich alle <a href=\"https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-vertrauliche-transaktionen/\">Überweisungen zu verschleiern</a>. Um die Auswirkungen dieser Sperre zu begrenzen (insbesondere die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3), hat sich das Team dazu entschieden, mehrere Forks zu planen, anstelle von zwei geplanten Forks (wie im vergangenen Blogpost kommuniziert).</p><h3 id=\"der-kommende-hardfork\">Der kommende Hardfork</h3><p>Der nächste Hardfork wird aller Voraussicht nach im April stattfinden. RingCT- und CT-Überweisungen werden entsperrt und darüber hinaus die Mehrheit der legitimen RingCT-Outputs - (anon) Coins freigegeben. Sobald dieser Prozess abgeschlossen ist, wird dies auch die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 auf dem Mainnet ermöglichen. </p><p>Alle technischen Details des zweiten Hardforks kannst du via Github erhalten.

Das Team ist momentan dabei, den Teil des Codes fertigzustellen, der anschliessend sicherstellt, dass alle legitimen RingCT-Outputs konvertiert werden können. Daneben wird simultan die interne <strong>Überprüfung der Codebasis von RingCT und CT</strong> vorgenommen, um die Integrität der Codebasis für den Hardfork sicherzustellen. Des Weiteren gibt es einen separaten Vorschlag (proposal) des Teams, um eine andauernde Mittelbereitstellung für das Entwicklerteam zu gewährleisten. Dieser Vorschlag wird weiter unten vorgestellt. Sollte der Vorschlag für eine erweiterte Mittelbereitstellung Zustimmung finden, wird dies durch einen weiteren Hardfork aktiviert.</p><h3 id=\"konvertierung-legitimer-ringct-outputs\">Konvertierung legitimer RingCT-Outputs </h3><p>Mit dem zweiten Hardfork wird ein Prozess in Gang gesetzt, um legitime vertrauliche (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins zu entsperren und in öffentlich einsehbare (public) Coins zu konvertieren. Die Mehrheit der Besitzer wird diesen Vorgang direkt nach dem Hardfork initiieren können. In manchen Fällen kann es jedoch notwendig sein, einige manuelle Schritte auszuführen. Für diese Fälle wird ein weiterer (dritter) Hardfork notwendig sein.</p><p>Wir möchten euch in der Folge zwei Verfahren an die Hand geben, mittels der ihr vertraulichen (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins entsperren könnt.</p><ol><li>Ein sogenannter “<strong><strong>low pass filter</strong></strong>” ermöglicht, bestimmte Outputs, die nur eine niedrige Anzahl an PART Coins enthalten und unter einem definierten Grenzwert bleiben, direkt zu entsperren. Die Schwachstelle (bug) in Particls Codebasis - die mittlerweile behoben ist - hat es dem Hacker erlaubt, vergleichsweise große Outputs zu erzeugen, die deshalb nicht von diesem Prozess betroffen sein können. Die genaue Höhe des Grenzwerts wird zeitnah (in einem weiteren Blogpost) kommuniziert.</li><li>Besitzer, die legitime (anon) Coins haben, und über diesem Grenzwert liegen, werden einen <strong>manuellen Prozess</strong> durchlaufen müssen, um ihre Coins zu konvertieren. Dieser Prozess kann durch verschiedene Verfahren bewerkstelligt und vom Nutzer selbst entschieden werden. Alle Forderungen seitens der Besitzer, die über dem Grenzwert liegen, müssen mittels des CCS- Systems (eine Vorlage wird vom Particl Team bereitgestellt werden) vorgetragen und seitens der Community durch eine on-chain Abstimmung aller Nutzer final bestätigt werden. Sobald eine Abstimmung durchgeführt worden ist, werden die betroffenen Outputs mittels eines weiteren Hardforks im Verlauf des Jahres final entsperrt. Diese Vorgehensweise erlaubt es den Prozess so dezentral wie möglich zu organisieren und soll verhindern, dass eine Partei (das Particl Team in diesem Fall) praktisch allein entscheiden kann. Weitere Details werden in einem separaten Blogpost in ein bis zwei Wochen kommuniziert.</li></ol><p>Die zweite Variante erfordert einige manuelle Eingaben seitens der betroffenen Besitzer. Insofern wird der dafür vorgesehene Zeitraum möglichst weit gefasst sein, sodass alle Betroffenen genug Zeit zur Verfügung haben, ihre legitimen Coins für sich zu beanspruchen.</p><h3 id=\"berichtigung-der-umlaufmenge-gesamtsumme-von-part-und-die-konsequenzen\">Berichtigung der Umlaufmenge (Gesamtsumme von PART) und die Konsequenzen</h3><p>Eine der Folgen des Fehlers in der Software ist die ungewollte Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge von PART Coins, die aktuell noch nicht offiziell durch die Blockchain widergespiegelt wird. Aufgrund des verdeckten Charakters des Fehlers, wird die Umlaufmenge momentan so wiedergegeben, als ob es keinen Fehler und eine Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge gegeben hätte. Eine Berichtigung wird zeitnah stattfinden, und die tatsächliche Menge auf zwei verschiedenen Wegen verifiziert.</p><p><strong>Als erstes wird sich die Umlaufmenge automatisch anpassen, sobald Besitzer ihre verdeckten (blind) und anonymen (anon) Coins mittels des low pass filters konvertieren</strong>. Immer wenn eine Konvertierung erfolgreich stattgefunden hat, wird diese auf der Blockchain angezeigt und dann Teil der legitimen Umlaufmenge sein.</p><p><strong>Zweitens wird die Umlaufmenge angepasst werden, sobald der dritte Hardfork stattgefunden hat, der die legitimen Outputs durch Abstimmung der Community mittels des CCS-Systems bestätigt</strong>. Alle innerhalb dieses Prozesses entsperrten Outputs gehören in der Folge zur neuen legitimen Umlaufmenge.</p><p>Das bedeutet, dass am Ende dieses Prozesses, die neu angezeigte Umlaufmenge komplett dem tatsächlichen Wert nach der aufgetretenen Inflation entspricht. Das Team geht im Moment davon aus, dass insgesamt zwischen 1,5 Millionen bis 2 Millionen PART aufgrund des Fehlers künstlich in Umlauf gebracht worden sind. Diese Menge versteht sich inklusive der bereits bestätigten 768.767 PART.  Bitte beachtet, dass es sich hierbei um eine grobe Schätzung handelt, die das Team aufgrund verschiedener Informationen, die seit dem ersten Hardfork gesammelt werden konnten, annimmt. Die finale Umlaufmenge ist möglicherweise etwas höher oder etwas niedriger, und wird sich zwischen den bereits genannten Zahlen einpendeln.</p><h3 id=\"weitere-konsequenzen\">Weitere Konsequenzen</h3><p>Der aufgetretene Fehler hat darüber hinaus weitere Konsequenzen für das Netzwerk:</p><ul><li><strong>Eine Erhöhung der Staking-Rewards wird feststellbar sein</strong>. Die Höhe der Belohnung wird im Verhältnis der erhöhten Umlaufmenge widergespiegelt. Da Staking-Belohnungen auf einem prozentualen Anteil an der Umlaufmenge basieren, und sollte sich die Umlaufmenge um beispielsweise 15% erhöht haben, erhöhen sich die Staking-Rewards ebenfalls um diesen Prozentsatz.</li><li>Andere Crypto Projekte, die Particls RingCT-Implementierung per offiziellem Fork übernommen haben, wurden vor der öffentlichen Bekanntmachung vertraulich kontaktiert und über den Fehler informiert. Das Veil Projekt hat feststellen können, dass sie nicht von dem Problem betroffen sind, da sie eine andere Methode zur Implementierung genutzt haben. Ghost musste feststellen, dass sie betroffen sind, und haben daraufhin umgehend das Problem beseitigt. Wir möchten uns bei beiden Teams für die Unterstützung und die sofortige Lösung der delikaten Situation bedanken.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3: Update</h1><p>Es kann berichtet werden, dass sich die Fertigstellung von Particl V3 in den letzten Wochen aufgrund persönlicher Probleme, die zu Lasten der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit führten, deutlich verlangsamt hat. Dies wird gerade behoben und wir erwarten, dass die Entwicklung von Particl V3 und Particl Desktop in den nächsten Tagen wieder im gewohnten Tempo (und wahrscheinlich sogar schneller als bisher) fortgesetzt wird.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund haben wir heute kein spezifisches Update hinsichtlich Particl V3. Wir rechnen aber fest damit, einen Bericht zum aktuellen Stand der Entwicklung vor dem kommenden Blogpost im April veröffentlichen zu können. Wir rechnen ebenfalls damit, vor dem nächsten Projektupdate eine neue Testnet-Version veröffentlichen zu können. </p><h1 id=\"vorschlag-f-r-eine-verbesserte-und-nachhaltige-finanzverwaltung\">Vorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung</h1><p>Wie bereits vor einiger Zeit <a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">seitens der Particl Foundation kommuniziert wurde</a>, sind die letzten Zahlungen an externe Auftragnehmer (dies schliesst unsere Entwickler ein) gezahlt worden. Da die Geldmittel der Particl Foundation praktisch aufgebraucht sind, <strong>wird das Ende der bisherigen Funktion eingeleitet</strong>.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund empfängt das Particl-Team keine Gehälter mehr, bis eine neue Lösung gefunden wird, finanzielle Mittel für die Entwicklung am Particl Marketplace zu erhalten. Momentan werden alle Arbeiten ohne Bezahlung und freiwillig erbracht. Dies führt leider zu einer erheblichen Reduzierung der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit der meisten Teammitglieder, da andere temporäre Verpflichtungen eingegangen werden müssen, um über die Runden zu kommen.</p><p>Dennoch stehen wir kurz vor der Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 und damit der wichtigsten Erweiterung für den Particl Marketplace seit seiner Entstehung. Ein Problem stellt momentan ein Mangel an finanziellen Mitteln dar, um die wegweisende Veröffentlichung auch angemessene zu vermarkten. Die Korrelation aus mangelnden Mitteln für die Entwicklung als auch die Vermarktung haben uns motiviert, an einer Lösung zu arbeiten, die das Projekt langfristig und nachhaltig finanziert und eine verlässliche Mittelbereitstellung garantiert.</p><p>Das neue Modell für die Finanzmittelbeschaffung erfindet das Rad nicht neu. Allerdings würde es dem Particl-Team helfen, dauerhaft an der Weiterentwicklung von Particl zu arbeiten, und dabei nur marginal in die bestehenden Strukturen eingreifen, diese aber deutlich optimieren. Das Particl-Team richtet sich bei dem Entwurf der Finanzmittelbeschaffung nach erfolgreichen Projekten wie bspw. Decred und Siacoin, die vergleichbaren Modelle ausgewählt und damit erfolgreich wirtschaften konnten.</p><h3 id=\"was-k-nnen-wir-erwarten\">Was können wir erwarten?</h3><p>Während die Zahlen rund um die neue Finanzverwaltung noch simuliert und ausgewertet werden, könnte diese die sofortige Vollfinanzierung des Particl-Teams zu den aktuellen Preisen ermöglichen und genügend Mittel für verschiedene Budgets bereitstellen, die auf die Unterstützung und Förderung des Projekts sowie die Erhöhung des Nutzerwachstums ausgerichtet sind.</p><p>Da die neue Finanzmittelbeschaffung wesentlich vom Staking und dem Preis von PART abhängt, kann eine etwaige Erhöhung des PART-Preises ebenfalls dazu beitragen, dass zusätzliche Mittel zur Verfügung stehen, um das Team zu erweitern und Kampagnen zu initiieren, die die Bekanntheit und Nutzerbasis des Particl Marketplace vergrößern und ggf. auch Listings bei anderen Kryptobörsen  ermöglichen. </p><p>Es sollte jedoch eingeschränkt werden, dass eine Erweiterung des Teams erst möglich sein wird, wenn wir wieder eine stabile Struktur innerhalb des Particl-Teams etabliert haben. Eine Erweiterung ist grundsätzlich ein zeitaufwendiger Prozess, der erst in Betracht gezogen wird, wenn es die Zeit erlaubt.</p><p>Als eine Folge der neuen Finanzmittelbeschaffung könnte das Particl Projekt bald wieder in alter Stärke auftrumpfen, womöglich sogar etwas stärker als gewohnt. Wir erwarten, dass sowohl die Entwicklung selbst als auch die öffentliche Kommunikation deutlich verbessert werden können und dabei weder Transparenz, Marketing, eine Steigerung der Nutzerbasis, Werbemaßnahmen und viele andere Initiativen auf der Strecke bleiben. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, Particl nicht nur kurzfristig, sondern vor allem für die Zukunft aufzustellen.</p><h3 id=\"die-finanzmittelbeschaffung-als-ccs-proposal\">Die Finanzmittelbeschaffung als CCS Proposal</h3><p>Das Particl-Team arbeitet zurzeit daran, eine bessere Benutzerschnittstelle (UI) für das sogenannte on-Chain Abstimmungsverfahren fertigzustellen. Dieses soll in den kommenden 1-2 Wochen fertig sein. Es wird uns erlauben, die Vorschläge ansprechend zu visualisieren und das Abstimmungsverfahren einzubauen.</p><p>Da das neue Finanzmittelbeschaffungsmodell die Staking-Rewards sowie den Anteil, der für die Entwicklung und weitere Werbemaßnahmen reserviert ist, anhebt, liegt die oberste Priorität darin, dass die Particl-Community hierzu abstimmt und auf der Protokoll-Ebene zu einer Einigung in der Sache kommt.</p><p>Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt besteht darin, Prozesse deutlich transparenter zu gestalten. Das bedeutet, dass die Finanzmittelverwaltung ebenfalls via on-Chain Abstimmung bestätigt wird. <strong>Jedes Quartal wird deshalb seitens des Particl-Teams ein CCS Vorschlag unterbreitet, der daraufhin von der Particl-Community auf der Protokoll-Ebene bestätigt oder abgelehnt wird</strong>. Salopp formuliert soll dieser Prozess sicherstellen, dass die Particl-Community das letzte Wort darüber hat, in welche Richtung es geht. Dabei sollen Transparenz, Dezentralisierung und Governance (Kontroll- und Steuerungsstruktur) die Eckpfeiler darstellen, um das Particl-Team rechenschaftspflichtig gegenüber der Community zu machen und stets im besten Interesse des gesamten Ökosystem zu handeln.</p><p>Weitere Informationen zu diesem wegweisenden Schritt in die Zukunft von Particl werden in einem weiteren Blogpost zeitnah veröffentlicht. Hier werden dann auch die genauen Details, Zahlen und alle weiteren wichtigen Informationen und Gedanken zum Proposal (Vorschlag) der neuen Finanzverwaltung kommuniziert. </p><h1 id=\"atomic-swaps-im-particl-desktop\">Atomic Swaps im Particl Desktop</h1><p>Doch das ist noch nicht alles.

BasicSwap funktioniert einwandfrei und wurde in einer geschlossenen Beta-Testphase bereits seit Wochen ausprobiert. Das <strong>DEX-Prokoll unterstützt momentan<strong> Particl, Monero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin</strong></strong>, und macht den Handel mit Kryptowährungen widerstandsfähiger und vor allem für jeden zugänglich.</p><p>BasicSwap nutzt Particls SMSG P2P-Netzwerk und ein eigenes Atomic Swap-Protokoll, dass es euch ermöglicht, Kryptowährungen direkt zu tauschen, ohne dass dabei eine weitere Partei benötigt wird oder andere \"Wrapped Coins\" zum Einsatz kommen. Die Swaps werden relativ schnell durchgeführt, sodass ein Tausch zwischen PART und LTC (oder auch PART und XMR) zwischen 20-25 Minuten benötigt.

Es geht uns darum, ein\nallgemeines Grundlagenwissen zu vermitteln, das einige sehr technische Features\nder Plattform, in leicht verständlicher Sprache zugänglich macht und damit als\nReferenzpunkt dienen kann, wenn man neuen Community-Mitgliedern oder Nutzern des\nParticl Marketplace, eine Einführung gibt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl ist eine auf die Privatsphäre seiner Nutzer ausgerichtete Kryptowährung,\ndie unterschiedliche Grade der Anonymisierung anbietet. Da Particl zwei\nverschiedene Anonymisierungstechniken (CT, RingCT) implementiert hat, kann PART\nmittels drei Überweisungsarten über das Netzwerk an eigene und fremde Adressen\nüberwiesen werden. Jede Überweisungsart korrespondiert mit einem spezifischen\nStatus von PART, der im Client zwischen \"public\", \"blind\" und \"anon\"\nunterschieden wird.\n\nJeder Status bringt ein ganz eigenes Level an Privatsphäre und weitere\nCharakteristiken mit sich, die wir euch in diesem Artikel präsentieren wollen. \n\nDieser Artikel soll daher die unterschiedlichen Optionen, die Nutzer beim\nÜberweisen von PART haben, detailliert vorstellen. Dabei soll vor allem erklärt\nwerden, welche Überweisungsarten situationsbedingt zum Einsatz kommen. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInhaltsübersicht \n * Public Transactions — Öffentliche Überweisungen \n * Blinded Transactions (CT) — Vertrauliche Überweisungen\n * Range Proofs\n * Bullet Proofs\n * Anonymous Transactions (RingCT) — Anonyme Überweisungen \n * Ring-Signaturen (MLSAG)\n * Wie macht man eine RingCT-Überweisung im Particl Desktop?\n * Wie bewahre ich eine gute Privatsphäre?\n * Stealth Addresses – Verdeckte Adressen\n * CT + RingCT — Ein perfektes Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublic Transactions — Öffentliche Überweisungen \n * Privatssphäre: Niedrig\n * Transaktionsgebühren: Niedrig (~0.000346 PART)\n * Segwit: Ja (Reduziert die Datenmenge einer Überweisung um bis zu ~20%)\n * Trusted Setup: Nein\n * Programmierbare Outputs: Ja\n\n(Gebühr: 0.000346 PART)Überweisungen werden auf der Blockchain standardmäßig\nöffentlich (public) übertragen, wenn man sich nicht für eine spezielle\nVerschlüsselung entscheidet, um diese zu verbergen. Da Particl auf der Codebasis\nvon Bitcoin basiert, werden alle Überweisungen mit dem Status \"Public\" auf der\nBlockchain öffentlich gespeichert.\n\nEntgegen der landläufigen Meinung, ist die Nutzung von Bitcoin nicht anonym. \nTransaktionen von Bitcoin (und auch Particl) sind nicht anonym, sondern\npseudonym und damit öffentlich einsehbar. Überweisungen können jedoch nicht\ndirekt einer Person zugeordnet werden, sondern sind mittels eines\nalphanumerischen Pseudonyms verbunden.\n\nWährend das zwar genügt, um eine Identität fürs Erste zu verschleiern, können\nbereits einfache Blockchain-Analyse-Protokolle dem neugierigen Auge Hinweise\nliefern, die es ermöglichen, Nutzer und korrespondierende Wallets zu\nidentifizieren. Dieser Vorgang wird noch einfacher, sollten bestimmte\nÜberweisungen an einen externen Serviceanbieter vorgenommen werden, die deine\nWallet mit deinen persönlichen Daten (KYC), die der Serviceanbieter gespeichert\nhat, in Verbindung bringt und damit deinen gesamten Zahlungsverkehr für eine\nDrittpartei offenlegt und mit deinen persönlichen Daten assoziiert. \n\nAus diesem Grund hat sich Particl dazu entschieden, zwei verschiedene\nAnonymisierungstechniken zu implementieren, die Überweisungen auf der Blockchain\nverbergen und Empfänger verschleiern. Beide Protokolle benötigen kein Trusted\nSetup, haben jedoch feste Bezugsgrößen, sodass sie sicher und skalierbar sind.\nSie haben daneben verschiedene Verwendungszwecke innerhalb der Plattform und\nunterscheiden sich hinsichtlich des Anonymisierungsgrades. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlinded Transactions (CT)  —  Vertrauliche Überweisungen \nVertrauliche Überweisungen:\nElements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.\nelementsproject.org\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\n\n * Privatsphäre: Mittel (Überweisungsbeträge werden verborgen)\n * Transaktionsgebühren: Mittel (~0.001962 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduziert die Datenmenge einer CT Überweisung um bis zu ~48%)\n * Bulletproofs: Ja (Reduziert die Datenmenge von Range Proofs um bis zu ~70%)\n * Trusted Setup: Nein\n * Programmierbare Outputs: Ja\n * Whitepaper: \n   https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n\n(Gebühr: 0.001962 PART)Vertrauliche (blind) Überweisungen sind eine\nÜberweisungsart, deren Überweisungsbetrag auf der Blockchain verborgen ist. Die\nBeträge sind ausschließlich den beteiligten Parteien (Sender und Empfänger)\nbekannt und können nicht öffentlich eingesehen werden. Dies wird mittels \nConfidential Transactions (CT)\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation] \numgesetzt. CT ist eine Kryptotechnik, die den in einer Transaktion versendeten\nBetrag verschleiert, es den Nodes des Netzwerkes aber dennoch ermöglicht, zu\nprüfen, dass nicht mehr Coins ausgegeben als überhaupt vorhanden sind. Dabei\nkommt ein sogenannter Zero-Knowledge-Beweis\n[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-Knowledge-Beweis] zum Einsatz, der kein\nTrusted Setup benötigt.\n\nTransaktion einer vertraulichen (blind) Überweisung (CT) auf dem Particl Desktop\nConfidential Transactions benötigen also kein Trusted Setup\n[https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/], was bedeutet, dass Überweisungen\nnicht von einer weiteren (dritten) Partei verifiziert werden müssen. In diesem\nSinn spricht man davon, dass das Protokoll \"trustless\" ist. Das Problem bei\nAnonymisierungstechniken, die ein sogenanntes Trusted Setup benötigen, ist, dass\nbei der ersten Konfiguration ein sogenannter Master Key (Seed) erzeugt wird.\nNutzer müssen in der Folge darauf vertrauen, dass der bei der Konfiguration des\nProtokolls erzeugte Master Key, anschließend unwiederbringlich zerstört wird.\nDer Master Key könnte sonst dafür verwendet werden, eine unbegrenzte Menge an\nCoins zu erzeugen, ohne dass das jemand merken würde.\n\nConfidential Transactions brauchen folglich eine Form von Beweis (proof), dass\neine Transaktion nicht die Geldmenge manipuliert, indem sie etwa negative\nBeträge versendet. Logisch: Wenn man den Betrag einer Transaktion nicht kennt,\nist es schwierig, dies zu wissen. \n\nRange Proofs\nUm dieses Problem zu lösen, nutzt Particl sogenannte „Range Proofs“. Mithilfe\nder Range Proofs kann man prüfen, ob der Inhalt einer Transaktion in einem\nbestimmten mathematischen Bereich (range) liegt, der größer gleich Null ist,\nohne den genauen Wert dabei zu bestimmen. Ohne den Einsatz von Range Proofs\nkönnten die Überweisungsbeträge derart manipuliert werden, dass man negative\nZahlen erhält und somit die Möglichkeit, Coins artifiziell zu generieren. Ein\nAngriffsvektor ließe folglich über einen hohen negativen Output und einen\nweiteren Output herstellen, sodass sich beide Summe ausgleichen und Null ergeben\n\nRange Proofs haben jedoch den Nachteil, dass sie recht groß sind und linear mit\nder Anzahl an Outputs und Bits des Bereichs skalieren. Range Proofs sind deshalb\nfür einen Großteil der Datenmenge einer vertraulichen (blind) Überweisung\nverantwortlich.\n\nDieser Nachteil bedeutet, dass bei einer gesteigerten Nutzung des Protokolls,\ndeutlich höhere Datenmengen als bei öffentlichen (public) Überweisungen anfallen\nund das zur Folge hat, dass sowohl Transaktionsgebühren und die Blockchain an\nsich, exponentiell im Verhältnis zur Nutzung von CT wachsen. \n\nDie damit einhergehenden Probleme hinsichtlich der Skalierbarkeit waren ein\nausschlaggebender Grund, warum die RingCT-Implementierung von Particl nicht\nbereits früher auf dem Mainnet veröffentlicht wurde. \n\nDie Lösung für dieses Problem stellen die sogenannten „Bullet Proofs\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066]“ dar.\n\nBullet Proofs\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n * Abschlussbericht über die Prüfung der Implementierung von Bullet Proofs durch \n   Quarkslab: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nDie Bullet Proofs stellen eine neue Generation an Range Proofs dar, die nicht\nlinear, sondern logarithmisch skalieren. Im Whitepaper\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] wird der Bullet Proof-Algorithmus als \"\nnon-interactive zero-knowledge short proof\" beschrieben, der es ermöglicht, die\nGröße einer einfachen Transaktion um bis zu 70 Prozent zu senken. Da Range\nProofs, wie bereits oben erwähnt, für einen Großteil der Datenmenge einer\nvertraulichen (blind) Überweisung verantwortlich sind, können mittels der Bullet\nProofs sowohl die Transaktionskosten signifikant gesenkt als auch verhindert\nwerden, dass diese zu viel Platz auf Blockchain einnehmen und diese unnötig groß\nwerden lässt.\n\n> Schon gewusst? Der Begriff “Bullet Proofs” wurde von Shashank Agrawal geprägt,\nals er den neuartigen Range Proof  treffend mit \"short like a bullet, with\nbulletproof security assumption\" beschrieb. \nAnonymous Transactions (RingCT)  —  Anonyme Überweisungen \n * Privatsphäre: Hoch (Überweisungsbeträge sowie deren Sender und Empfänger\n   bleiben verborgen)\n * Transaktionsgebühren: Mittel bis hoch. Die Gebühren variieren hinsichtlich\n   der Anzahl der Ring-Teilnehmer.\n * Transaktionsgebühren für eine befriedigende Privatsphäre : ~0.003232 PART\n * Transaktionsgebühren für eine ausgezeichnete Privatsphäre: ~0.009032 PART\n * Segwit: Ja (Reduziert die Datenmenge einer Überweisung um bis zu ~47%)\n * Bullet Proofs: Ja (Reduziert die Datenmenge von Range Proofs um bis zu ~70%)\n * Trusted Setup: Nein\n * Programmierbare Outputs: Nein\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n\n(Gebühr: 0.005708 PART für 8 Ring-Teilnehmer und 2 Outputs)Anonyme (anon)\nÜberweisungen bringen die Privatsphäre auf ein neues Level, da nicht nur die\nÜberweisungsbeträge verschleiert, sondern auch Sender und Empfänger der\nZahlungen komplett verborgen werden.\n\nRing-Signaturen wurden erstmals im Jahr 2001 vorgestellt. Sie sind eine\nkryptographische Technologie, um Nachrichten in einer Weise zu signieren, dass\nsich zwar verifizieren lässt, dass sie von einem Mitglied einer Gruppe stammen,\naber nicht feststellen kann, von wem genau. Ring-Signaturen (RingCT) wurden\nzuerst von der Kryptowährung Monero eingeführt.\n\n> Hintergrund: Monero basiert im Gegensatz zu Particl und anderen Kryptowährungen\nwie Litecoin nicht auf der Codebasis von Bitcoin, sondern auf dem\nCryptoNote-Protokoll. Während RingCT von Monero zuerst auf CryptoNote eingeführt\nwurde, hat Particl als erstes Team überhaupt, eine eigene Implementierung für\neine andere Codebasis als CryptoNote brauchbar gemacht, nämlich für Bitcoins\nCodebasis.\nFür Particl stellt die Implementierung von RingCT auf der Codebasis von Bitcoin\nein Vorteil dar, da die avancierte Anonymisierungstechnologie (RingCT) damit in\nden Genuss der weltweit sichersten und stabilsten Codebasis (Bitcoin), und deren\nregelmäßige Updates kommt. \n\nAnonyme (anon) Überweisung, die mittels RingCT (mit 22 Ring-Teilnehmern) auf dem\nParticl Desktop gesendet wird.Beispielhaft für die Synergieeffekte zwischen\nRingCT und der Codebasis von Bitcoin, kann die vereinfachte Anwendbarkeit\nstehen, die mittels spezieller Skripte, Atomic Swaps, dezentraler Anwendungen\n(wie bspw. Particls  Marketplace), Lightning Network u.v.m., ermöglicht wird.\nDaneben kann RingCT nun auch direkt mit CT Outputs verbunden werden und erreicht\ndamit eine vollständige Programmierbarkeit. Doch dazu später mehr.\n\nVergleichbar mit vertraulichen (blind) Überweisungen, die das CT-Protokoll\nnutzen, sind anonyme (anon) Überweisungen komplett trustless. Darüber hinaus ist\nhervorzuheben, dass RingCT-Überweisungen noch etwas größer hinsichtlich der\nDatenmenge sind als Confidential Transactions. Dies wird hauptsächlich von den\nRing-Signaturen (MLSAG) beeinflusst.\n\nRing-Signaturen (MLSAG)\n * Abschlussbericht über die Prüfung der Implementierung von MLSAG durch \n   Quarkslab: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nDas Präfix Ring bezieht sich auf den Begriff \"Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous\nAd-Hoc Group Signatures\" (MLSAG), oder schlicht Ring-Signaturen. Es handelt sich\num einen speziellen Typ einer digitalen Unterschrift, die von verschiedenen\nOutputs gleichzeitig durch eine festgelegte Gruppe von RingCT Outputs - d.h.\nallen verfügbaren Coins (anon) - verifiziert wird. Für einen Beobachter ist es\ndeshalb unmöglich festzustellen, welcher Output der Ring-Signaturen tatsächlich\neine Überweisung getätigt hat. Die beteiligten Akteure (Sender und Empfänger)\nbleiben genauso verborgen, wie auch alle anderen Details der Transaktion.\n\nWikipedia beschreibt Ring-Signaturen wie folgt: \"Eine Ring-Signatur ist eine Art\ndigitale Signatur, die von jedem Mitglied einer Gruppe von Nutzern ausgeführt\nwerden kann, die jeweils über Schlüssel (key) verfügen. Daher wird eine mit\neiner Ring-Signatur signierte Nachricht von einer bestimmten Personengruppe\nverifiziert. Eine der Sicherheitseigenschaften einer Ring-Signatur besteht\ndarin, dass es rechnerisch unmöglich sein sollte, zu bestimmen, welcher der\nMitgliederschlüssel des Satzes zur Erstellung der Signatur verwendet wurde.\nRingsignaturen ähneln Gruppensignaturen, unterscheiden sich jedoch in zwei\nwesentlichen Punkten: Erstens kann die Anonymität einer einzelnen Signatur nicht\nwiderrufen werden, und zweitens kann jede Gruppe von Benutzern ohne zusätzliche\nEinrichtung als Signatursatz verwendet werden.\"\n\nIm Falle von RingCT ist festzustellen, dass die digitale Unterschrift, mit der\neine Überweisung signiert wird, von jedem Ring-Teilnehmer gezeichnet werden\nkann. Als Ring-Teilnehmer wird man aktiv, wenn man eine unbestimmte Menge an\nanonymen (anon) Geldmitteln in seiner Wallet aufbewahrt. Diese Geldmittel werden\ndafür verwendet, RingCT Überweisungen des Netzwerkes auszuführen.\n\nBevor eine Überweisung ausgeführt wird, nutzt das Protokoll anonym andere\nRingCT-Outputs als sogenannte Köder (decyos) und benutzt diese um die\nÜberweisung zu signieren. Wenn die Überweisung schliesslich verifiziert wurde,\nsieht es danach aus, als wäre die Überweisung von den RingCT-Outputs eines\nbeliebigen Ring-Teilnehmers ausgelöst worden. Dadurch ist es nicht möglich\nherauszufinden, wer die Überweisung wirklich getätigt hat, da theoretisch jeder\nals Köder (decoy) verwendete Output eines Ring-Teilnehmers infrage kommt.\n\nDurch diesen Vorgang werden faktisch alle Werte und Informationen einer\nÜberweisung mittels des RingCT-Protokolls verborgen; sowohl der\nÜberweisungsbetrag als auch die Adressen des Senders und Empfängers. So\nermöglicht die Anonymisierung ein glaubwürdiges Abstreiten der Kenntnis eines\nSachverhalts (plausible deniability) (1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability], 2\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption]).\n\nWie macht man eine RingCT-Überweisung im Particl Desktop?\nEine RingCT-Überweisung mit 24 Ring-TeilnehmernDer Particl Desktop bietet die\nMöglichkeit an, die Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern bei jeder Überweisung\nauszuwählen, und damit den Grad der Anonymisierung (Privacy Level) jeweils\nselbst festzulegen. Im Desktop Client wird diese Option als \"NO. OF RING SIGS\" \ngekennzeichnet.\n\nDas bedeutet, dass für jeden Input (Überweisungsbetrag), den du nutzt, um eine\nÜberweisung auszuführen, eine bestimmte Anzahl an anderen Outputs (decoys)\nverwendet werden, um die Überweisung zu signieren und damit zu verifizieren.\nJeder der im Bild ausgewählten 24 Outputs der Ring-Teilnehmer hätte die\nÜberweisung letztlich signieren können.\n\nIm Bild oben beträgt der ausgewählte Wert 24. Das bedeutet, dass 23 Outputs als\nKöder fungieren, um eine reale Überweisung zu verschleiern (vorausgesetzt es\ngibt nur einen Input). Sollte die Überweisung drei Inputs nutzen, bedeutet dies\nauch, dass drei verschiedene Überweisungen mit jeweils 24 Ring-Teilnehmern\nsigniert werden, um die Überweisung auszuführen. \n\nFalls das alles sehr kompliziert klingt, möchte wir dich beruhigen, der Particl\nDesktop erledigt das alles für dich im Hintergrund, sodass eine Überweisung\nmittels RingCT so einfach funktioniert, wie jede andere Überweisung, die du\nkennst.\n\nUm eine RingCT-Überweisung auszuführen, genügt es \"Send/Convert\" und\nanschliessend die Überweisungsart \"Anon\" auszuwählen. Nun können noch erweiterte\nOptionen angewählt werden, um den Grad der Anonymisierung (Privacy Level)\nmittels \"NO. OF RING SIGS\" festzulegen. Die Auswahl erfolgt am linken unteren\nBildschirmrand. Der ausgewählte Wert wird der Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern\nentsprechen, die deine Überweisung signieren und darüber hinaus verschleiern.\nPraktisch kann man diese Auswahl auch ignorieren und standardmäßig mit 8\nRing-Teilnehmern signieren, da so eine gute Balance zwischen dem Grad der\nAnonymisierung und den dafür anfallenden Kosten besteht.\n\n> Hinweis: Je mehr Inputs verwendet werden um eine Überweisung zu signieren, umso\nmehr Gebühren fallen an und der Grad der Anonymisierung steigt. Daraus folgt, je\nmehr Ring-Teilnehmer (\"RING SIGS\") vor einer Überweisung ausgewählt werden, umso\nhöher sind die Gebühren und der Grad der Anonymisierung. Sollten steigende\nGebühren kein Problem für dich darstellen und der Datenschutz im Vordergrund\nstehen, sollte jede Überweisung mit der größtmöglichen Anzahl an\nRing-Teilnehmern und Inputs ausgelöst werden.\nWie bewahre ich eine gute Privatsphäre?\nAls Faustregel gilt, dass RingCT einen besseren Grad der Anonymisierung\nanbietet, wenn mehr öffentliche (public) in anonyme (anon) Geldmittel\nkonvertiert werden und in der Folge auch für Transaktionen genutzt werden.\nDadurch entsteht eine größere Anzahl an anonymen (anon) Outputs, die als\nRing-Teilnehmer RingCT-Überweisungen verschleiern können. Die Funktionsweise von\nRingCT stützt sich also grundsätzlich auf den Output, der in anonymen\nGeldmitteln liegt, um eine Verschleierung der tatsächlich verwendeten Geldmittel\nzu ermöglichen. Je mehr RingCT Outputs vorhanden sind, desto stärker ist die\nPrivatsphäre, die von RingCT ermöglicht wird.\n\nWährend die Outputs für RingCT in der Regel zufällig von allen verfügbaren\nanonymen (anon) Outputs ausgewählt werden, lässt sich dennoch eine Tendenz\nfeststellen, dass diese vor allem aus neueren RingCT-Überweisungen ausgewählt\nwerden. Der Grund dafür, dass sich das Protokoll so verhält, kann ausgehend von\ndiesem akademischen Paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/] abgeleitet werden.\nDie Autoren weisen nach, dass sich tatsächliche Inputs - die eigentlich\nverschleiert werden sollen - tendenziell erraten lassen, sollten die verwendeten\nKöder (decoy) älter sein und schon eine Weile keine Überweisungen mehr signiert\nhaben.\n\nAus diesem Grund scheint es ratsam zu sein, dass alle Nutzer einen gewissen Teil\nihrer verfügbaren Geldmittel in anonymisierten Coins halten, um damit jederzeit\nautomatisch Überweisungen des Netzwerkes signieren zu können. Zusätzlich wird\nempfohlen, dass Nutzer Überweisungen so oft es möglich ist mittels\nanonymisierter (anon) Geldmittel vornehmen, um damit eine größtmögliche\nPrivatsphäre des Netzwerkes sicherzustellen.\n\n> Hinweis: Diese Empfehlungen sind nicht zwingend notwendig, um eine\nRingCT-Überweisung durchzuführen. Je mehr Nutzer diese jedoch machen, desto\nstärker und widerstandsfähiger wird das RingCT-Protokoll.\nDas ist auch der Hauptgrund, warum alle Überweisungen auf dem Particl\nMarketplace standardmäßig als RingCT-Überweisungen abgewickelt werden. Der beste\nWeg um den RingCT-Pool zu erhöhen, liegt in einer Steigerung der\nTransaktionsaktivität des Marktplatzes und damit einhergehend der Nutzung des\nProtokolls, das durch den Marktplatz selbst langfristig zu einer extrem soliden\nBasis verholfen wird.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStealth Addresses – Verdeckte Adressen\nParticl ermöglicht es darüber hinaus, dass alle Nutzer verdeckte (stealth)\nAdressen, anstelle von öffentlichen (public) Adressen verwenden. Diese Adressen\nsind sogenannte \"one-time\" Adressen, was nicht bedeutet, dass sie nur einmal\nverwendet werden können, sondern beim Empfang von mehreren Zahlungen jedes Mal\ngesondert eine neue, einzigartige 'one-time' Adresse für den Output der\nÜberweisung generieren.\n\nOhne die Kenntnis des privaten Schlüssels (private key) einer Adresse, ist es\nfür einen außenstehenden Beobachter unmöglich, die Outputs einer verdeckten\n(stealth) Adresse zuzuordnen und hilft so dabei, die Identität eines\nZahlungsempfängers zu schützen.\n\nVerdeckte (stealth) Adressen sind als solche noch kein vollständiger Schutz um\nalle Details einer Überweisung zu verschleiern, insbesondere dann nicht, wenn\njemand genügend Ressourcen und Motivation aufbringt. Verdeckte Adressen\nentfalten vor allem im Zusammenspiel mit stärkeren Anonymisierungstechniken wie\nCT und RingCT ihre ganzes Potential. Sowohl vertrauliche (blind) als auch\nanonyme (anon) Überweisungen können nur an verdeckte (stealth) Adressen gesendet\nwerden.\n\nCT + RingCT — Ein perfektes Team\nBeide Anonymisierungstechniken haben ihre eigenen Vor- und Nachteile. Ein\nwesentlicher Unterschied von CT und RingCT besteht darin, dass CT\nprogrammierbare Outputs hat, RingCT nicht. Dies hat zur Folge, dass RingCT\nselbst nicht in komplexeren Skripten eingesetzt werden kann; jedoch in\ndezentralisierten Anwendungen (dApps), wie dem Open Marketplace von Particl. Das\nist einer der wesentlichen Gründe, warum beide Protokolle weiterhin Anwendung im\nNetzwerk finden, und nicht nur eins der beiden.\n\nDa CT-Überweisungen einen programmierbaren Output haben, können sie in\nSmart-Contracts eingesetzt und mit RingCT-Überweisungen verbunden werden. Im\nFalle von Particls Implementierung können daher Outputs von RingCT zu CT\nkonvertiert, und somit für andere Skripte (bspw. in Smart-Contracts) genutzt\nwerden, und im Anschluss wieder zu RingCT rücküberwiesen werden. \n\nBeispielhaft für die Synergieffekte beider Protokolle kann die Funktionsweise\ndes  Marktplatzes von Particl gelten. Der Particl Marketplace ist\n\"private-by-default\". Das bedeutet, dass datenschutzfreundliche Voreinstellungen\nstandardmäßig alle Teilbereiche der Anwendung durchdringen und die Privatsphäre\nseiner Nutzer schützt. RingCT wird für alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz\ngenutzt, um diese zu verbergen und so eine komplett anonyme Nutzung zu\nermöglichen. \n\nWusstest du, dass der Marktplatz beide Protokolle kombiniert - RingCT für die\nÜberweisung und CT für den Smart-Contract - um Particls dezentrales\nZweiparteien-Treuhandsystem (Escrow) zu ermöglichen?\n\nDas hat den einfachen Grund, dass die Funktionalität des Treuhandsystems auf\neinem Smart-Contract basiert und folglich programmierbare Outputs benötigt. Da\nalle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz mittels RingCT ablaufen, müssen Nutzer\neine RingCT-Überweisung in den Smart-Contract schicken, die dort automatisch von\nRingCT zu CT konvertiert wird. Sobald beide Parteien - Verkäufer und Käufer -\nden hinterlegten Treuhandbetrag freigeben, wird dieser wieder von CT zu RingCT\nkonvertiert und zurückerstattet.\n\n> \"Ein RingCT-Output wird in einen CT-Output konvertiert, der wiederum Grundlage\ndes Inputs für den Treuhandvertrag darstellt. Wenn der Kauf abgeschlossen und\nder Treuhandvertrag erfüllt ist, wird es umgehend konvertiert und wieder als\nRingCT-Output erstattet.\" — Kewde [https://github.com/kewde/], Particl\nEntwickler und OMP Library [https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/] Author\nDies ist nur ein Beispiel, wie RingCT sein vollständiges Potential mittels des\nCT-Protokolls abruft und damit einen tiefgreifenden Einfluss auf das\nParticl-Netzwerk hat sowie vielseitige Anwendungsbereiche für die Codebasis von\nBitcoin aufzeigen kann.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWillst du mehr über Particl, die Plattform und den Particl Marketplace erfahren? \n\nBehalte Particl.news [http://particl.news/] im Auge und bleib auf dem neuesten\nStand.

Da Particl auf der Codebasis von Bitcoin basiert, werden alle Überweisungen mit dem Status \"Public\" auf der Blockchain öffentlich gespeichert.</p><p><strong>Entgegen der landläufigen Meinung, ist die Nutzung von Bitcoin nicht anonym.</strong> Transaktionen von Bitcoin (und auch Particl) sind nicht anonym, sondern pseudonym und damit öffentlich einsehbar. Überweisungen können jedoch nicht direkt einer Person zugeordnet werden, sondern sind mittels eines alphanumerischen Pseudonyms verbunden.</p><p>Während das zwar genügt, um eine Identität fürs Erste zu verschleiern, können bereits einfache Blockchain-Analyse-Protokolle dem neugierigen Auge Hinweise liefern, die es ermöglichen, Nutzer und korrespondierende Wallets zu identifizieren. Dieser Vorgang wird noch einfacher, sollten bestimmte Überweisungen an einen externen Serviceanbieter vorgenommen werden, die deine Wallet mit deinen persönlichen Daten (KYC), die der Serviceanbieter gespeichert hat, in Verbindung bringt und damit deinen gesamten Zahlungsverkehr für eine Drittpartei offenlegt und mit deinen persönlichen Daten assoziiert. </p><p>Aus diesem Grund hat sich Particl dazu entschieden, zwei verschiedene Anonymisierungstechniken zu implementieren, die Überweisungen auf der Blockchain verbergen und Empfänger verschleiern. Beide Protokolle benötigen kein Trusted Setup, haben jedoch feste Bezugsgrößen, sodass sie sicher und skalierbar sind. Sie haben daneben verschiedene Verwendungszwecke innerhalb der Plattform und unterscheiden sich hinsichtlich des Anonymisierungsgrades. </p><hr><h2 id=\"blinded-transactions-ct-vertrauliche-berweisungen\">Blinded Transactions (CT)  —  Vertrauliche Überweisungen </h2><p><strong>Vertrauliche Überweisungen:</strong><br><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><em><em>Elements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.</em></em>elementsproject.org</a></p><ul><li><strong>Privatsphäre</strong>: Mittel (Überweisungsbeträge werden verborgen)</li><li><strong>Transaktionsgebühren</strong>: Mittel (~0.001962 PART)</li><li><strong>Segwit</strong>: Yes (Reduziert die Datenmenge einer CT Überweisung um bis zu ~48%)</li><li><strong>Bulletproofs</strong>: Ja (Reduziert die Datenmenge von Range Proofs um bis zu ~70%)</li><li><strong>Trusted Setup</strong>: Nein</li><li><strong>Programmierbare Outputs</strong>: Ja</li><li><strong>Whitepaper</strong>: <a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png 800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>(Gebühr: 0.001962 PART)</figcaption></figure><p>Vertrauliche (blind) Überweisungen sind eine Überweisungsart, deren Überweisungsbetrag auf der Blockchain verborgen ist.

Dies wird mittels <a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><strong><strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong></strong></a> umgesetzt. CT ist eine Kryptotechnik, die den in einer Transaktion versendeten Betrag verschleiert, es den Nodes des Netzwerkes aber dennoch ermöglicht, zu prüfen, dass nicht mehr Coins ausgegeben als überhaupt vorhanden sind. Dabei kommt ein sogenannter <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-Knowledge-Beweis\">Zero-Knowledge-Beweis</a> zum Einsatz, der kein Trusted Setup benötigt.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-q2ZhXl4uqiCXm9IfbIAQuA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Transaktion einer vertraulichen (blind) Überweisung (CT) auf dem Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>Confidential Transactions benötigen also kein <a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\">Trusted Setup</a>, was bedeutet, dass Überweisungen nicht von einer weiteren (dritten) Partei verifiziert werden müssen. In diesem Sinn spricht man davon, dass das Protokoll \"trustless\" ist. Das Problem bei Anonymisierungstechniken, die ein sogenanntes Trusted Setup benötigen, ist, dass bei der ersten Konfiguration ein sogenannter Master Key (Seed) erzeugt wird. Nutzer müssen in der Folge darauf vertrauen, dass der bei der Konfiguration des Protokolls erzeugte Master Key, anschließend unwiederbringlich zerstört wird. Der Master Key könnte sonst dafür verwendet werden, eine unbegrenzte Menge an Coins zu erzeugen, ohne dass das jemand merken würde.</p><p>Confidential Transactions brauchen folglich eine Form von Beweis (proof), dass eine Transaktion nicht die Geldmenge manipuliert, indem sie etwa negative Beträge versendet. Logisch: Wenn man den Betrag einer Transaktion nicht kennt, ist es schwierig, dies zu wissen. </p><h3 id=\"range-proofs\">Range Proofs</h3><p>Um dieses Problem zu lösen, nutzt Particl sogenannte „Range Proofs“. Mithilfe der Range Proofs kann man prüfen, ob der Inhalt einer Transaktion in einem bestimmten mathematischen Bereich (range) liegt, der größer gleich Null ist, ohne den genauen Wert dabei zu bestimmen. Ohne den Einsatz von Range Proofs könnten die Überweisungsbeträge derart manipuliert werden, dass man negative Zahlen erhält und somit die Möglichkeit, Coins artifiziell zu generieren. Ein Angriffsvektor ließe folglich über einen hohen negativen Output und einen weiteren Output herstellen, sodass sich beide Summe ausgleichen und Null ergeben</p><p>Range Proofs haben jedoch den Nachteil, dass sie recht groß sind und linear mit der Anzahl an Outputs und Bits des Bereichs skalieren. Range Proofs sind deshalb für einen Großteil der Datenmenge einer vertraulichen (blind) Überweisung verantwortlich.</p><p>Dieser Nachteil bedeutet, dass bei einer gesteigerten Nutzung des Protokolls, deutlich höhere Datenmengen als bei öffentlichen (public) Überweisungen anfallen und das zur Folge hat, dass sowohl Transaktionsgebühren und die Blockchain an sich, exponentiell im Verhältnis zur Nutzung von CT wachsen. </p><p>Die damit einhergehenden Probleme hinsichtlich der Skalierbarkeit waren ein ausschlaggebender Grund, warum die RingCT-Implementierung von Particl nicht bereits früher auf dem Mainnet veröffentlicht wurde. </p><p>Die Lösung für dieses Problem stellen die sogenannten „<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066\">Bullet Proofs</a>“ dar.</p><h3 id=\"bullet-proofs\">Bullet Proofs</h3><ul><li><em><em>Whitepaper: </em></em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><em>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</em></em></a></li><li><em>Abschlussbericht über die Prüfung der Implementierung von<em> </em>Bullet Proofs durch <em>Quarkslab: </em></em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><em>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</em></em></a></li></ul><p>Die Bullet Proofs stellen eine neue Generation an Range Proofs dar, die nicht linear, sondern logarithmisch skalieren.

Es handelt sich um einen speziellen Typ einer digitalen Unterschrift, die von verschiedenen Outputs gleichzeitig durch eine festgelegte Gruppe von RingCT Outputs - d.h. allen verfügbaren Coins (anon) - verifiziert wird. Für einen Beobachter ist es deshalb unmöglich festzustellen, welcher Output der Ring-Signaturen tatsächlich eine Überweisung getätigt hat. Die beteiligten Akteure (Sender und Empfänger) bleiben genauso verborgen, wie auch alle anderen Details der Transaktion.</p><p>Wikipedia beschreibt Ring-Signaturen wie folgt: \"Eine Ring-Signatur ist eine Art digitale Signatur, die von jedem Mitglied einer Gruppe von Nutzern ausgeführt werden kann, die jeweils über Schlüssel (key) verfügen. Daher wird eine mit einer Ring-Signatur signierte Nachricht von einer bestimmten Personengruppe verifiziert. Eine der Sicherheitseigenschaften einer Ring-Signatur besteht darin, dass es rechnerisch unmöglich sein sollte, zu bestimmen, welcher der Mitgliederschlüssel des Satzes zur Erstellung der Signatur verwendet wurde. Ringsignaturen ähneln Gruppensignaturen, unterscheiden sich jedoch in zwei wesentlichen Punkten: Erstens kann die Anonymität einer einzelnen Signatur nicht widerrufen werden, und zweitens kann jede Gruppe von Benutzern ohne zusätzliche Einrichtung als Signatursatz verwendet werden.\"</p><p>Im Falle von RingCT ist festzustellen, dass die digitale Unterschrift, mit der eine Überweisung signiert wird, von jedem Ring-Teilnehmer gezeichnet werden kann. Als Ring-Teilnehmer wird man aktiv, wenn man eine unbestimmte Menge an anonymen (anon) Geldmitteln in seiner Wallet aufbewahrt. Diese Geldmittel werden dafür verwendet, RingCT Überweisungen des Netzwerkes auszuführen.</p><p>Bevor eine Überweisung ausgeführt wird, nutzt das Protokoll anonym andere RingCT-Outputs als sogenannte Köder (decyos)<strong> </strong>und benutzt diese um die Überweisung zu signieren. Wenn die Überweisung schliesslich verifiziert wurde, sieht es danach aus, als wäre die Überweisung von den RingCT-Outputs eines beliebigen Ring-Teilnehmers ausgelöst worden. Dadurch ist es nicht möglich herauszufinden, wer die Überweisung wirklich getätigt hat, da theoretisch jeder als Köder (decoy) verwendete Output eines Ring-Teilnehmers infrage kommt.</p><p>Durch diesen Vorgang werden faktisch alle Werte und Informationen einer Überweisung mittels des RingCT-Protokolls verborgen;<strong> </strong>sowohl der Überweisungsbetrag als auch die Adressen des Senders und Empfängers. So ermöglicht die Anonymisierung ein glaubwürdiges Abstreiten der Kenntnis eines Sachverhalts (plausible deniability) (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\">2</a>).</p><h3 id=\"wie-macht-man-eine-ringct-berweisung-im-particl-desktop\">Wie macht man eine RingCT-Überweisung im Particl Desktop?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png 600w\"><figcaption>Eine RingCT-Überweisung mit 24 Ring-Teilnehmern</figcaption></figure><p>Der Particl Desktop bietet die Möglichkeit an, die Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern bei jeder Überweisung auszuwählen, und damit den Grad der Anonymisierung (Privacy Level) jeweils selbst festzulegen. Im Desktop Client wird diese Option als \"<em><em>NO.

Jeder der im Bild ausgewählten 24 Outputs der Ring-Teilnehmer hätte die Überweisung letztlich signieren können.</p><p>Im Bild oben beträgt der ausgewählte Wert 24. Das bedeutet, dass 23 Outputs als Köder fungieren, um eine reale Überweisung zu verschleiern (vorausgesetzt es gibt nur einen Input). Sollte die Überweisung drei Inputs nutzen, bedeutet dies auch, dass drei verschiedene Überweisungen mit jeweils 24 Ring-Teilnehmern signiert werden, um die Überweisung auszuführen. </p><p>Falls das alles sehr kompliziert klingt, möchte wir dich beruhigen, der Particl Desktop erledigt das alles für dich im Hintergrund, sodass eine Überweisung mittels RingCT so einfach funktioniert, wie jede andere Überweisung, die du kennst.</p><p>Um eine RingCT-Überweisung auszuführen, genügt es \"Send/Convert\" und anschliessend die Überweisungsart \"Anon\" auszuwählen. Nun können noch erweiterte Optionen angewählt werden, um den Grad der Anonymisierung (Privacy Level) mittels \"NO. OF RING SIGS\" festzulegen. Die Auswahl erfolgt am linken unteren Bildschirmrand. Der ausgewählte Wert wird der Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern entsprechen, die deine Überweisung signieren und darüber hinaus verschleiern. Praktisch kann man diese Auswahl auch ignorieren und standardmäßig mit 8 Ring-Teilnehmern signieren, da so eine gute Balance zwischen dem Grad der Anonymisierung und den dafür anfallenden Kosten besteht.</p><blockquote><strong>Hinweis<strong>: </strong></strong>Je mehr Inputs verwendet werden um eine Überweisung zu signieren, umso mehr Gebühren fallen an und der Grad der Anonymisierung steigt. Daraus folgt, je mehr Ring-Teilnehmer (\"RING SIGS\") vor einer Überweisung ausgewählt werden, umso höher sind die Gebühren und der Grad der Anonymisierung. Sollten steigende Gebühren kein Problem für dich darstellen und der Datenschutz im Vordergrund stehen, sollte jede Überweisung mit der größtmöglichen Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern und Inputs ausgelöst werden.</blockquote><h3 id=\"wie-bewahre-ich-eine-gute-privatsph-re\">Wie bewahre ich eine gute Privatsphäre?</h3><p>Als Faustregel gilt, dass RingCT einen besseren Grad der Anonymisierung anbietet, wenn mehr öffentliche (public) in anonyme (anon) Geldmittel konvertiert werden und in der Folge auch für Transaktionen genutzt werden. Dadurch entsteht eine größere Anzahl an anonymen (anon) Outputs, die als Ring-Teilnehmer RingCT-Überweisungen verschleiern können. Die Funktionsweise von RingCT stützt sich also grundsätzlich auf den Output, der in anonymen Geldmitteln liegt, um eine Verschleierung der tatsächlich verwendeten Geldmittel zu ermöglichen. Je mehr RingCT Outputs vorhanden sind, desto stärker ist die Privatsphäre, die von RingCT ermöglicht wird.</p><p>Während die Outputs für RingCT in der Regel zufällig von allen verfügbaren anonymen (anon) Outputs ausgewählt werden, lässt sich dennoch eine Tendenz feststellen, dass diese vor allem aus neueren RingCT-Überweisungen ausgewählt werden. Der Grund dafür, dass sich das Protokoll so verhält, kann ausgehend von diesem <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\">akademischen Paper</a> abgeleitet werden. Die Autoren weisen nach, dass sich tatsächliche Inputs - die eigentlich verschleiert werden sollen - tendenziell erraten lassen, sollten die verwendeten Köder (decoy) älter sein und schon eine Weile keine Überweisungen mehr signiert haben.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund scheint es ratsam zu sein, dass alle Nutzer einen gewissen Teil ihrer verfügbaren Geldmittel in anonymisierten Coins halten, um damit jederzeit automatisch Überweisungen des Netzwerkes signieren zu können. Zusätzlich wird empfohlen, dass Nutzer Überweisungen so oft es möglich ist mittels anonymisierter (anon) Geldmittel vornehmen, um damit eine größtmögliche Privatsphäre des Netzwerkes sicherzustellen.</p><blockquote>Hinweis: Diese Empfehlungen sind nicht zwingend notwendig, um eine RingCT-Überweisung durchzuführen. Je mehr Nutzer diese jedoch machen, desto stärker und widerstandsfähiger wird das RingCT-Protokoll.</blockquote><p>Das ist auch der Hauptgrund, warum alle Überweisungen auf dem Particl Marketplace standardmäßig als RingCT-Überweisungen abgewickelt werden. Der beste Weg um den RingCT-Pool zu erhöhen, liegt in einer Steigerung der Transaktionsaktivität des Marktplatzes und damit einhergehend der Nutzung des Protokolls, das durch den Marktplatz selbst langfristig zu einer extrem soliden Basis verholfen wird.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses-verdeckte-adressen\">Stealth Addresses – Verdeckte Adressen</h2><p>Particl ermöglicht es darüber hinaus, dass alle Nutzer verdeckte (stealth) Adressen, anstelle von öffentlichen (public) Adressen verwenden. Diese Adressen sind sogenannte \"one-time\" Adressen, was nicht bedeutet, dass sie nur einmal verwendet werden können, sondern beim Empfang von mehreren Zahlungen jedes Mal gesondert eine neue, einzigartige 'one-time' Adresse für den Output der Überweisung generieren.  </p><p>Ohne die Kenntnis des privaten Schlüssels (private key) einer Adresse, ist es für einen außenstehenden Beobachter unmöglich, die Outputs einer verdeckten (stealth) Adresse zuzuordnen und hilft so dabei, die Identität eines Zahlungsempfängers zu schützen.</p><p>Verdeckte (stealth) Adressen sind als solche noch kein vollständiger Schutz um alle Details einer Überweisung zu verschleiern, insbesondere dann nicht, wenn jemand genügend Ressourcen und Motivation aufbringt. Verdeckte Adressen entfalten vor allem im Zusammenspiel mit stärkeren Anonymisierungstechniken wie CT und RingCT ihre ganzes Potential. Sowohl vertrauliche (blind) als auch anonyme (anon) Überweisungen können nur an verdeckte (stealth) Adressen gesendet werden.</p><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-ein-perfektes-team\">CT + RingCT — Ein perfektes Team</h2><p>Beide Anonymisierungstechniken haben ihre eigenen Vor- und Nachteile. Ein wesentlicher Unterschied von CT und RingCT besteht darin, dass CT programmierbare Outputs hat, RingCT nicht. Dies hat zur Folge, dass RingCT selbst nicht in komplexeren Skripten eingesetzt werden kann; jedoch in dezentralisierten Anwendungen (dApps), wie dem Open Marketplace von Particl. Das ist einer der wesentlichen Gründe, warum beide Protokolle weiterhin Anwendung im Netzwerk finden, und nicht nur eins der beiden.</p><p>Da CT-Überweisungen einen programmierbaren Output haben, können sie in Smart-Contracts eingesetzt und mit RingCT-Überweisungen verbunden werden. Im Falle von Particls Implementierung können daher Outputs von RingCT zu CT konvertiert, und somit für andere Skripte (bspw. in Smart-Contracts) genutzt werden, und im Anschluss wieder zu RingCT rücküberwiesen werden. </p><p>Beispielhaft für die Synergieffekte beider Protokolle kann die Funktionsweise des  Marktplatzes von Particl gelten. Der Particl Marketplace ist \"private-by-default\". Das bedeutet, dass datenschutzfreundliche Voreinstellungen standardmäßig alle Teilbereiche der Anwendung durchdringen und die Privatsphäre seiner Nutzer schützt. RingCT wird für alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz genutzt, um diese zu verbergen und so eine komplett anonyme Nutzung zu ermöglichen. </p><p>Wusstest du, dass der Marktplatz beide Protokolle kombiniert - RingCT für die Überweisung und CT für den Smart-Contract - um Particls dezentrales Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem (Escrow) zu ermöglichen?</p><p>Das hat den einfachen Grund, dass die Funktionalität des Treuhandsystems auf einem Smart-Contract basiert und folglich programmierbare Outputs benötigt. Da alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz mittels RingCT ablaufen, müssen Nutzer eine RingCT-Überweisung in den Smart-Contract schicken, die dort automatisch von RingCT zu CT konvertiert wird. Sobald beide Parteien - Verkäufer und Käufer - den hinterlegten Treuhandbetrag freigeben, wird dieser wieder von CT zu RingCT konvertiert und zurückerstattet.</p><blockquote>\"Ein RingCT-Output wird in einen CT-Output konvertiert, der wiederum Grundlage des Inputs für den Treuhandvertrag darstellt. Wenn der Kauf abgeschlossen und der Treuhandvertrag erfüllt ist, wird es umgehend konvertiert und wieder als RingCT-Output erstattet.\" — <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\">Kewde</a>, Particl Entwickler und <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\">OMP Library</a> Author</blockquote><p>Dies ist nur ein Beispiel, wie RingCT sein vollständiges Potential mittels des CT-Protokolls abruft und damit einen tiefgreifenden Einfluss auf das Particl-Netzwerk hat sowie vielseitige Anwendungsbereiche für die Codebasis von Bitcoin aufzeigen kann.</p><hr><p>Willst du mehr über Particl, die Plattform und den Particl Marketplace erfahren? <br><br>Behalte <a href=\"http://particl.news/\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Particl.news</strong></strong></strong></strong></a> im Auge und bleib auf dem neuesten Stand.

Da Particl auf der Codebasis von Bitcoin basiert, werden alle Überweisungen mit dem Status \"Public\" auf der Blockchain öffentlich gespeichert.</p><p><strong>Entgegen der landläufigen Meinung, ist die Nutzung von Bitcoin nicht anonym.</strong> Transaktionen von Bitcoin (und auch Particl) sind nicht anonym, sondern pseudonym und damit öffentlich einsehbar. Überweisungen können jedoch nicht direkt einer Person zugeordnet werden, sondern sind mittels eines alphanumerischen Pseudonyms verbunden.</p><p>Während das zwar genügt, um eine Identität fürs Erste zu verschleiern, können bereits einfache Blockchain-Analyse-Protokolle dem neugierigen Auge Hinweise liefern, die es ermöglichen, Nutzer und korrespondierende Wallets zu identifizieren. Dieser Vorgang wird noch einfacher, sollten bestimmte Überweisungen an einen externen Serviceanbieter vorgenommen werden, die deine Wallet mit deinen persönlichen Daten (KYC), die der Serviceanbieter gespeichert hat, in Verbindung bringt und damit deinen gesamten Zahlungsverkehr für eine Drittpartei offenlegt und mit deinen persönlichen Daten assoziiert. </p><p>Aus diesem Grund hat sich Particl dazu entschieden, zwei verschiedene Anonymisierungstechniken zu implementieren, die Überweisungen auf der Blockchain verbergen und Empfänger verschleiern. Beide Protokolle benötigen kein Trusted Setup, haben jedoch feste Bezugsgrößen, sodass sie sicher und skalierbar sind. Sie haben daneben verschiedene Verwendungszwecke innerhalb der Plattform und unterscheiden sich hinsichtlich des Anonymisierungsgrades. </p><hr><h2 id=\"blinded-transactions-ct-vertrauliche-berweisungen\">Blinded Transactions (CT)  —  Vertrauliche Überweisungen </h2><p><strong>Vertrauliche Überweisungen:</strong><br><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><em><em>Elements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.</em></em>elementsproject.org</a></p><ul><li><strong>Privatsphäre</strong>: Mittel (Überweisungsbeträge werden verborgen)</li><li><strong>Transaktionsgebühren</strong>: Mittel (~0.001962 PART)</li><li><strong>Segwit</strong>: Yes (Reduziert die Datenmenge einer CT Überweisung um bis zu ~48%)</li><li><strong>Bulletproofs</strong>: Ja (Reduziert die Datenmenge von Range Proofs um bis zu ~70%)</li><li><strong>Trusted Setup</strong>: Nein</li><li><strong>Programmierbare Outputs</strong>: Ja</li><li><strong>Whitepaper</strong>: <a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/03/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/03/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png 600w, /glink/2021/03/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png 800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>(Gebühr: 0.001962 PART)</figcaption></figure><p>Vertrauliche (blind) Überweisungen sind eine Überweisungsart, deren Überweisungsbetrag auf der Blockchain verborgen ist.

Dies wird mittels <a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><strong><strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong></strong></a> umgesetzt. CT ist eine Kryptotechnik, die den in einer Transaktion versendeten Betrag verschleiert, es den Nodes des Netzwerkes aber dennoch ermöglicht, zu prüfen, dass nicht mehr Coins ausgegeben als überhaupt vorhanden sind. Dabei kommt ein sogenannter <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-Knowledge-Beweis\">Zero-Knowledge-Beweis</a> zum Einsatz, der kein Trusted Setup benötigt.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/03/1-q2ZhXl4uqiCXm9IfbIAQuA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Transaktion einer vertraulichen (blind) Überweisung (CT) auf dem Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>Confidential Transactions benötigen also kein <a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\">Trusted Setup</a>, was bedeutet, dass Überweisungen nicht von einer weiteren (dritten) Partei verifiziert werden müssen. In diesem Sinn spricht man davon, dass das Protokoll \"trustless\" ist. Das Problem bei Anonymisierungstechniken, die ein sogenanntes Trusted Setup benötigen, ist, dass bei der ersten Konfiguration ein sogenannter Master Key (Seed) erzeugt wird. Nutzer müssen in der Folge darauf vertrauen, dass der bei der Konfiguration des Protokolls erzeugte Master Key, anschließend unwiederbringlich zerstört wird. Der Master Key könnte sonst dafür verwendet werden, eine unbegrenzte Menge an Coins zu erzeugen, ohne dass das jemand merken würde.</p><p>Confidential Transactions brauchen folglich eine Form von Beweis (proof), dass eine Transaktion nicht die Geldmenge manipuliert, indem sie etwa negative Beträge versendet. Logisch: Wenn man den Betrag einer Transaktion nicht kennt, ist es schwierig, dies zu wissen. </p><h3 id=\"range-proofs\">Range Proofs</h3><p>Um dieses Problem zu lösen, nutzt Particl sogenannte „Range Proofs“. Mithilfe der Range Proofs kann man prüfen, ob der Inhalt einer Transaktion in einem bestimmten mathematischen Bereich (range) liegt, der größer gleich Null ist, ohne den genauen Wert dabei zu bestimmen. Ohne den Einsatz von Range Proofs könnten die Überweisungsbeträge derart manipuliert werden, dass man negative Zahlen erhält und somit die Möglichkeit, Coins artifiziell zu generieren. Ein Angriffsvektor ließe folglich über einen hohen negativen Output und einen weiteren Output herstellen, sodass sich beide Summe ausgleichen und Null ergeben</p><p>Range Proofs haben jedoch den Nachteil, dass sie recht groß sind und linear mit der Anzahl an Outputs und Bits des Bereichs skalieren. Range Proofs sind deshalb für einen Großteil der Datenmenge einer vertraulichen (blind) Überweisung verantwortlich.</p><p>Dieser Nachteil bedeutet, dass bei einer gesteigerten Nutzung des Protokolls, deutlich höhere Datenmengen als bei öffentlichen (public) Überweisungen anfallen und das zur Folge hat, dass sowohl Transaktionsgebühren und die Blockchain an sich, exponentiell im Verhältnis zur Nutzung von CT wachsen. </p><p>Die damit einhergehenden Probleme hinsichtlich der Skalierbarkeit waren ein ausschlaggebender Grund, warum die RingCT-Implementierung von Particl nicht bereits früher auf dem Mainnet veröffentlicht wurde. </p><p>Die Lösung für dieses Problem stellen die sogenannten „<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066\">Bullet Proofs</a>“ dar.</p><h3 id=\"bullet-proofs\">Bullet Proofs</h3><ul><li><em><em>Whitepaper: </em></em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><em>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</em></em></a></li><li><em>Abschlussbericht über die Prüfung der Implementierung von<em> </em>Bullet Proofs durch <em>Quarkslab: </em></em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><em>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</em></em></a></li></ul><p>Die Bullet Proofs stellen eine neue Generation an Range Proofs dar, die nicht linear, sondern logarithmisch skalieren.

Sie sind eine kryptographische Technologie, um Nachrichten in einer Weise zu signieren, dass sich zwar verifizieren lässt, dass sie von einem Mitglied einer Gruppe stammen, aber nicht feststellen kann, von wem genau. Ring-Signaturen (RingCT) wurden zuerst von der Kryptowährung Monero eingeführt.</p><blockquote>Hintergrund: Monero basiert im Gegensatz zu Particl und anderen Kryptowährungen wie Litecoin nicht auf der Codebasis von Bitcoin, sondern auf dem CryptoNote-Protokoll.

Es handelt sich um einen speziellen Typ einer digitalen Unterschrift, die von verschiedenen Outputs gleichzeitig durch eine festgelegte Gruppe von RingCT Outputs - d.h. allen verfügbaren Coins (anon) - verifiziert wird. Für einen Beobachter ist es deshalb unmöglich festzustellen, welcher Output der Ring-Signaturen tatsächlich eine Überweisung getätigt hat. Die beteiligten Akteure (Sender und Empfänger) bleiben genauso verborgen, wie auch alle anderen Details der Transaktion.</p><p>Wikipedia beschreibt Ring-Signaturen wie folgt: \"Eine Ring-Signatur ist eine Art digitale Signatur, die von jedem Mitglied einer Gruppe von Nutzern ausgeführt werden kann, die jeweils über Schlüssel (key) verfügen. Daher wird eine mit einer Ring-Signatur signierte Nachricht von einer bestimmten Personengruppe verifiziert. Eine der Sicherheitseigenschaften einer Ring-Signatur besteht darin, dass es rechnerisch unmöglich sein sollte, zu bestimmen, welcher der Mitgliederschlüssel des Satzes zur Erstellung der Signatur verwendet wurde. Ringsignaturen ähneln Gruppensignaturen, unterscheiden sich jedoch in zwei wesentlichen Punkten: Erstens kann die Anonymität einer einzelnen Signatur nicht widerrufen werden, und zweitens kann jede Gruppe von Benutzern ohne zusätzliche Einrichtung als Signatursatz verwendet werden.\"</p><p>Im Falle von RingCT ist festzustellen, dass die digitale Unterschrift, mit der eine Überweisung signiert wird, von jedem Ring-Teilnehmer gezeichnet werden kann. Als Ring-Teilnehmer wird man aktiv, wenn man eine unbestimmte Menge an anonymen (anon) Geldmitteln in seiner Wallet aufbewahrt. Diese Geldmittel werden dafür verwendet, RingCT Überweisungen des Netzwerkes auszuführen.</p><p>Bevor eine Überweisung ausgeführt wird, nutzt das Protokoll anonym andere RingCT-Outputs als sogenannte Köder (decyos)<strong> </strong>und benutzt diese um die Überweisung zu signieren. Wenn die Überweisung schliesslich verifiziert wurde, sieht es danach aus, als wäre die Überweisung von den RingCT-Outputs eines beliebigen Ring-Teilnehmers ausgelöst worden. Dadurch ist es nicht möglich herauszufinden, wer die Überweisung wirklich getätigt hat, da theoretisch jeder als Köder (decoy) verwendete Output eines Ring-Teilnehmers infrage kommt.</p><p>Durch diesen Vorgang werden faktisch alle Werte und Informationen einer Überweisung mittels des RingCT-Protokolls verborgen;<strong> </strong>sowohl der Überweisungsbetrag als auch die Adressen des Senders und Empfängers. So ermöglicht die Anonymisierung ein glaubwürdiges Abstreiten der Kenntnis eines Sachverhalts (plausible deniability) (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\">2</a>).</p><h3 id=\"wie-macht-man-eine-ringct-berweisung-im-particl-desktop\">Wie macht man eine RingCT-Überweisung im Particl Desktop?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/03/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/2021/03/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png 600w\"><figcaption>Eine RingCT-Überweisung mit 24 Ring-Teilnehmern</figcaption></figure><p>Der Particl Desktop bietet die Möglichkeit an, die Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern bei jeder Überweisung auszuwählen, und damit den Grad der Anonymisierung (Privacy Level) jeweils selbst festzulegen. Im Desktop Client wird diese Option als \"<em><em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>\"</em> gekennzeichnet.</p><p>Das bedeutet, dass für jeden Input (Überweisungsbetrag), den du nutzt, um eine Überweisung auszuführen, eine bestimmte Anzahl an anderen Outputs (decoys) verwendet werden, um die Überweisung zu signieren und damit zu verifizieren. Jeder der im Bild ausgewählten 24 Outputs der Ring-Teilnehmer hätte die Überweisung letztlich signieren können.</p><p>Im Bild oben beträgt der ausgewählte Wert 24. Das bedeutet, dass 23 Outputs als Köder fungieren, um eine reale Überweisung zu verschleiern (vorausgesetzt es gibt nur einen Input). Sollte die Überweisung drei Inputs nutzen, bedeutet dies auch, dass drei verschiedene Überweisungen mit jeweils 24 Ring-Teilnehmern signiert werden, um die Überweisung auszuführen. </p><p>Falls das alles sehr kompliziert klingt, möchte wir dich beruhigen, der Particl Desktop erledigt das alles für dich im Hintergrund, sodass eine Überweisung mittels RingCT so einfach funktioniert, wie jede andere Überweisung, die du kennst.</p><p>Um eine RingCT-Überweisung auszuführen, genügt es \"Send/Convert\" und anschliessend die Überweisungsart \"Anon\" auszuwählen. Nun können noch erweiterte Optionen angewählt werden, um den Grad der Anonymisierung (Privacy Level) mittels \"NO. OF RING SIGS\" festzulegen. Die Auswahl erfolgt am linken unteren Bildschirmrand. Der ausgewählte Wert wird der Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern entsprechen, die deine Überweisung signieren und darüber hinaus verschleiern. Praktisch kann man diese Auswahl auch ignorieren und standardmäßig mit 8 Ring-Teilnehmern signieren, da so eine gute Balance zwischen dem Grad der Anonymisierung und den dafür anfallenden Kosten besteht.</p><blockquote><strong>Hinweis<strong>: </strong></strong>Je mehr Inputs verwendet werden um eine Überweisung zu signieren, umso mehr Gebühren fallen an und der Grad der Anonymisierung steigt. Daraus folgt, je mehr Ring-Teilnehmer (\"RING SIGS\") vor einer Überweisung ausgewählt werden, umso höher sind die Gebühren und der Grad der Anonymisierung. Sollten steigende Gebühren kein Problem für dich darstellen und der Datenschutz im Vordergrund stehen, sollte jede Überweisung mit der größtmöglichen Anzahl an Ring-Teilnehmern und Inputs ausgelöst werden.</blockquote><h3 id=\"wie-bewahre-ich-eine-gute-privatsph-re\">Wie bewahre ich eine gute Privatsphäre?</h3><p>Als Faustregel gilt, dass RingCT einen besseren Grad der Anonymisierung anbietet, wenn mehr öffentliche (public) in anonyme (anon) Geldmittel konvertiert werden und in der Folge auch für Transaktionen genutzt werden. Dadurch entsteht eine größere Anzahl an anonymen (anon) Outputs, die als Ring-Teilnehmer RingCT-Überweisungen verschleiern können. Die Funktionsweise von RingCT stützt sich also grundsätzlich auf den Output, der in anonymen Geldmitteln liegt, um eine Verschleierung der tatsächlich verwendeten Geldmittel zu ermöglichen. Je mehr RingCT Outputs vorhanden sind, desto stärker ist die Privatsphäre, die von RingCT ermöglicht wird.</p><p>Während die Outputs für RingCT in der Regel zufällig von allen verfügbaren anonymen (anon) Outputs ausgewählt werden, lässt sich dennoch eine Tendenz feststellen, dass diese vor allem aus neueren RingCT-Überweisungen ausgewählt werden. Der Grund dafür, dass sich das Protokoll so verhält, kann ausgehend von diesem <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\">akademischen Paper</a> abgeleitet werden. Die Autoren weisen nach, dass sich tatsächliche Inputs - die eigentlich verschleiert werden sollen - tendenziell erraten lassen, sollten die verwendeten Köder (decoy) älter sein und schon eine Weile keine Überweisungen mehr signiert haben.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund scheint es ratsam zu sein, dass alle Nutzer einen gewissen Teil ihrer verfügbaren Geldmittel in anonymisierten Coins halten, um damit jederzeit automatisch Überweisungen des Netzwerkes signieren zu können. Zusätzlich wird empfohlen, dass Nutzer Überweisungen so oft es möglich ist mittels anonymisierter (anon) Geldmittel vornehmen, um damit eine größtmögliche Privatsphäre des Netzwerkes sicherzustellen.</p><blockquote>Hinweis: Diese Empfehlungen sind nicht zwingend notwendig, um eine RingCT-Überweisung durchzuführen. Je mehr Nutzer diese jedoch machen, desto stärker und widerstandsfähiger wird das RingCT-Protokoll.</blockquote><p>Das ist auch der Hauptgrund, warum alle Überweisungen auf dem Particl Marketplace standardmäßig als RingCT-Überweisungen abgewickelt werden. Der beste Weg um den RingCT-Pool zu erhöhen, liegt in einer Steigerung der Transaktionsaktivität des Marktplatzes und damit einhergehend der Nutzung des Protokolls, das durch den Marktplatz selbst langfristig zu einer extrem soliden Basis verholfen wird.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses-verdeckte-adressen\">Stealth Addresses – Verdeckte Adressen</h2><p>Particl ermöglicht es darüber hinaus, dass alle Nutzer verdeckte (stealth) Adressen, anstelle von öffentlichen (public) Adressen verwenden. Diese Adressen sind sogenannte \"one-time\" Adressen, was nicht bedeutet, dass sie nur einmal verwendet werden können, sondern beim Empfang von mehreren Zahlungen jedes Mal gesondert eine neue, einzigartige 'one-time' Adresse für den Output der Überweisung generieren.  </p><p>Ohne die Kenntnis des privaten Schlüssels (private key) einer Adresse, ist es für einen außenstehenden Beobachter unmöglich, die Outputs einer verdeckten (stealth) Adresse zuzuordnen und hilft so dabei, die Identität eines Zahlungsempfängers zu schützen.</p><p>Verdeckte (stealth) Adressen sind als solche noch kein vollständiger Schutz um alle Details einer Überweisung zu verschleiern, insbesondere dann nicht, wenn jemand genügend Ressourcen und Motivation aufbringt. Verdeckte Adressen entfalten vor allem im Zusammenspiel mit stärkeren Anonymisierungstechniken wie CT und RingCT ihre ganzes Potential. Sowohl vertrauliche (blind) als auch anonyme (anon) Überweisungen können nur an verdeckte (stealth) Adressen gesendet werden.</p><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-ein-perfektes-team\">CT + RingCT — Ein perfektes Team</h2><p>Beide Anonymisierungstechniken haben ihre eigenen Vor- und Nachteile. Ein wesentlicher Unterschied von CT und RingCT besteht darin, dass CT programmierbare Outputs hat, RingCT nicht. Dies hat zur Folge, dass RingCT selbst nicht in komplexeren Skripten eingesetzt werden kann; jedoch in dezentralisierten Anwendungen (dApps), wie dem Open Marketplace von Particl. Das ist einer der wesentlichen Gründe, warum beide Protokolle weiterhin Anwendung im Netzwerk finden, und nicht nur eins der beiden.</p><p>Da CT-Überweisungen einen programmierbaren Output haben, können sie in Smart-Contracts eingesetzt und mit RingCT-Überweisungen verbunden werden. Im Falle von Particls Implementierung können daher Outputs von RingCT zu CT konvertiert, und somit für andere Skripte (bspw. in Smart-Contracts) genutzt werden, und im Anschluss wieder zu RingCT rücküberwiesen werden. </p><p>Beispielhaft für die Synergieffekte beider Protokolle kann die Funktionsweise des  Marktplatzes von Particl gelten. Der Particl Marketplace ist \"private-by-default\". Das bedeutet, dass datenschutzfreundliche Voreinstellungen standardmäßig alle Teilbereiche der Anwendung durchdringen und die Privatsphäre seiner Nutzer schützt. RingCT wird für alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz genutzt, um diese zu verbergen und so eine komplett anonyme Nutzung zu ermöglichen. </p><p>Wusstest du, dass der Marktplatz beide Protokolle kombiniert - RingCT für die Überweisung und CT für den Smart-Contract - um Particls dezentrales Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem (Escrow) zu ermöglichen?</p><p>Das hat den einfachen Grund, dass die Funktionalität des Treuhandsystems auf einem Smart-Contract basiert und folglich programmierbare Outputs benötigt. Da alle Überweisungen auf dem Marktplatz mittels RingCT ablaufen, müssen Nutzer eine RingCT-Überweisung in den Smart-Contract schicken, die dort automatisch von RingCT zu CT konvertiert wird. Sobald beide Parteien - Verkäufer und Käufer - den hinterlegten Treuhandbetrag freigeben, wird dieser wieder von CT zu RingCT konvertiert und zurückerstattet.</p><blockquote>\"Ein RingCT-Output wird in einen CT-Output konvertiert, der wiederum Grundlage des Inputs für den Treuhandvertrag darstellt. Wenn der Kauf abgeschlossen und der Treuhandvertrag erfüllt ist, wird es umgehend konvertiert und wieder als RingCT-Output erstattet.\" — <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\">Kewde</a>, Particl Entwickler und <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\">OMP Library</a> Author</blockquote><p>Dies ist nur ein Beispiel, wie RingCT sein vollständiges Potential mittels des CT-Protokolls abruft und damit einen tiefgreifenden Einfluss auf das Particl-Netzwerk hat sowie vielseitige Anwendungsbereiche für die Codebasis von Bitcoin aufzeigen kann.</p><hr><p>Willst du mehr über Particl, die Plattform und den Particl Marketplace erfahren? <br><br>Behalte <a href=\"http://particl.news/\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Particl.news</strong></strong></strong></strong></a> im Auge und bleib auf dem neuesten Stand.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
