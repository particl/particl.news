series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n, we touched on the progressive evolution of atomic swap technology, bringing us\nall the way to a comprehensive atomic swap-based DEX framework that is able to\nsupport coins with no scripting language support, such as Part(Anon) and XMR.\nThis, of course, plays towards our eventual goal to integrate the BasicSwap\nprotocol into other access gateways, most notably a web-based DEX and a\nseamlessly integrated Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] \nintegration, in an ongoing effort to bring truly decentralized, private\ne-commerce to the widest audience possible.\n\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol already boasts a wide array of different coins,\neach with their own advantages and communities, two big pieces are still being\nconsidered for integration into BSX: stablecoins, and the extremely popular\nEthereum ecosystem. Of course, being able to integrate the latter would\nimmediately make the integration of a number of stablecoins trivial, as many\nstablecoins already exist as ETH tokens.\n\nThese are some thoughts on what a PART(Anon)-ETH and XMR-ETH swap integration\ninto a comprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap could look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Existing XMR-ETH Swap\n\nPeople who had the pleasure to witness Elizabeth Bink [https://github.com/noot]\n’s Monerotopia presentation on XMR-ETH swaps may have developed a curiosity\ntowards hyper-private Ethereum swaps and what they entail, perhaps most\nimportantly in the hopes of facilitating untraceable, decentralized swaps\nbetween privacy coins and stablecoins (or simply ETH itself).\n\nElizabeth and the open source project AthanorLabs\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] achieved the first XMR-ETH atomic\nswap earlier this year, and presented it to the world at the Monerotopia\nconference in Mexico City, on May 6th. Using their own breakthrough protocol,\nAthanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring\nto the table, to achieve for the first time a bona fide atomic swap between the\ntwo currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations\nto integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap\nworks and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly\nmore interesting for our purposes.\n\nUnder The Hood\nXMR, of course, and as we’ve discussed at length\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic HTLC swap\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], where both coins need some\nbasic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.\n\nETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people\nfamiliar with the semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4] \nthat the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that\nthe “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nAs it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless\nadaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of\ntoday fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is\nthat Ethereum is account-based\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/], and not UTXO-based.\n\nThe Challenges of an Account-based Architecture\nIn short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to\ndecrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account\nbalance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based\ntransaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique nonce\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp]. To that end, the nonce is\npublicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that\nthe same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.\n\nThis breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires\nrefund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a\ntransaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could\nthen send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and\nwhen the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed\ntransaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).\n\nPre-signing in adaptor signature swapsAthanorLab's solution is to make use of\nEthereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the\nswap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless\n- but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the\nnecessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by\nthe powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC\n(where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than\nadaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the\nside without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other\ntransaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the\ntransaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even\nwith sophisticated chain analysis tools.\n\nSo, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal\nlogic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds —\nincluding Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both\ninadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a\nfull integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.\n\nA snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG networkCurrent\nProtocol Limitations\nAn important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is\nthat ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in.\nThat means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only\none side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. \n\nThe RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund\nin case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks\nfirst, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder\nlocks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked\nforever. This means that the swap itself always has to be structured in one way,\nwith XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at\nthe protocol level.\n\nAnother underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even\nadvertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the\nEthereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided\nfor by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another\nreason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder\nto lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could\neasily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or\nmultiple offers, and back out.\n\nThis unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's\nparameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective\nquantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have\nlittle say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the\npreferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. \n\nAthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interfaceLooking Ahead\nMuch like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, BasicSwap's intention is to leverage\nthe SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed\nXMR-ETH swap protocol.\n\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nRemember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps\ndidn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic\nswap protocol.

Since then, we've made substantial\nstrides across all aspects of the Particl ecosystem, particularly in regards to\nBasicSwap DEX, our latest privacy-first and pro-liberty dApp.\n\nHere's a snapshot of our accomplishments and noteworthy news since the\ninitiation of the third funding cycle.\n\n * Publication of Particl’s whitepaper (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/])\n * Launch of BasicSwap’s open beta (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/])\n * Multiple subsequent BasicSwap GUI updates (1\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-available/], 2\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-0-1-available/], 3\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/])\n * Deployment of rudimentary BSX liquidity and market making tool (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/])\n * Particl Desktop 3.3 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-mainnet/] and \n   3.3.1 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-1-now-available/]\n * 9 Particl Core releases (1 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]\n   , 2 [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Core 25.x latest version (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-core-25rc1-released/])\n * Attended and gave presentations at Monerotopia\n   [https://staging.particl.news/basicswap-monerotopia-presentation/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-goes-to-monerotopia/] and Monerokon\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-talk-at-monerokon/]\n * New BasicSwap.com [https://basicswap.com] website and upcoming Particl.io\n   [https://particl.io] revamp\n * Breakthrough bidirectional Monero atomic swaps (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n   )\n * PART added to the mobile Stack Wallet (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/])\n * Particl blockchain’s yearly coin emission rate reduced (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/part-coin-emission-rate-reduced/])\n\nItems in Progress and Current Main Priorities\nIn addition to the aforementioned completed milestones, we’re currently actively\nworking on a couple of major items that align with Particl's ultimate vision.\nOur objective is to complete or make major progress on these during the\nforthcoming funding cycle while simultaneously working on various smaller\ndeliverables.\n\n * Getting PART listed on better exchanges to ease access into the ecosystem and\n   improve general market health\n * Web framework and integration layer for BasicSwap DEX and Particl Marketplace\n * Seller app (Particl Marketplace)\n * Messaging layer agnosticism for BasicSwap DEX\n * New coin integrations into BasicSwap\n * SMSG 2.0 (still in research phase, not in active development)\n\n> Note: Just like any roadmap or medium-term planning, modifications to our plans\nmay occur due to a variety of factors, such as, among others, emerging\nopportunities and changes in funding scenarios or team composition adjustments.\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 12 months\n\nThis funding request proposes a monthly claim of 35,250 PART from the Treasury\nFund for a 12-month period to support the Particl team and fund its operations.\nFollowing the end of this period, the proposal will need to be renewed and\nreceive the approval of Particl stakeholders once again to claim further funds.\n\nAs with the previous proposal, the team has chosen to claim funds for an entire\nyear to ensure steady support for current endeavors and ease the logistics\nassociated with potential external funding possibilities and hiring processes.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to enhance the\necosystem and its dApps. An example of such endeavour was Particl's recent\nparticipation at both Monerotopia and Monerokon a few months ago.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nRegarding External Funding\nThe Particl team is exploring several external funding options and is\ncontinuously assessing various proposals we receive related to third-party\nmarket liquidity or capital injections. This aims to supplement the funds drawn\nfrom the network's treasury by either providing non-PART funds to the team or\nbuilding a healthier PART landscape and a more liquid market environment for\neveryone.\n\nWhile we remain flexible and open to innovative solutions in this aspect, we are\nacutely aware of any potential impacts such initiatives could have on the\nproject, market, and community. Thus, we're taking a cautious and deliberate\napproach, and cannot provide any guarantees regarding the outcomes of these\ninitiatives if none ultimately prove beneficial to the project and its\ncommunity.\n\n> Note: This proposal has been created under the assumption that no external funds\nwill be raised, and it is sufficient to cover the team’s fundamental ongoing\nexpenses\nHow to Vote\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running the latest version of\nPartyman.

Our objective is to complete or make major progress on these during the forthcoming funding cycle while simultaneously working on various smaller deliverables.</p><ul><li><strong>Getting PART listed on better exchanges</strong> to ease access into the ecosystem and improve general market health</li><li><strong>Web framework</strong> and integration layer for BasicSwap DEX and Particl Marketplace</li><li><strong>Seller app</strong> (Particl Marketplace)</li><li>Messaging layer <strong>agnosticism</strong> for BasicSwap DEX</li><li><strong>New coin integrations </strong>into BasicSwap</li><li><strong>SMSG 2.0</strong> (still in research phase, not in active development)</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>Just like any roadmap or medium-term planning, modifications to our plans may occur due to a variety of factors, such as, among others, emerging opportunities and changes in funding scenarios or team composition adjustments.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-funding-request-in-detail\">The Funding Request in Detail</h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months</li></ul><p>This funding request proposes a <strong>monthly claim of 35,250 PART</strong> from the Treasury Fund for a <strong>12-month period </strong>to support the Particl team and fund its operations. Following the end of this period, the proposal will need to be renewed and receive the approval of Particl stakeholders once again to claim further funds.</p><p>As with the previous proposal, the team has chosen to claim funds for an entire year to ensure steady support for current endeavors and ease the logistics associated with potential external funding possibilities and hiring processes.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\">Funding Distribution Breakdown</h3><p>Given the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily allocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as cover various operational expenses.</p><p>Should the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be accumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of marketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to enhance the ecosystem and its dApps. An example of such endeavour was Particl's recent participation at both Monerotopia and Monerokon a few months ago.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"regarding-external-funding\">Regarding External Funding</h3><p>The Particl team is exploring several external funding options and is continuously assessing various proposals we receive related to third-party market liquidity or capital injections. This aims to supplement the funds drawn from the network's treasury by either providing non-PART funds to the team or building a healthier PART landscape and a more liquid market environment for everyone.</p><p>While we remain flexible and open to innovative solutions in this aspect, we are acutely aware of any potential impacts such initiatives could have on the project, market, and community. Thus, we're taking a cautious and deliberate approach, and cannot provide any guarantees regarding the outcomes of these initiatives if none ultimately prove beneficial to the project and its community.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>This proposal has been created under the assumption that no external funds will be raised, and it is sufficient to cover the team’s fundamental ongoing expenses</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"how-to-vote\">How to Vote</h2><p>To cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold staking application and register your vote on the blockchain for <code class=\"language-text\">proposal #19</code>. </p><p>You have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
