This would, notably, fix some launch issues\nthat have been happening with some OS environments such as Manjaro or Fedora\nLinux distributions.\n\nToday, we can report that the base changes are mostly sorted out and that there\nare 2 changes left before we can officially mark this task as completed:\n\n 1. Complete the marketplace tests (ensuring that all updated dependencies work\n    as expected);\n 2. Complete the ZMQ-related changes for electron to ensure that Particl Desktop\n    works without issues on Windows.\n\nOnce those changes are done, we'll start the process of building Particl Desktop\nacross the different platforms and then test that all the expected functionality\nworks within these environments. We expect to get started on that during the\ncourse of next week. \n\nOnce everything is tested and confirmed to be ready, we'll create test builds\nfor internal testing, and if no issues are detected, then we'll end up releasing\nthis as Particl Desktop 3.2.1.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

We've made, once again, some good progress on both the DEX's user\ninterface and the ability to pick up multiple or fraction of orders from its\norder book, although that feature is not fully ready yet.\n\nListing Seeding Proposal\nWith product codes now integrated into Particl Desktop 3.2, we can now move\nahead with the marketplace listing seeding CCS proposal\n[http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nAs a reminder, this CCS proposal, headed by Arnold Bansemer and Cryptoguard,\naims at populating the marketplace with a significant number of listings and\nautomating some of the processes involved with the publishing of listings and\nprocessing of orders.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we'll have the first iteration of this proposal ready after\nwhich point we'll iterate it over and improve as we move ahead.

progress report has come.\nThis week has been a continuation of the previous endeavors mentioned in the\nmost recent development updates with more time spent on finalizing the details\nof Particl's upcoming major development cycle coming after Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump into the details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nAs we near the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.1, we've been finishing up with\nthe two remaining issues and running tests to ensure their integration. So far,\nwe've picked up a small issue in relation to the Electron dependency update in\nParticl Desktop, and we'll be addressing that this weekend and going into next\nweek.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAside from the usual and steady progress made to the upcoming DEX's user\ninterface, this week we've been exploring different ways to get a Bitcoin node\nsynced up rapidly.\n\nFor reference, while BasicSwap connects directly to a Monero public node, it\nrequires a full node for both Bitcoin and Particl to function. And while syncing\nthe Particl blockchain is not so tedious, syncing the whole Bitcoin chain can\ntake quite a lot of time. \n\nAnd so, to ensure the best user experience and as few adoption obstacles as\npossible, we've started looking at different options to circumvent that process.\nAt this time, we've identified one solution that would work relatively well and\nvery significantly cut the time required to get BasicSwap ready to swap Bitcoin,\nbut we'd like to test it more before we're ready to announce it.\n\nIn other BasicSwap news, we are almost ready to push a bunch of changes to the\nDEX's protocol that will allow users to pick up multiple orders from the order\nbook or fractions of orders. We are putting the final touches on this update and\nwill be pushing the code shortly!\n\nPlanning Ahead for the Upcoming Major Evolutionary Phase of Particl\nAs we've mentioned in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/], we are planning on\nbeginning with Particl's next evolutionary process right after the release of\nParticl Desktop 3.3. This process will not only introduce a new layer of\ndistributed services to the ecosystem and bring Particl up to par with the\nexpected level of accessibility from Web3 apps, but it will also improve said\nWeb3 in many ways by tackling some of its most urgent issues, as we've\nhighlighted in this Particl Story\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/].\n\nIn fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to\nmake the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers,\nvendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable\nwith established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work,\nand more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3\necosystem and community.\n\nWhile we are still spending time to finalize the details of this significant\nevolutionary phase, we are now almost ready to publicly reveal the big plans\nwe've got lined up for Particl going forward and we'll be announcing it very\nshortly on Particl News with a comprehensive and in-depth blog post. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
