As we\nnavigated through this task, we identified a few minor issues in both the\ncodebase and GUI, which we have been diligently investigating and fixing.\n\nA notable issue we encountered involved the display of blockchain transaction\nfees on BasicSwap, which differed from the actual on-chain fee. This discrepancy\nrequired substantial time to investigate and ultimately led to a comprehensive\noverhaul of the DEX protocol's fee estimation\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commit/0432fae5b5f3672e142dfd9283201e25069796e8]\n. This modification is now complete.\n\nAt this time, we continue to test the new bi-directional Monero atomic swaps and\nfind ourselves in the final stages of this process, steadily moving towards\ncompletion.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've also been implementing a series of small cosmetic changes and additional\ncode clean-up on the DEX's GUI. We anticipate merging these modifications into\nthe live version shortly, resulting in a minor user interface update.\n\nNew Particl Website ✅\nWe've also been making significant progress on the new website, which we now\nexpect to have a working version in internal testing in the next couple of days.\nLive launch should follow shortly after that!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

solutions without central points of failure in\norder to bring the industry back to its roots and core ethos — namely, privacy\nand decentralization. \n\nAs it stands, the increasingly centralized and corporate infrastructure of\ncrypto not only renders it more vulnerable to attacks, but it also gives\ngovernment entities such as the SEC an incredibly powerful vector of control. To\nthat end, it can be stated that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized\nand potentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the previous installment\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n\nof this series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, we discussed the history and development of atomic swap technologies, and the\ntechnical peculiarities and challenges of integrating them within a\ncomprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap DEX. Similar challenges are also\npresent in bringing the BasicSwap protocol towards web accessibility, which we\nwill explore in this article.\n\nA Foundation for Private and Accessible DEX Environments\nBasicSwapDEXMeet BasicSwap, the privacy-first and cross-chain DEX. Swap coins\nlike Bitcoin and Monero on a trading platform that’s free, unstoppable, and\nconfidential. By the Particl Project.BasicSwapDEX [https://basicswapdex.com/]\nThose familiar with the early beta of the BasicSwap protocol\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/] understand that,\nwhile the technology is incredibly powerful and allows for probably the easiest\nXMR-BTC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE] or\nPart(ANON)-BTC decentralized swaps available anywhere\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE], it is at the cost of a relatively\ninvolved process. For example, unless you wish to swap a coin pair which\nblockchains you have already downloaded, the time necessary to get a new\nblockchain up to speed can be impractical for many users. Furthermore, simply\naccessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and\nattention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for\nmany.\n\nThankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably a more\nstraightforward and less complicated install process\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-] \n— are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but\nparticularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on\nthe BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the\nBasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror\nto the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users\nto connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light\nservices or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have\nto pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third\nparties involved at any point.\n\nIn addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap\napplication already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important\nfeature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of\nadditional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current\ndevelopment focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized HTLC and Adaptor Sig\nswaps [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] available on the BSX\nnetwork. \n\nThe goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a\nplug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps,\nwhich addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on\nthe other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience\nthat characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.\n\nOur Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways\n\nTo honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap\nprotocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.\n\nFirst of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with\nregards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some\nof the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must\nkeep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from\nthe convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general\ntransparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses,\nsmart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and\npeer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.\n\nA second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based\nBasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web\nusers to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order\nbook, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private\norder books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end,\ninvesting development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and\nincentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be\ninstrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based\nDEX.\n\nThirdly, continuing our commitment to modular software architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] will ensure the\nexceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform\nvia the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG\nnetwork (1\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/])\nin the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high\nexpectations of BasicSwap DEX. This design philosophy also makes the platform\nmore scalable, both at the gateway level and at the protocol level.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeveloping the Economy of Tomorrow\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol itself is still in beta and that many of the\nnecessary building blocks towards a smooth, user-friendly atomic swap web DEX\nare still in the works, behind-the-scenes development of BasicSwap is going\nsplendidly, and a working beta of such a revolutionary web-based exchange\nplatform is well in progress. Be sure to stay tuned to our twitter\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1677371987675471890] to stay up to\ndate with our weekly Friday development reports!\n\nAddressing the peculiarities of a web-based BasicSwap gateway also brings us\ncloser to its integration into the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], which will allow for seamless swaps between\nother digital currencies and the $PART settlement coin. This aims to bring\ndeCommerce to unprecedented levels of accessibility and resilience, even\nallowing users to compound the privacy benefits of multiple cryptos and swapping\nprotocols — a formidable building block towards a common, truly decentralized\nfinancial system open to all.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their\nhistory, make sure to give these articles a read!\n\n * Atomic Swap Style Showdown [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 3\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-private-ethereum-swaps/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
