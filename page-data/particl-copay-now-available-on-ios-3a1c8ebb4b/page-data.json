No new features is currently\nbeing implemented until the Alpha build is made entirely stable. Having a super\nstable build will make integrating new features on it much faster and easier and\nshould lead to more regular (and exciting) releases.\n\nThe Alpha Version Moves Up to Mainnet\nOnce the testnet Alpha version of the marketplace is fully stable and thoroughly\ntested, it will be moved up onto Particl’s mainnet, allowing you to purchase and\nsell real items using real PART coins. This milestone event will mark the end of\nthe Alpha phase of development and initiate the Beta phase.\n\nLimited Features\nThis first ever mainnet version of Particl’s Open Marketplace won’t require any\nsort of hardfork and will only contain a limited set of features. The features\navailable will be the same features that have been on testnet for some time.\nThis includes decentralized governance with coin weight, as well as the complete\nbuy and sell flow. Community proposals, although not directly a marketplace\nfeature, will also be live on mainnet.\n\nNo Privacy Enhancing Features in This Version\nIt’s very important to note that this mainnet version won’t be coupled with the\nRingCT hardfork yet, meaning that the MAD escrow system won’t be enhanced with\nit. This means that all marketplace transactions made on this version of the\nmarketplace will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is hardforked onto\nmainnet and integrated into the escrow system during Beta. You can rest assured,\nhowever, that no other data will be generated by the marketplace.\n\nThe Beta Phase Will be Focused on Adding New Features\nNew features will be introduced during the Beta phase and will be integrated\ninto existing testing builds as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nRelease Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of\nfeatures are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused on building the base layer for the marketplace, Beta\nwill be focused on integrating new features. A fully stable marketplace codebase\nwill result in quicker releases with something new to show for almost everytime,\nand it should also be a much more exciting phase for everyone than Alpha.\n\nBeta Starts as Soon as Alpha Ends\nThe Beta phase of development will start immediately after the Alpha phase is\ncompleted and moved onto mainnet. The next build that will follow the first\nmainnet version of the Open Marketplace will be a Beta build and will be\nreleased, like Alpha was up until the end, on testnet.\n\nTwo Development Branches Used During Beta\nDuring Beta, two types of branches, Development and Stable, will be used to push\ntestnet builds to the community.\n\nDevelopment Branch\n\nThe Development branch will be the first place where new features will be\navailable for community testing. Because introducing new features almost\ninevitably introduces bugs and issues, this may mean the Development branch\nmight not be super stable all the time. This is not ideal to get a good number\nof testers (if it’s broken all the time, people are less interested in testing\nthe builds) and to show friends. After all, what’s worse than showing a friend a\nbuild of Particl’s Open Marketplace only for it to crash in your face).\n\nStable Branch\n\nThis is where the Stable branch comes in. This branch will be used to push\nfeatures that have already went through a good number of tests and that have\nbeen fixed of most bugs and issues. While the Stable branch is still a testnet\nbranch, it will make builds much more stable and easy to share with friends.\nThis branch is the final step before a feature is introduced onto mainnet.\n\nA Feature’s Path to Mainnet\nWith this new strategy, a feature now has to go through one additional hoop\nbefore being implemented on mainnet. It first needs to be tested internally by\nthe team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of\nmost of its bugs and issues, the feature gets implemented onto the Stable branch\nfor its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be\nintegrated onto mainnet.\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nThis mainnet release marks an important milestone for Particl. It separates it\nfrom the group forming the majority of blockchain projects that do not have any\nsort of product ready at this time and gives it an entry ticket into a much more\nlimited category of projects that have a product live on mainnet. What’s more,\nit will signify the beginning of a brand new phase for the project and the\ncommunity as it will now be easier than ever to spend cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
