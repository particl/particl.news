It also includes a wide variety of bug fixes, general improvements,\nand quality-of-life tweaks that makes the user experience much better and\nhassle-free. Check out the full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0].\n\n> Note: Important in this update is the addition of two new buttons. One, in the\nOrders section, lets you resend your last action (i.e., mark the item as\nshipped) in case it hasn't properly been received by the other party. The other,\nin the Market Settings, lets your client rescan previous actions by the other\nparty, in case that it is your client that failed to receive it.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Fixes various typos, incorrect button labels, and incorrect text/label\n   related concerns.\n * Update to using core v0.21.\n\n> Note that for new users, a default wallet is not automatically created, and so\nthe initial wallet generation (when using the wallet module as the first entry\npoint) will allow for a wallet name to be provided.\n> The particl-core setting txindex will be explicitly enabled by automatically\nupdating the particl.conf file.\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Allow for backing up the market profile mnemonic and passphrase. These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience.

These are generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.</li></ul><blockquote>Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so backing up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile are backed up as well.</blockquote><ul><li>Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.</li><li>Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the sender's machine.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search criteria under certain cases.</li><li>When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop receiving smsg for that market.</li><li>Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees slightly.</li><li>A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the sending of smsg.</li><li>The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it contains.</li><li>Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market service was starting up.</li><li>Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater visibility when a value is missing.</li><li>The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.</li><li>The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.</li><li>In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed) is shown alongside the refresh button.</li><li>Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).</li></ul><blockquote>Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes afterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to occur.</blockquote><ul><li>Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of items in the batch publish modal.</li><li>Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:</li></ul><blockquote>This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor) as well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for further details).<br><br>These values can be viewed in the listings detail window.<br><br>Do note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's details as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when non-standard escrow ratios are used.<br><br>Orders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any additional information that may be needed.</blockquote><ul><li>A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.</li><li>Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.</li></ul><h3 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h3><ul><li>Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.</li><li>Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored and for the user to regain access to their coins.</li><li>Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.</li><li>A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default value used.</li><li>Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.</li><li>Fixes an issue in using a very high <code class=\"language-text\">inputs_per_sig</code> value on anon related transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.</li><li>Updates the <code class=\"language-text\">locked</code> balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc command <code class=\"language-text\">getlockedbalances</code> for this purpose. The previous means attempted to calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong values.</li><li>Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview page).</li><li>Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative measure.</li><li>Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value. The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.</li><li>The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.</li></ul><blockquote>The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the initial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.</blockquote><ul><li>The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per transaction.</li></ul><hr><p>Particl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It improves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by introducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace vendors.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone” release, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial 3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a new dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information about what items are planned to be included in the next update in a follow-up blog post that will be published to Particl News very shortly.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

We can obviously point the finger at climate changes, but data centers,\n   especially in the western half of the United States, have a big portion of\n   the blame to take as well.\n * 30% of all data centers in the world are located in the USA, many in the\n   western half of it.\n * Tax breaks may help build data centers\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/arizona-passes-data-center-tax-breaks/] \n   but just who takes the responsibility to monitor the depletion of rivers,\n   lakes, and groundwater reservoirs these data centers cause?\n * In the U.S., the daily water consumption by data centers that report such\n   figures exceeds 1.7 billion liters of water.\n * This number is expected to only be 1/3rd of their actual consumption as it\n   only monitors the water consumption of their cooling systems.\n * Amazon, for example, does not bother measuring or reporting the water usage\n   of their data centers, a worrying fact considering Amazon’s AWS service is\n   powered by one of the biggest data center networks in the country\n   [https://www.wpoven.com/blog/aws-market-share/]. And don’t forget, Amazon’s\n   data consumption isn’t limited to AWS; its cloud outlets, Alexa product and,\n   of course, its Amazon.com [/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/Amazon.com] \n   marketplace, all require massive data warehouses to hold and process the\n   amount of data they collect.\n * And then, one out of five data centers is placed near a water reservoir which\n   is already stressed because of the nearby population. Water cooling is\n   cheaper than air cooling and it uses less energy, sure, but it creates water\n   shortages which tend to often be kept out of the public environmental debate.\n * Arizona for example, which is one of the hottest and driest states in the\n   U.S., is trying to become a new Silicon Valley. However, it relies on Lake\n   Mead (Hoover Dam) which is currently at a record low of 35% capacity\n   [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/06/10/lake-mead-water-lowest-hoover-dam-built-colorado-river-shortage/7640437002/]\n   . To make things worse, the Colorado River has lost 18% of its flow! But\n   still, companies are granted tax breaks, rebates, and promises of access to\n   water by some of the same people who claim to be fighting for the\n   environment.\n * Apple\n   [https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/10/apple-plans-major-expansions-at-arizona-and-nevada-data-centers]\n   , Google\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/mesa-council-approves-1bn-google-arizona-data-center-16m-tax-breaks/]\n   , Facebook\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/huge-data-center-moves-forward-in-mesa-despite-arizona-water-concerns/]\n   , and many other tech giants are already in Arizona, and are starting to\n   expand. That'll require more and more of that already rare water in the\n   region.\n * In Texas, Google requests 6.64 billion liters of water per year. Yes, a\n   single data center uses 10% of all its region’s water reserves which contains\n   20 towns.\n * In the meantime, Dallas encourages its citizens (that’s you, the individual)\n   to use less water as their six reservoirs are 18% depleted. They have a\n   mandatory water restriction in place once this number hits 35%, but they\n   welcome with open arms the insane water requests from tech giants.\n * At least, some tech giants like Microsoft report the water consumption on\n   their cooling systems (but not their total water consumption). That’s unlike\n   Amazon, Google, and Facebook who don’t bother to release any numbers to the\n   public [https://time.com/5814276/google-data-centers-water/].\n * In fact, most of them have 'non-disclosure agreements' NDAs with water\n   companies and local governments\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/after-aquifer-concerns-googles-600m-south-carolina-expansion-finds-new-water-supply/]\n   , to make sure their actual water usage stays a secret. Oh, the hypocrisy!\n\nThat’s a lot to take in, right?

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
