This marks a significant moment in Particl history as the end\nresult is a new, more powerful self-funding mechanism for the ecosystem.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go through the timeline for the\ncoming weeks as the new decentralized treasury makes its way on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nThe Decentralized Treasury Proposal vote, the first-ever “protocol consensus\nchanging vote”, was an important milestone for Particl because it proposed\napplying critical changes to the protocol. Indeed, the proposal suggested\nraising the yearly PART coin emission rate from 2% to 8%, with half of the\nstaking rewards being automatically deposited into a treasury fund by the\nprotocol.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mind-blowing 96.6% approval rate (minimum required was 75%) and a \n70.6% participation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 10,080\nblocks, with 6,884 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 239 voting\nagainst it.\n\nThe participation rate for this voting round increased by ~7% compared to the\nprevious (and first) proposal that required a vote. This is an incredibly\nencouraging news in light of Particl’s transition into a community governed\nproject and shows just how active its stakeholders are.\n\nWhen Will it Go Live?\nNow that the results are official and that the decentralized treasury model has\nbeen approved, it can now be deployed on the Particl blockchain. For this to\nhappen requires a hardfork which relies on two deliverables.\n\nThe first one is, obviously, the integration of the decentralized treasury code\ninto the blockchain. The code for the changes has been completed and the build\nis now going through a thorough testing process on a side network (Particl clone\nnetwork).\n\nThe second deliverable is the integration of the output whitelist into the\nblockchain. This is tied to the output claim process which is currently ongoing.\nAs a reminder, the pre-fork process ends on June 21st, 2021. If you want your\ntemporarily disabled anon and blind outputs to be re-enabled in the coming\nhardfork, make sure you’ve read read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/] and submit your claim\nbefore that date, if needed.\n\nOnce the cutoff date of the claim period is reached, the final pre-fork output\nwhitelist will be bundled with the next Particl Core release and be submitted to\nexchanges so they can start the process of preparing for the coming hardfork. \n\nIf all goes well, Particl should be forking on the 12th of July, 2021. This is\ncurrently a target, the actual hardfork may happen a bit before or after,\ndepending on how fast exchanges and partners get ready for the fork. As always,\nwe will keep you updated with any news on the regard.\n\nThe Team Funding Proposal Goes Live Early This Week\nPutting in place a decentralized treasury model was only a first step in funding\nback the current Particl team. The second step is another proposal that will\nrequest capital from the treasury fund to fund the team and its operations. This\nproposal isn’t unlike what anyone else in the community can bring forward, but\nit’ll be Particl’s first-ever proposal to request resources from the treasury\nfund.\n\nThe proposal will detail the team’s strategy moving forward and will explain how\nit intends on utilizing the funds it is claiming. The proposal will be published\nand begin its discussion phase in the early moments of the week, on the CCS\nplatform. Make sure to be around if you want to provide comments and feedback on\nthe team proposal!\n\nNow’s the Best Time to Get Involved\nNow that the decentralized treasury model is about to go live on mainnet, you\ncan prepare your proposals and get them ready to be published. If, in the past,\nyou’ve had projects or ideas for Particl but couldn’t get the required capital\nto start them up, you now possess all you need to overcome that hurdle.\n\nBecause every submitted proposal first requires a discussion phase, and then a\nvoting phase of a minimum of one week, don’t hesitate to let the community about\nyour idea as soon as possible. This would ensure that the ecosystem and treasury\nfund get used right from the start and that no time is wasted before this new\naddition to the protocol starts benefiting the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is very excited about the new decentralized treasury\nmodel and can’t wait to see what you all come up with in terms of initiatives,\nprojects, businesses, and services. Particl now possesses the tools and\nresources to make anything happen; the sky is now the limit. It is now up to\neach and every one of us, the Particl community members, to make Particl a\nresounding success.

It highlights all the progress made over Particl V3\nand indicates what the items that are going to be focused on next week and\nbeyond are.\n\nThis week's report is particularly positive as we can now officially announce\nthat the issue preventing a few Windows user to launch Particl Desktop has been\ncompletely resolved. There is now only one bug left to fix. We expect to be able\nto release a new testnet build, which will hopefully be the last one before\nmainnet, in the next few days.\n\nWithout further ado, here is a list of the items currently in progress and those\nremaining.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\nIssue With Bids Failing but Still Locking Funds for Escrow\nAn issue identified by the community causes, in some circumstances, bids to fail\nbut still lead to coins being \"soft-locked\" (or reserved) for escrow. This bug\nis expected to be resolved over the weekend or somewhere next week.\n\nMore details regarding this issue by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1777\n\nAdd a Governance Informational Section to Particl Desktop\nIntroduce an informational governance section to Particl Desktop to display\nproposals, voting progression, and results. This won’t allow you to vote\ndirectly on proposals, at least not yet, but it provides information on how to\nvote as well as information regarding upcoming, current, and past proposals (and\ntheir voting results).\n\nThe basic implementation of this module has now been drawn up and is waiting to\nbe implemented. There may still be additional iterations required, but this item\nis progressing well with no obstacle so far.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible. \n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. \n\nDelete a Product From the Inventory\nThis will let you delete products from your inventory if you don’t want them to\nbe displayed anymore. This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end\nspecific change.\n\nMarketplace Orders Export Functionality\nAdding a CSV export tool for orders from the Market > Sell > Orders page is\ncurrently being explored. This would enable sellers to export useful order\ninformation that might benefit from being fed into other stock systems.\n\nThis item has been temporarily de-prioritized due to this week's launch of the\nnew Particl V3 testnet build and the focus on newly reported issues from the\ntestnet. The developers will circle back to this item very shortly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're closer than ever and now clearly see the light at the end of the tunnel!\nWith a new (and hopefully final) testnet build on the horizon for the next few\ndays, we will need everyone to test it out and make sure it really is ready for\nmainnet. That's even more true if you've come across the Windows bug and\ncouldn't test the build before.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
