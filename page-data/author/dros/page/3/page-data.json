There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it and having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nUndesirable Content\nThis, however, introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to the content being\nput on there. After all, how can you prevent anyone from buying or selling\nanything when there are no rules and no central party with special permissions\nto moderate it? Giving special permissions/powers and allowing certain users to\ndelete content and hold such a strong position of power is a slippery slope and,\non a long enough timeline, ultimately a slow crawl back to the old ways where a\ncompany would run its own platform, impose its rules, and charge fees.\n\nBut this isn’t what Particl is about. No, Particl is about full decentralization\nand complete privacy. The recent years, with all of the data breaches like\nEquifax’s and the abuse of data like with the constant scandals involving\nFacebook, have shown without a doubt that the tech industry needs to evolve and\nstart protecting its users.\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nAnd, because data has become so valuable and such a big target for hackers, we\ncannot expect or trust centralized models such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and\ncentral parties, to effectively secure our data.\n\nThis is why Particl’s Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and\nprivate-by-default. Its “trustless” nature, meaning that you do not need to\ntrust any entity to behave honestly, ensures that none of your data can be\ncollected by any party other than the ones you transact with. It is, simply put,\nthe next logical step in the evolution of eCommerce technology. But like any new\ngroundbreaking technology, it also introduces new challenges. Keeping the\nmarketplace free from undesirable listings is one of them.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nTo fight off undesirable content, Particl has put in place a completely\ndecentralized and provably fair governance mechanism where anyone can vote off\nundesirable listings.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts:\n * Voting power ratio: 1 PART coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold at time of publishing: -9,000 PART (adjustable)\n * Need to be staking?: No\n * Fee for flagging an item: Less than 0.001 PART for the first person to flag,\n   free for additional flaggers\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDelisting Threshold\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first user marks a listing as undesirable,\nit gets taken into a queue of previously flagged listings where other users will\nbe able to either agree that it should be taken off the marketplace, or disagree\nand vote for it to remain listed. For a listing to be completely delisted, its\nscore needs to reach a certain negative threshold.\n\nParticl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit\nupvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users\nupvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain\nnegative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other\nusers. Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.\n\nParticl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes\nfor a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s\nscore. It also deletes the listing from the user’s personal instance of the\nclient (deleted locally, but not hidden globally until the listing reaches the\ndelisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely\ndecentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that\ncreated multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and\nregister fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP\naddress, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes.\n\nInstead, Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote, which makes it impossible to\ngame the system. If you want to add more power to your votes, you can do it in a\nlegitimate way: acquire more PART coins. No matter how many wallets you use, or\nno matter how many times you try changing your IP address, the system only takes\nthe “coin weight” into consideration when counting votes. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the network can influence governance outcomes.\n\nThe delisting threshold of the Particl Open Marketplace will be -9,000 during\nthe first mainnet version. That threshold can and will be adjusted on the way\nforward. It may take a few tweaks until the perfect ratio is reached, but\nbecause game-theory is impossible to test on testnet (because test coins don’t\nhold any value), it has to be tested out in the wild.\n\nGame-Theory\nAs you probably now realize, this mechanism is actually pretty simple, but it’s\nalso quite strong and effective. The reason behind this is the whole game-theory \naspect of it.\n\nTo have significant voting power and single-handedly influence votes, a user\nneeds to acquire a lot of coins. This can be quite expensive depending on the\nactive delisting threshold ratio (in the first mainnet version of the\nmarketplace, that threshold will be -9,000), and it only gets more expensive as\nthe platform starts getting more network effect.\n\nAnd because voters have a direct financial stake in the network, they are\ndirectly incentivized to behave correctly. If voters colluded with each other\nand started trolling or censoring the marketplace, that would arguably reduce\nthe value of the network and incur a net loss for all co-conspirators.\n\nAdditionally, if users do not pro-actively keep the public interface of the\nmarketplace clean, it might result in a platform filled with undesirable or\nspammy content, which would contribute to driving people away. That, too, would\nseverely reduce the potential network effect and would be a serious obstacle to\nParticl reaching a more mainstream audience.\n\nSince voters are users with a financial stake in the network, driving users away\nfrom the platform is not something being desired. That is especially true of a\nmarketplace — more users mean more products to buy (for buyers) and more\npotential customers to reach (for vendors). That is why keeping the interface\nclean is a small, but not insignificant, contribution each user can make to the\nnetwork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ\n * What’s the delisting threshold?\n * The delisting threshold is currently at -9,000 for the first mainnet version\n   of the Open Marketplace. This threshold can and will be adjusted moving\n   forward.\n\n—\n\n * Will listings disappear after I vote them off?\n * When you flag a listing, it is deleted locally, meaning that it is taken off\n   your own personal instance of the marketplace, but not for other users. A\n   listing is only delisted from everyone’s marketplace instance once it reaches\n   the delisting threshold.\n\n—\n\n * Do I need to be staking to vote?\n * No, coins do not need to be staking. Anyone with a coin can vote.\n\n—\n\n * Can I vote if my coins are stored on a hardware device?\n * Not initially, but hardware device support is something being considered for\n   later in the future.\n\n—\n\n * Is there a fee for flagging listings?\n * If you are the first user to flag a listing that has never been flagged\n   before, you will need to be a sub-cent fee (0.00x PART or less). If you are\n   flagging a listing that’s already been flagged before, then there is no fee\n   to be paid.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Then, on the 26th of July\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60?source=collection_home---4------3-----------------------]\n, a contest was initiated to make it more fun — every participant would win a\nfree limited edition Particl t-shirt as well as the chance to win one of 3 free\nTrezor hardware devices that the Particl team is giving away.\n\nIt can now be reported that a whopping 47 sets of Market Keys\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls] have been submitted during\nthat period! The submission period was scheduled to end today, on the 5th of\nAugust, at 14:00:00 UTC. This means the submission period is over, and the\nvoting process now begins.\n\nMarket Key Submissions [https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls]\nYou can't perform that action at this time. You signed in with another tab or\nwindow. You signed out in another tab or…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet‘s Get Voting\nNow’s the time to let your voice be heard. Now’s the time to let people know\nwhat set of Market Keys you want to see used as the default keys for the main\ninterface of the Particl Open Marketplace. In order to make the voting process\nas accessible as possible, we’re taking the process over two different\nplatforms: Particl’s Twitter page and the Particl community forum.\n\nThe first thing you’ll need to do before voting is opening Github to the pull\nrequest page of particl-market. This is where you’ll see all of the Market Key\nsubmissions. Then, simply have a look at the keys and note down the number of\nthe pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you want to submit. Once\nthat’s done, either head over to Twitter or the Particl community forum and cast\nyour vote! The voting period will end on the 8th of August at 4:00:00 (UTC).\n\n> Note: You can only pick Market Keys that have been submitted before the end of\nthe contest. That means you can only vote for pull request #406 to #458.\nTwitter\nVoting on Twitter isn’t really complicated. Simply click the link below to be\nredirected to the tweet used for the voting process, and write in the comment\nsection the number of the pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you’d\nlike to see win this contest. Make sure that the number of the pull request is\nclearly identified.\n\n> \nParticl Community Forum\nTo vote on the forum, simply click on the link below to be redirected to the\nthread used for the voting process and register your vote by writing the number\nof the pull request associated with the set of keys you want to win in the\ncomment section of the thread. If you do not have an account yet, the process of\ncreating one is fairly straight-forward.\n\nMarket Key Voting Thread\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\nOn the 17th of July, it was announced that the community could start creating\nand submitting sets of Market Keys on…\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]particl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\n\n> Note: You can vote on both Twitter and the Particl community forum. In that\ncase, you will be casting two votes and both will be registered.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrizes and How to Claim Them\nAside from being a big part of Particl’s history, there is no prize associated\nwith winning this contest. That’s because the Particl team wants people to vote\nwith their heart and to reduce the number of fraudulent votes.\n\nHowever, everyone that has submitted a set of Market Keys gets a free limited\nedition Particl t-shirt as well as the chance to win one of the three (3) free\nTrezor hardware wallets being given away.\n\nTrezor Winners\nThe three lucky community members who will walk out of this contest with one of\nthe three (3) free Trezor hardware wallets being given away will be announced on\nthe 8th of August, briefly after the voting period for the Market Keys end.\nWinners will be picked at random and will be announced on Twitter as well as on\nParticl’s chat platforms (Discord, Telegram, and Riot). Additionally, the\nwinners will be notified about it right from their pull request on Github as a\ncomment coming from Cryptoguard. Good luck everyone!\n\nClaim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, head over to Particl’s community forum by following the\nlink below and register using the Github application.

This build allows you to test the\nnewly introduced “anon” escrow. This escrow system makes all marketplace\ntransactions private-by-default thanks to a combination of the CT and RingCT\nprivacy protocols. This testnet build also contains a vast range of tweaks that\nhave been made to the user interface since the last testnet round.\n\nTo ensure that the code is as stable as it can be and free of any bugs, the\nParticl team is inviting you to participate in a bug bounty where you will be\nrewarded, in PART, if you find any bug within Particl Desktop and the Open\nMarketplace.\n\nSo let’s dive deeper into this bug hunting bounty!\n\n> Note: If any bug is found during this testing round, it will likely be fixed on\nthe spot in internal builds. New builds, batched with multiple bug fixes at\nonce, would then be posted throughout the duration of the bounty, meaning there\ncould potentially be more than one build published during the duration of this\nbug bounty. Reported bugs can only earn you a bounty payment if they’re being\nreported on the latest build publicly available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCatching Bugs\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple:\n\nLatest build version + location of the Report Bug button * Download the latest testnet build of the Open Marketplace. While there is a\n   working testnet version available here\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/], newer builds with\n   fixed bugs may be posted in the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org]. Always verify that\n   you are running the latest build by checking the #testing channel first.\n * Make a backup of your\n   configuration files, especially wallet.dat.\n * Run it on a clean\n   install (delete all your testnet configuration folders, including\n   Particl/testnet, Particl Desktop/testnet, and Particl Market). Please make\n   sure to backup any mainnet wallet.dat file you have before you do.\n * Report any bug or\n   issue by clicking on the bug icon on Particl Desktop. This will take you to\n   Particl Desktop’s Issue page on Github. Users need to follow the proper\n   template that automatically fills the text field when you create a new Issue.\n\nWhat’s Considered a Bug\nA bug is an unexpected behavior that breaks functionality. It needs to prevent\nusers from using a feature to its full extent. It can also be a miscalculation,\na behavior that causes wrong amounts to be transferred, or information that’s\ndisplayed incorrectly.\n\nBugs are separated into 3 categories: minor, medium, and critical.\n\nMinor bug ($25): A minor bug is any small unexpected outcome that doesn’t break\nthe build in any significant way, but still considerably impacts the user\nexperience in a negative way. A minor bug can be annoying, but won’t prevent you\nfrom accomplishing any action within the marketplace.\n\nA good example of a minor bug could be this one here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1619\n\nMedium bug ($50): A significant bug breaks the build or prevents you from\naccomplishing a certain action. They are more than just annoyances, they prevent\nyou from doing an action.\n\nAn example of what a medium bug could look like would be not being able to add\nan item to your cart, prices of items not showing up on any listing or a button\nthat wouldn’t do anything upon clicking on it.\n\nMajor bug ($100): A critical bug is a major issue that not only breaks the build\nand prevents you from accomplishing a task, but that also could result in a loss\nof funds or an incorrectly transferred amount.\n\nAn example of what a major bug could look like would be if the escrow system\nbreaks up and becomes unusable or sends the wrong amounts to the wrong users.\n\nNOTE: The Particl team has sole discretion over what level a bug is categorized\ninto. While the criteria are clear about what makes a bug a minor, medium, or\ncritical one, some bugs may not be as clear cut. In that scenario, Particl\ndevelopers will determine its level.\n\nWhat’s NOT Considered a Bug\nAlthough you may encounter issues, not all of them are considered as bugs. These\nissues may include:\n\n * A typo\n * An improvement suggestion\n * A button is not perfectly aligned\n * A small visual glitch\n * A styling issue\n * A perceived need to change/add buttons\n\nHow to Report an Issue on Github\nFor a bug to qualify for a bounty payment, it has to be properly reported on the\nParticl Desktop’s Issue page on Github and use the proper template that’s\nautomatically generated when clicking on New Issue. This helps developers\nunderstand the issue more quickly and reproduce it on their end so that it can\nbe fixed more rapidly.\n\nTo access Particl Desktop’s Issue page, simply click on the Bug icon located at\nthe bottom left corner of the Particl Desktop wallet. This will automatically\ntake you to the Github page where bugs and issues get reported. Once you are\nthere, simply click the green New Issue button. Alternatively, you can manually\nvisit this Github page by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new\n\n> Note: You will need a Github account to log issues and bugs.\nThe Fine Prints\n * All bug bounties are paid in PART\n * The bug hunting bounty will run for 7 days (from the 1st of August to the 8th\n   of August, 16:00:00 UTC)\n * Only bugs reported on Github using the proper reporting template can qualify\n   for bounty payment.\n * If the same bug is reported more than once, the bounty will be awarded to the\n   first user that reported the issue.\n * The Particl team has sole discretion on what level (minor, medium, or\n   critical) a bug is, and whether an issue is actually a bug or not.\n * Reported bugs need to be from the latest build available. Bugs on older\n   versions aren’t eligible for bounty payment. The latest version can be\n   downloaded from the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org].\n * There is an assessment period for each bug submission. Each reported bug\n   needs to be approved for bounty payment by the Particl team.\n * Payments will be done at the end of the bug bounty\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith that being said, good luck in your hunt for bugs, and see you on mainnet!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Testnet-Bug-Bounty/1-yt8oCJgUcMXk71DqSkOTog.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"earn-part-for-catching-bugs\">Earn PART for Catching Bugs</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Testnet-Bug-Bounty/1-S_fPVIak-t6K7ukw7LoCDA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl just started, on the 1st of August, the final testing round of the Open Marketplace before it moves up onto mainnet.

Disclaimer, the next few days are going to be\nPACKED!\n\nAugust 1st, 2019\nOn this day, Particl is initiating the last round of testing, on testnet, before\nthe Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet.

This bug bounty rewards testers in PART for\ntrying to break the Open Marketplace, one last time, before it goes onto mainnet\nand gets used with real funds.

This permanent bounty is aimed at rewarding users who find bugs,\nexploits, or vulnerabilities in the Particl code to securely disclose issues and\nget promptly rewarded for their hard work. This bounty, just like the testnet\nbounty for the Open Marketplace, ensures that Particl’s code is as secure and\nstable as possible when faced to various attack vectors.

This session will use the same concept as the session the day before, but this\ntime will be done in french. This session will also have a 200 PART airdrop\nwhich will be distributed equally among all participants who complete the\nfollowing steps:\nParticipate in the Hangout session\n\n * Participate in the Hangout session\n * Share your screen while testing the Open Marketplace\n * Create a listing and go through the process of selling an item OR purchase an\n   item and go through the entire buy flow\n * Write either your Telegram or Discord username on the Hangout chat so that an\n   admin can contact you later on to get your PART deposit address\n\nTo participate in this Hangout session, follow this link: \nhttps://hangouts.google.com/group/9K81RY78dDSpgukL9\n\nNote: Once over, the session will be published on Particl’s Youtube page.\n\nAugust 5th, 2019\nOn the 5th of August, the Market Key Generation Contest will be over and any\nsubmitted Market Key passed this date will not be accepted as part of the\ncontest. This date will also mark the beginning of the 2-day voting process\nwhere the Particl community will get the pick the one set of Market Keys that\nwill generate the main interface of the Particl Open Marketplace.

Why not give it a go?\n\nAugust 7th, 2019\nTwo days after the end of the Market Key submission period, at 18:00:00 UTC, the\nvoting period in which the community will pick the set of Market Keys it wants\nto use as the default Market Keys of the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nwill end. This will effectively decide what keys are going to be used once the\nfirst mainnet build of the Particl Open Marketplace will get compiled, and will\ngive Particl Desktop 2.0 its marketplace functionality.\n\nAugust 8th, 2019\nThe Particl Open Marketplace testnet bug bounty will end. The Particl developers\nwill then continue working to fix the identified bugs, if any, for the next few\nhours/days. On the same day, the set of Market Keys selected by the community\nwill be integrated into the codebase of the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nAugust 9th, 2019 - August 12th, 2019\nDuring this period of 4 days, the Particl development team will fix any\nidentified bugs and compile internal builds running on both testnet and mainnet\nto conduct the last round of internal testing. These builds will contain all the\npotential bug fixes resulting from the bug bounty, and will also run using the\ncommunity-generated set of Market Keys.\n\nAugust 12th, 2019 — The BIG Day\nThe 12th of August will be Particl’s biggest day to date. This is when the\nParticl Open Marketplace releases on mainnet, at 12:00:00 UTC. This is the\nmoment everybody’s been waiting for, and it’s just around the corner. Indeed, on\nthis day, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be pushed, with marketplace functionality,\nonto mainnet as a public release.\n\nThis will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services using\ncryptocurrencies in a way that preserves your digital privacy and personal data.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team Gets Shuffled\nBut wait, there’s more! Because the project is now in the middle of a phase\nswitch, the Particl team is getting reshuffled to focus more on Particl adoption\nand community building. This means a few members of the team are getting new\nroles and opportunities.\n\nParticl Gets a New Community Manager\nAugust 1st also marks the day where Particl gets a new Community Manager!\nIndeed, Guillaume Benayoun, most commonly known as Ben within the Particl\ncommunity, will join the team’s ranks as Particl’s Community Manager and\nAmbassador.\n\nBen has been a very active member ever since the very beginning of Particl and\nhas almost single-handedly built the Particl FR community. Ben is also behind \nParticl’s evening of presentations at CoinHouse\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a],\nParis, which took place on the 21st of February 2019. Click the links below to\nwatch the three presentations made on this evening.\n\n * Cold Staking & Cold Staking Pools, by Guillaume Benayoun\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crzskSfKTWk]\n * The Evolution of Global eCommerce, by Lina Seiche\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQrDPzUGYaY]\n * The Role of Intermediaries in Blockchain eCommerce, by Albin Cauderlier\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfUTKTSL2-I]\n\nAs part of his new role within the Particl team, Ben will work on growing the\nmain Particl community and make it more engaging. He will ensure there is always\na team member available to answer questions, moderate the community, and keep\nthe channels clean. Additionally, he will also help on user onboarding and the\ncreation of sub-communities to drive up the adoption of the Particl Open\nMarketplace. As with any other member of the Particl communications team, he\nwill also help in a lot of other areas touching communications.\n\nCryptoguard Gets a New Role\nCryptoguard, Particl’s former Community Manager, will now assume a more strategy\nand communications-focused role within the Particl team. He will take on some of\nPaul Schmitzer’s role in managing communications and crafting the strategies\nsurrounding it. He will still be around the community and work full-time on the\nproject, but this new position will probably mean he will have a more “in the\nbackground” role. Cryptoguard has started working on these new responsibilities\na while ago, hence why getting a new Community Manager that would be entirely\nfocused on the community was necessary.\n\nPaul Schmitzer Gets a New Role\nAs part of this reshuffling on the communications team, Paul Schmitzer will take\non a more strategic and partnership-focused role, assisting Imran in doing some\nof that. Paul’s new position will be mostly focused on contacting people, help\nto form new partnerships and relationships, and managing the communications\nstrategy on a higher level.\n\nLina Seiche Leaves the Project\nLina Seiche, former Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist for Particl,\nis unfortunately leaving the project in favor of a new job offer she’s received.\nWe would like to thank Lina for her work with Particl and wish her all the best\nwith her future endeavors!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is with great excitement that we step within this final pre-mainnet phase.\nWith a few years behind our backs, it is now time to let the world know about\nthe wonders of Particl and its Open Marketplace.\n\nSo get prepared, get your computers ready for testing, and let’s revolutionize\nthe world of eCommerce together!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update/1-kxHpRkWtmo3WsOgNQlqWUg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"toward-the-mainnet-release-of-the-particl-open-marketplace\">Toward the Mainnet Release of the Particl Open Marketplace</h3><p>The gears are turning, and ever since the Market Key Generation Contest was announced on the 26th of July, the process of bringing the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet is now well in motion!</p><p>This blog post is going to be an important one — it will give you all the information you need to know about what’s coming up as well as the remaining steps before the Open Marketplace moves onto mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-road-to-mainnet\">The Road to Mainnet</h2><p>It is finally here! <strong>The Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet on the 12th of August!</strong></p><p>Ever since the 16th of July, we have entered in the final mile of the marathon that is the mainnet launch of the Particl Open Marketplace.

It was also announced that anyone\ncould start generating market keys and any of them could be submitted on Github\nto enable market capabilities on the official Particl Desktop 2.0 build.\n\nSo let’s have some fun with it!\nTo celebrate this important milestone, as well as the upcoming Trezor hardware\ndevice support for PART [https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/316],\nthe Particl team will be giving away one (1) Trezor hardware device to 3 random\npeople who submit a set of market keys of their own. On top of this, the team\nwill also be giving away one (1) free limited edition t-shirt to every\nparticipant of this contest.\n\nLet’s first understand what this contest and giveaway are all about: the\ncreation and selection of market keys to be used as the default market on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * What are Market Keys?\n * Create a Set of Market Keys\n * Submit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Contest Prizes\n * Contest Rules\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Market Keys?\nTo understand market keys, we need to refer back to the difference between user\nmarkets and the main interface of the Open Marketplace.\n\nMarket Keys are similar to PART address keys. There is a private and public key\nthat identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets\nwithin Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and\nsell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl\nOpen Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable\nby all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these\nmarkets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell\nitems on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown\nto everyone without the private key.\n\nWhen installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the\nlistings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface\nof the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate\nlistings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user\nmarkets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.\n\nThese markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into\nyour local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the\nOpen Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase,\nor moderate any listing it contains.\n\nThere isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default\ninterface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can\nbe used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only\nperceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is\na market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to\nmanually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user\nmarkets need to be manually connected to.\n\n> The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user\nmarket. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the\nmain interface. —Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/]\nAs you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nrequires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default. And\nwhile no extra step is required by the user to connect to the main interface of\nthe marketplace, this “connection” still need to be made before a new version of\nthe Open Marketplace is pushed publicly.\n\n> Note: It is not required to generate a key to use the Particl Open Marketplace.\nWhen downloading and installing Particl Desktop 2.0 or higher, it will come\npre-packaged with a market key already linked to the client.\nAnd to do just that, an entity has to generate and choose what market keys will\nbe used to host the main market of the Open Marketplace. This is where the\ncommunity comes in…\n\nHow to Generate and Submit Market Keys\nWhile the Particl team is building the Open Marketplace protocol, it doesn’t own\nor has any sort of control over the network itself. It is entirely up to the\ncommunity of users to run and govern it. That also means generating and choosing\nwhat set of market keys is going to be used to display the main interface of the\nmarketplace will be a 100% community-led process.\n\n> Note: Generating a set of market keys does not give you any special access,\npermission, or power over the market.

There is a private and public key that identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets within Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and sell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl Open Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable by all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these markets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell items on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown to everyone without the private key.</p><p>When installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the listings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface of the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate listings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user markets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.</p><p>These markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into your local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the Open Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase, or moderate any listing it contains.</p><p>There isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default interface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can be used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only perceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is a market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to manually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user markets need to be manually connected to.</p><blockquote>The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user market. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the main interface. — <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/\">Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer</a></blockquote><p>As you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace requires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default.

only because it’s\nParticl’s second anniversary. No, there is indeed some very exciting news that\nis now ready to be shared. Are you ready to unwrap that intel gift?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Updates\nAll of the bugs that have been identified during the last testnet run (with\nblinded escrow) have been fixed. As it stands right now, we would feel 100%\nconfident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows. The\nproduct is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.\n\nAll there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT\nprotocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can\nbe completely untraceable.\n\nNew Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week\nAs you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been\nsuccessfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are\nnow available on mainnet.\n\nAnd because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first\nplace, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been\npretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to\ncomplete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two\nprotocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were\npublished on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the\nParticl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl\ndevelopers to bake in the integration into the back-end.\n\nThe team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to\nensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are\nestimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would\nbring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT)\nescrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard\ndeadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this\nmoment.\n\nThis build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week\nas well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will\nallow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it\nwill also allow you to earn a few PART!\n\nTwo Bug Bounties\nAt the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties\nwill officially start —one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a\npermanent, general bug bounty for mainnet.\n\nThe testnet bug bounty is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs\nthat remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which \nwill run for two weeks, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first\nmainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the\ncode is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is\nlikely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of\nthe bug bounty.\n\nThe second bounty, the permanent one, is a mainnet bounty that’s going to stay\nposted on Particl’s official website [http://particl.io]. This bounty is\ndedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and\nproperly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for\ntheir work and contribution. More information about the bounty will be given\nwhen it is published on particl.io [http://particl.io], which is going to be on\nthe same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.\n\nGenerating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)\nAs the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT\nescrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their\nvery own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just\nbelow.\n\nparticl/particl-market [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\nParticl Marketplace. Contribute to particl/particl-market development by\ncreating an account on GitHub. [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\n\n> Note: The Particl team has been building testnet and mainnet builds for\nconferences and community/internal testing using this repository, but they\nhaven’t been fully anon until after the hardfork.\nA market key, or Market ID, is a unique stream of characters and numbers which\ngives you access to a marketplace. These are, in reality, “private markets” that\nanyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the\nkey, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list\nitems, flag undesirable content, etc).\n\nBootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace\nGenerating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to\nlaunch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for\nanyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and\nhave it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the\nmarketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be\n100% community-powered.\n\nYou see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public\nmarket. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market\nwhich has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any\nprivate market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity\nthat you will have as a community member.\n\nDon’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market\nkey as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market\nkey’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the\nmarketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.\n\nFor the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out\nhow to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the\nREADME.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to\ndo it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so\nthat more people can join the fun.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019\nOn the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant\nbug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl\nDesktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone\nfor the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets,\ncommunity proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever\nsince, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace,\non mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.\n\nWhat is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means,\nbut rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.\n\nWith the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized,\nand permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike\nwill use the available features.\n\nSo get ready! The months of July and August will be ones to remember for a very\nlong time!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-3aInZ5BQOBAdR3s0ESIbig.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"let-s-celebrate-\">Let’s celebrate! ??</h3><p>Today is Particl’s second anniversary, and there are plenty of good reasons to take a moment and celebrate.</p><p>This blog post is definitely a celebratory one.

No, <strong>there is indeed some very exciting news that is now ready to be shared</strong>. Are you ready to unwrap that intel gift?</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-open-marketplace-updates\">Particl Open Marketplace Updates</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-S_fPVIak-t6K7ukw7LoCDA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All of the bugs that have been identified during the last testnet run (with blinded escrow) have been fixed. As it stands right now, <strong>we would feel 100% confident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows</strong>. The product is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.</p><p>All there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT protocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can be completely untraceable.</p><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-testnet-build-releases-next-week\">New Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week</h3><p>As you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been successfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are now available on mainnet.</p><p>And because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first place, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been pretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to complete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two protocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were published on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the Particl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl developers to bake in the integration into the back-end.</p><p>The team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to ensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are estimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would bring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT) escrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard deadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this moment.</p><p>This build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week as well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will allow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it will also allow you to earn a few PART!</p><h3 id=\"two-bug-bounties\">Two Bug Bounties</h3><p>At the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties will officially start — <strong>one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a permanent, general bug bounty for mainnet</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>testnet bug bounty</strong> is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs that remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which <strong>will run for two weeks</strong>, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first mainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the code is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is likely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of the bug bounty.</p><p>The second bounty, the permanent one, is a <strong>mainnet bounty</strong> that’s going to stay posted on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">Particl’s official website</a>. This bounty is dedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and properly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for their work and contribution. More information about the bounty will be given when it is published on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">particl.io</a>, which is going to be on the same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.</p><h3 id=\"generating-market-keys-advanced-users-can-start-today-\">Generating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)</h3><p>As the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT escrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their very own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just below.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><strong>particl/particl-market</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><em>Particl Marketplace. Contribute to particl/particl-market development by creating an account on GitHub.</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">github.com</a></p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The Particl team has been building testnet and mainnet builds for conferences and community/internal testing using this repository, but they haven’t been fully anon until after the hardfork.</blockquote><p>A market key, or Market ID, is a unique stream of characters and numbers which gives you access to a marketplace. These are, in reality, “private markets” that anyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the key, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list items, flag undesirable content, etc).</p><h3 id=\"bootstrapping-the-public-interface-of-the-open-marketplace\">Bootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace</h3><p>Generating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to launch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for anyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and have it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the marketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be 100% community-powered.</p><p>You see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public market. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market which has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any private market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity that you will have as a community member.</p><p>Don’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market key as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market key’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the marketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.</p><p>For the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out how to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the README.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to do it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so that more people can join the fun.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-2-0-releases-on-august-12-2019\">Particl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019</h2><p>On the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant bug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.</p><p>Particl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone for the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets, community proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever since, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet.</p><hr><p>This is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.</p><p>What is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means, but rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.</p><p>With the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized, and permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike will use the available features.</p><p><strong>So get ready! The months of July and August will be ones to remember for a very long time!</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-fJlNhXY7IcQiUzAyqmbTGA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-3aInZ5BQOBAdR3s0ESIbig.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"let-s-celebrate-"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let’s celebrate! ??"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Today is Particl’s second anniversary, and there are plenty of good reasons to take a moment and celebrate."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This blog post is definitely a celebratory one.

In short, \nhold funds in Anon balances and make RingCT transactions every once in a while.\n\nRingCT is a privacy protocol that becomes increasingly effective as more and\nmore people use it. This is one of the main reasons why the Particl Open\nMarketplace will make all transaction private by default using the protocol\n(more marketplace users automatically means a stronger privacy).\n\nTo help the network and support its privacy, it is recommended to leave a\nportion of your coins in Anon balances. This helps the network by providing more\noutputs that can be used by other users within their ring groups. In other\nwords, the more coins being held in Anon balances, the more outputs can be used\nby everyone else as decoys for their transactions.\n\nRingCT also gets even stronger when you make a few transactions here and there.\nThat’s because the protocol tends to prioritize recent outputs in order to \nmitigate the traceability of coins [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/].\n\nAdditionally, if you want to anonymize the coins you currently hold properly, it\nis recommended that you do multiple RingCT transactions (Anon balances to Anon \nbalances) to yourself before transferring coins held in your Anon balance back\nto your Public balance. That’s because an observer can tell the maximum size of\na recently created anon output by looking at the amounts of the non-blinded\ninputs that went into it. Alternatively, you can also wait some time after your \nPublic to Anon balance transfer so that your RingCT outputs can be used by\nvarious ring groups. That will add more possibilities, making the real origin\nmore difficult to trace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll Set for the Open Marketplace Mainnet Launch\nThe RingCT and Bulletproofs hardfork is an important step leading up to the\nrelease of the Particl Open Marketplace. As the marketplace decentralized\napplication works exclusively using Anon balances, meaning that you can only\npurchase and sell items using RingCT transactions, now is the time to start\nconverting some of your coins into Anon balances and get ready for the launch!\n\nNot only will you help the network and its privacy level, but you’ll also be\nfully ready to use the Particl Open Marketplace as soon as it comes out!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/RingCT---Bulletproofs-Now-Available-on-Mainnet/1-a6cQyigLiIO9mv6qG4r8tQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It’s official!

These articles should give you a good base knowledge\nof the more technical features of the platform and can serve as pointers when\nexplaining a feature to a new community member or user of the platform.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency with varying levels of anonymity. In\nfact, using two different privacy protocols, users of the PART coin can choose\nbetween 3 types of transactions (public, blinded, anonymous) when making\npayments to other people or to addresses they own. Each of these transaction\ntypes carries its own level of privacy as well as its own set of properties.\n\nThis article will break down each of these transaction types and go into more\ndetails about them, explaining why and when you should use them. Privacy\ntransactions on Particl should have no secret for you anymore after reading\nthis!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * Public Transactions\n * Blinded Transactions (CT)\n * Rangeproofs\n * Bulletproofs\n * Anonymous Transactions  (RingCT)\n * Ring Signatures (MLSAG)\n * How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\n * Keeping a Good Level of Privacy\n * Stealth Addresses\n * CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublic Transactions\n * Privacy level: Low\n * Transaction cost: Low (~0.000346 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transactions weight by ~20%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n\n(Fee: 0.000346 PART)By default, when not manually selecting any privacy protocol\nto obfuscate your transactions on the blockchain, transactions are sent out as\n“public transactions”. And because Particl is based on the Bitcoin codebase,\nthey are recorded on the blockchain the same way you would expect Bitcoin\ntransactions to be recorded.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, it is\nquite the contrary. Bitcoin transactions (and Particl transactions, by proxy)\nare what we call pseudonymous transactions and they are pretty transparent.\nInstead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead\ntied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and\ncharacters.\n\nWhile that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties,\nthe advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too\neasy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain\nand tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a\npayment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment\nprocessors, vendors, etc.).\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy\nprotocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of\nthese protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators,\nbut also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as\ndifferent levels of privacy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)\nConfidential Transactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\nElements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.\nelementsproject.org\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\n\n * Privacy level: Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium (~0.001962 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n * Whitepaper: \n   https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n\n(Fee: 0.001962 PART)Blinded transactions are currency transactions that have their transacting\namounts hidden on the blockchain and only known by the two transacting parties\n(the sender and the receiver). This type of transaction uses the Confidential\nTransactions (CT)\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation] \nprivacy protocol which cryptographically guarantees that no more coins can be\nspent than are available. It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that does not\nrequire any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party.\n\nSending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl DesktopThis privacy protocol is\nentirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any trusted setup\n[https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/] and doesn’t require the assistance\nof any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols\nrequiring so-called “trusted setups [https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/]\n” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of \nmaster keys. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to\ndestroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those\nkeys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without\nanyone noticing it.\n\nTo prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the\ncorrect ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a rangeproof. In other\nwords, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a\ngiven transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what\nthat amount is.\n\nRangeproofs\nA rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to verify that a payment amount is\npositive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the\ntransaction. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so\nlarge that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be\ngenerated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and\nanother different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make\nthe commitments still sum to zero.\n\nThe downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain.\nTheir size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the\nbits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, rangeproofs take\nup the majority of a blinded transaction’s size.\n\nThis inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have\nto execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction\nnot only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain\ngrows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient\nto run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.\n\nThis scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has\nrefrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because\nthis project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a\nproper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came\nBulletproofs.\n\nBulletproofs\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nBulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically\nrather than linearly. In its whitepaper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf],\nthey are referred to as non-interactive zero-knowledge short proofs. In simple\nterms, Bulletproofs is a groundbreaking improvement over regular rangeproofs as \nthey reduce their size by around ~70%. And, because rangeproofs make up for the\nmajority of a CT transaction size, it in turn reduces transaction fees and the\nspace they take on the blockchain by the same ratio.\n\n> Fun fact: The term “Bulletproofs” was coined by Shashank Agrawal when he\ndescribed the new type of rangeproof as “short like a bullet, with bulletproof\nsecurity assumption”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnonymous Transactions — RingCT\n * Privacy level: High (Transacting amounts and participants are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium to high, depending on the number of mixins used in\n   the ring signatures or the size of the rings\n * Transaction cost for low privacy setting: ~0.003232 PART\n * Transaction cost for high privacy setting: ~0.009032 PART\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transaction weight by ~47%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces rangeproofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: No\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n\n(Fee: 0.005708 PART for 8 ring members and 2 inputs)Anonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl Desktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not only hiding the transacting amounts but\nalso the identity of the transacting parties (the sender and the receiver). This\ntype of transaction uses the RingCT privacy protocol, a protocol made popular by\nMonero but adapted to work with the Bitcoin codebase by the Particl team. This\nallows the platform to benefit from the industry-leading privacy protocol that\nis RingCT but still leverage the security, stability, and developer community of\nBitcoin. In other words, RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase is like having your cake\nand eating it too. The good, without the bad.\n\nSending an anon transaction (RingCT) with 22 ring members on Particl DesktopGood\nexamples of this include RingCT being able to be used, with the help of special\nscripts, on atomic swaps, decentralized applications (i.e. Particl’s Open\nMarketplace), the Lightning Network, and etc. It also enables RingCT to be\ndirectly linked to CT transactions so that it can reach full programmability, as\nwe’ll see later in this article.\n\nJust like blinded transactions, which use the CT protocol, anonymous\ntransactions are entirely trustless and don’t rely on any sort of trusted setup.\nIt’s important to note that RingCT transactions are also a bit bigger than\nConfidential Transactions, although not by a big margin. This is due to the\naddition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.\n\n> Fun fact: RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase\n(Monero). The Particl team is the first team to ever develop a custom\nimplementation that could work on any other codebase, in this case, the Bitcoin\ncodebase.\nRing Signatures (MLSAG)\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of MLSAG: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nMultilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures (MLSAG), or ring\nsignatures, is the Ring part of RingCT. It is a type of digital signature that\nis performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs \n(represented by Anon balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then impossible for\nany observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is\nthe output actually sending out the transaction.\n\nWikipedia describes ring signatures as follow\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature]: “A ring signature is a type of \ndigital signature [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature] that can be\nperformed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a\nmessage signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular\ngroup of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it\nshould be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’\nkeys was used to produce the signature.”.\n\nIn RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have\noriginated from any member of the ring group. Users put some of their funds\nwithin an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute\nRingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously\nsigns it by using other RingCT outputs as decoys and produces a signature that,\nwhen verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of\nthe RingCT outputs used by the ring group. It is not possible to know who really\nmade the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being\nused by the ring group as a decoy.\n\nThis effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction— the\namount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It\nalso arms transacting parties with a very strong plausible deniability (1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability], 2\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption]).\n\nHow to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\nA RingCT transaction containing 24 ring membersOn Particl Desktop, it is\npossible to pick the number of members you want to have within the ring group \nyou’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is\nreferred to as NO. OF RING SIGS.\n\nWhat it means is simple, for every input used to generate your transaction, a\nnumber of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could\nhave been signed by any of the 24 participants. In the screenshot just above,\nthe value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender\nof the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1\ninput). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each\ninput, with 3 different ring groups of 24 participants each, will be generated\nin order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t\nworry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as\neasy to send as any other type of transaction.\n\nTo make a RingCT transaction, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the\nAnontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO.\nOF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The\nvalue you pick will be equal to the number of ring members that will be part of\nyour ring group. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the\ndefault level of privacy (8 ring members). This represents a good balance\nbetween privacy and cost.\n\n> Note: The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more\nexpensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members\n(RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it\ngets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a\ntransaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring\nmembers as possible and with as many inputs as possible.\nKeeping a Good Level of Privacy\nAs a general rule of thumb and in theory, RingCT gets more private as more\npeople convert their public balances into Anon balances, thus creating more Anon \noutputs to be used by ring groups for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT\nrelies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed\na transaction, and the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the\nstronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets.\n\nBut, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain,\nthey’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason\nthe protocol behaves this way is in response to this research paper\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/] which demonstrates that real inputs can be\nguessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the\nchain and haven’t had transactions for a while.\n\nFor this reason, it is recommended that all users keep with them an Anon balance \nwhich can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of\ncourse). Additionally, it is also recommended that users transact as much as\npossible with Anon transactions so that it can contribute to enhancing the\nentire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute\na RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient\nit becomes for everyone.\n\nThis is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to\nuse RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best\nway to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual\nusage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s\nmain application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s\nRingCT protocol a very solid one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStealth Addresses\nAdditionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular,\npublic addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy\nbecause only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it\nor not. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can\nreceive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time\naddress’ for that output/transaction.\n\nWithout knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link\nand guess which outputs match which stealth address. This helps in protecting\nthe identity of the receiver of a transaction.\n\nOn their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions\ninformation from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but\nwhen combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides\nyet another layer of privacy for the user.\n\nAs it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be\nexecuted to stealth addresses.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\nBoth privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable\ndifferences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has\nprogrammable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as\nis, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that does not mean,\nhowever, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is\nthat possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? This is one of the\nbig reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network\ninstead of just one of them.\n\nIn fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in\nsmart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of\nParticl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for\nanything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.\n\nThe best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace.\nIt is a private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize\nmarketplace transactions. What few people know is that the marketplace actually\nuses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for\nits escrow system, not RingCT.\n\nThat’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract\nfunctionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence\nwhy it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to\nsend a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically\nconverts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets\nreleased by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a\nRingCT transaction.\n\n> A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of\nthe escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it\nwill directly be released to a RingCT output.— Kewde [https://github.com/kewde/]\n, Particl Developer and OMP Library\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/]Author\nThis is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and\nleverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same\nsort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or\nservices such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized\napplications, and etc.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more \nParticl Explained articles will be posted on particl.news [http://particl.news] \nin the future.\n\nThe Particl team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It is a <strong>type of digital signature that is performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs</strong> (represented by <em>Anon</em> balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

And because Particl is based on the Bitcoin codebase, they are recorded on the blockchain the same way you would expect Bitcoin transactions to be recorded.</p><p><strong>Contrary to what a lot of people claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous</strong>. In fact, it is quite the contrary. Bitcoin transactions (and Particl transactions, by proxy) are what we call <strong>pseudonymous</strong> transactions and they are pretty transparent. Instead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead tied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and characters.</p><p>While that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties, the advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too easy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain and tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a payment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment processors, vendors, etc.).</p><p>For this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy protocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of these protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators, but also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as different levels of privacy.</p><hr><h2 id=\"blinded-transactions-confidential-transactions-ct-\">Blinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)</h2><p><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><strong>Confidential Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><em>Elements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.</em>elementsproject.org</a></p><ul><li><em>Privacy level: <strong>Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost: <strong>Medium (~0.001962 PART)</strong></em></li><li><em>Segwit: <strong>Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Bulletproofs: <strong>Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Trusted setup: <strong>No</strong></em></li><li><em>Programmable outputs: <strong>Yes</strong></em></li><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><em><strong>https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>(Fee: 0.001962 PART)</figcaption></figure><p>Blinded transactions are <strong>currency transactions that have their transacting amounts hidden on the blockchain</strong> and only known by the two transacting parties (the sender and the receiver).

It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that <strong>does not require any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-q2ZhXl4uqiCXm9IfbIAQuA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Sending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>This privacy protocol is entirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any <a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setup</strong></a> and doesn’t require the assistance of any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols requiring so-called “<a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setups</strong></a>” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of <em>master keys</em>. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to destroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those keys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without anyone noticing it.</p><p>To prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the correct ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a <strong>rangeproof. </strong>In other words, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a given transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what that amount is.</p><h3 id=\"rangeproofs\">Rangeproofs</h3><p>A rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to<strong> verify that a payment amount is positive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the transaction</strong>. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so large that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be generated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and another different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make the commitments still sum to zero.</p><p>The downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain. Their size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the bits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, <strong>rangeproofs take up the majority of a blinded transaction’s size</strong>.</p><p>This inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have to execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction not only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain grows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient to run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.</p><p>This scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has refrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because this project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a proper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came Bulletproofs.</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs\">Bulletproofs</h3><ul><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><strong>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</strong></em></a></li><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>Bulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically rather than linearly.

It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

But, for those readers curious about the\nimpact these will have in the privacy-focused, decentralized economy Particl is\nbuilding, this post will help explain a bit more.\n\nThe Most Important PART\n? This is a full hardfork.\nAfter July 16th, no nodes below 0.18.0.10 should be on the main chain. That\nmeans everyone will need to update to Particl Core v0.18.0.10 (or newer) before\n2019–07–16.

Testnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.01–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nSMSG variable difficulty gives the network a way to disable free smsg messages\nif someone starts spamming. By design, each free smsg has to hash in a certain\nway (like PoW). This makes the difficulty variable as opposed to hard-coded.\n\n? Mainnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.16–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable bulletproof rangeproofs.\n * Enable RingCT transactions.\n * Enable variable fee rate for smsg paid messages.\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nBulletproof rangeproofs are a much more efficient rangeproof than what has been\non the network to date. When we launched Particl with Confidential Transactions\n(CT) in 2017 a major difficulty was the size of blind transactions compared to \npublic transactions. CT transactions typically are 20x larger than non-CT\ntransactions. Bulletproofs can allow doubling the range size while still\nreducing transactions sizes by 65% or more.\n\n> Bulletproofs are much more general than rangeproofs. They can be used to prove,\nin zero knowledge, arbitrary statements. They are equivalent in power to SNARKs\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/507] or STARKs [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046],\nbut have native support for elliptic curve (EC) public keys and Pedersen\ncommitments (so there is typically no need to implement EC math inside a program\nbeing proven). Also, unlike SNARKs, Bulletproofs have full 128-bit security\nunder standard assumptions with no trusted setup. Unlike STARKs, they are fast\nenough to prove and verify reasonably-sized problems on typical computing\nhardware. —Andrew Poelstra\n[https://blockstream.com/2018/02/21/en-bulletproofs-faster-rangeproofs-and-much-more/]\nRingCT transactions are unlinkable and untraceable onchain transactions. RingCT\nis short for Ring Confidential Transactions. First described\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] by Shen Noether of XMR Labs, Particl’s\nversion is a complete ground-up build on the current Bitcoin codebase (0.18) by\nour very talented Lead Core developer Tecnovert.\n\n> For the record, this whole development update is directly tied to the phenomenal\nwork Tecnovert builds into Particl Core. Give him a big “Thank You!” next time\nyou stop in our Discord [https://discord.me/particl] | Open Development Channel.\nThe announcement of RingCT coming to the main chain is huge news for a number of\nyou waiting for fully anonymous PART transactions. Tecnovert first released\nRingCT onto the test chain in the middle of 2017 and we have had a number of\nrespected researchers, educators and code auditors review it over the last 2\nyears.\n\nThe last security audit preformed by Quarkslab has been sent to the team and\nreviewed. We will have more news about it when they publish the public audit. We\nchose to engage Quarkslab on our MLSAG/bulletproof algorithms because of their\nprevious work with identifying 4 major/3 minor vulnerabilities in Monero’s\nbulletproof security audit\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-audit-of-monero-bulletproofs.html].\n\nCold Staking Pool Operators\nTecnovert has raised the daemon version for the coldstakingpool code to\n0.18.0.10.\n\nA new version page is available here: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.txt\n\nDon’t Forget!\n?

With this, the Awareness Campaign is now resumed\n[https://friends.particl.community], with sign up payouts disabled, so that you\ncan continue earning staking shares by referring your friends to Particl. When\nyou reach 12 points, you will earn your first staking share. Each additional\npoint will reward you with a staking share.\n\nFor more details, read our latest blog post on the Awareness Campaign by\nfollowing this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-awareness-campaign-update-d94347324121\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe announced a few days before the NYC Blockchain Week that we were launching an\nawareness campaign to get more people to know about Particl. While we expected\nthe campaign to reach a few hundred people, it blew up and went viral overnight,\nreaching the hidden payouts cap that had been set up for the campaign in just a\nfew hours.\n\nWith the first payouts being initially scheduled for today, we’d like to thank\neverybody that has participated in the campaign so for and keep you updated on\nthe status of the campaign and let you know what comes next!\n\nThe Campaign Goes Viral\nThis awareness campaign was initially designed to be a grassroots initiative to\nget friends to know about Particl and its Open Marketplace. Little did we know,\nthe campaign became viral in a matter of mere hours and was shared within many\nmassive airdrop and signup groups, creating a rapid influx of participants\novernight.\n\nAwareness Campaign Stats\n * Number of registered participants: 16,944\n * Number of participants automatically detected as fraudulent: 6,657\n * Number of Particl Desktop downloads during campaign: ~2,000\n * Hidden payouts cap reached after: ~16 hours\n * Number of participants that qualify for staking shares: 105\n\nCircumventing Fraud\nBecause we did not expect this campaign to get as viral as it did, and so\nrapidly, we’ve been surprised by the huge amount of fraudulent participation\nwe’ve received. Luckily, the platform we’re using to run the campaign was set up\nto automatically flag fraudulent emails based on various criteria. In total, the\nsystem flagged 6,657 fake emails based on a wide variety of criteria, excluding\nthese participants from the campaign.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve been running our own script to find any other fraudulent\nemail that would bypass the platform’s filter. In the end, it turns out that \nonly ~1,800 participants have properly followed all the steps required by the\ncampaign, a figure that matches closely the approximate number of unique Particl\nDesktop downloads.\n\nCampaign Status\nThe fraud attempts have required more time to sort out than expected. We also\nwanted to take off as many fake participants as possible in order to keep the\ncontest fair for the honest participants.\n\nTo make that process easier, we temporarily paused the campaign until we could\nbuild scripts that would be able to automatically filter large amounts of emails\nand private addresses and get them sorted on a database so that we could process\npayouts more effectively.\n\nAs such, we still need a bit of time before processing payment, a process that\nwill probably extend over the next few days.\n\nWhen Will I Receive my Payout?\nIf you qualify for the signup payouts, don’t worry, it is normal that you\nhaven’t received anything yet. You should be receiving your payment within the\nnext few hours/days. You won’t need to do anything special to claim your PART,\nit will simply eventually show up on your Overview page as an incoming\ntransaction!\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for payouts:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Complete the steps above before the hidden payout cap is reached (within the\n   first 16 hours of the campaign)\n\nIf you also qualify for staking shares, meaning that you at least got 10 of your\nfriends to sign up with Particl, you should also receive your first payment\nshortly.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for staking shares:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Get more than 10 friends to sign up with Particl\n\nWhat We’ve Learned From this Campaign\nThis campaign has had good results — Particl Desktop has been downloaded around\n2,000 times during this campaign. After all, the goal was to get users playing\naround with crypto’s best-looking wallet!\n\nBut it is also very clear that the system has been abused to a bigger extent\nthan we expected it to be. Nearly 17,000 people participated, but there were\nonly around 2,000 unique downloads of Particl Desktop and around 1,800\nparticipants that went through the campaign’s steps properly. That means that,\nright out of the bat, around 15,000 (~88%) participants haven’t properly gone\nthrough the process of qualifying for payouts.\n\nThis has been a good experiment that has brought valuable insight as to how to\nimprove future awareness campaigns and how to sustain larger degrees of\nparticipation. We look forward to initiating similar campaigns in the future by\nusing the goods, without the bads, of this awareness campaign.\n\nWhat Now?\nOnce the first payouts will be paid, we will resume the Awareness Campaign as\nplanned. Remember, now that the hidden payouts cap has been reached after only\n16 hours into the campaign, the only reward for signing up with Particl will be\nthe staking shares earned once you get more than 10 of your friends to sign up\nas well.\n\nKeep your eyes close to your Particl Desktop wallet. Once you receive your\npayment, the Awareness Campaign will resume and you’ll be able to start earning\npoints again by getting your friends to sign up on \nhttps://friends.particl.community/.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe would like to thank everyone that has participated in the campaign so far and\nwish you the best luck in your hunt for staking shares!\n\nIf you have any question regarding the Awareness Campaign, join our Particl\nAwareness Telegram channel by following this link: https://t.me/particlawareness\n.\n\nTo read the announcement post for the campaign, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/announcement-particl-awareness-campaign-464baa8477b5\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Awareness-Campaign-Update/1-0aizM4VoRA47jkDdp0fdDA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><hr><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The sign up payouts for the Awareness Campaign have been executed earlier today.

simply\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * NYC Blockchain Week Recap\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-2-f4ca972abed0]\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Mainnet Release Timeline\nSince Particl has updated its core to 0.18 just 13 days ago\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7], we would like\nto let you know exactly where we currently stand, what’s the current projected\nmainnet release timeline, and what to look out for in the next few days!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Marketplace Mainnet Release Roadmap\n * (1) Finish blind escrow integration (Done)\n * (2) Finish the OMP Library integration tests (In progress)\n * (3) Tweak Particl Desktop to integrate the OMP Library (Pending) -> ETA: 1–2\n   days\n * (4) Publish final testnet build to the community before mainnet release \n   (Pending) -> ETA: Approximately 1 week if all goes smoothly\n * (5) Mainnet release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinish the Blind Escrow Integration (Done)\nDuring the last few weeks, the team had the opportunity to integrate the blind\nescrow in full and make a series of critical tweaks to the OMP Library just\nbefore releasing the marketplace on mainnet. The OMP Library was written some\ntime ago by Particl’s developer Kewde, but the team wanted to make some\nmodifications to it and run proper testing, specifically related to the buy\nflow, before putting it onto mainnet.\n\nThe OMP Library is a major improvement to the backend of the Particl Open\nMarketplace, allowing for example escrows to process transactions automatically\nusing Confidential Transactions or for listings to have more attributes.\n\nWe are happy to say that the integration of the blind escrow system into the\nmarketplace is now complete.\n\nFinish the OMP Library Integration Tests (In Progress)\nThe next step is to finalize the OMP Library integration by running the whole\nsuite of automated tests the team has built over the last two years. These\nautomated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break\nthem in any possible way.\n\nWhen a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be\nupdated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until\nit finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results,\nwe would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until\nafter these tests are complete.\n\nWe initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC\nBlockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the\nconferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead\nMarketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open\nMarketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason\nwhy we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it\nback home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the\nfinal testnet build before the first mainnet release.\n\nNote that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To\nthe contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a\nmajority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a\nclear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We\nactually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will\ncommunicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.\n\nWhy are These Tests so Important?\nThese automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes\nParticl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put\nout in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it\nis as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.\n\nThe tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components.\nIn fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved\nonto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there\nwill always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a\nhuge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the\nsecurity of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while\nit’s on the track racing.\n\nTake the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the\nseller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds\nlocked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that\ncould potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can\nimagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet\nenvironment!\n\n> Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track\nracing. — Joe Fisher\nThat doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after\nit launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time\nconsuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and\nare fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of\ntesting before unleashing on mainnet.\n\nThis is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet\nrelease.\n\nIntegrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)\nOnce the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate\nthe last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick\nto complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the\nbackend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works\nflawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the\nintegration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to\nParticl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy\nflow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.\n\nLast Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)\nAs soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the\ncommunity, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release\nof the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nBecause the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few\nmonths, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the\nimportant thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as\nthey will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being\nreleased on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.\n\nNevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet\nclient before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be\nrunning a short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500\nworth of PART to the best bug hunters out there! We will reveal all of the\ndetails once we publish the testnet build.\n\nWe estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a\nduration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard\ndate, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major\nissue arises.\n\nThen, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live\non mainnet will be upon us!\n\nMainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\nThis is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open\nMarketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto\nmainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with\nreal funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet\nrun of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.\n\nSo When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?\nAt this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that\nthe tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed\nwithin a pretty short time frame of a few days, though. Then, once it’s done, 1\nto 2 days will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last\ntestnet will be released to the public for a period of approximately 1 week, if\nall goes smoothly. We definitely want and will communicate a more precise\ntimeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library\nintegration tests. However, this development update should still be able to give\nyou a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.\n\nIn the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at\nthe Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to maximize the exposure of\nthe mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in\nlight of the new contacts we’ve made.\n\nAfter nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there! All\nfeatures intended to be part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nhave been integrated and are going through their final automated testing rounds.\nAlthough we are not able to give a definitive date for the mainnet release\ntoday, we will be communicating one very shortly.\n\nHang tight because from here on out, things will get very interesting!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews Flash: Particl Bulletproofs Audit by Quarkslab\nOn a non-marketplace related note, we are pleased to announce that Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] has started auditing our Bitcoin-based\nBulletproofs integration. Quarkslab is a world-renowned security firm having\naudited codes and projects like OpenSSL\n[https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/], \nVeraCrypt\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/veracrypt-audit-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities,32878.html]\n, OpenVPN [https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-assessment-of-openvpn.html], and,\ninterestingly enough, Monero’s Bulletproofs implementation\n[https://blokt.com/news/monero-fixes-all-bulletproof-protocol-vulnerabilities-found-in-second-security-audit]\n.\n\nOnce the audit is done, we’ll look into the report, address any potential issue\nit identifies, and start planning ahead for a hardfork of Particl’s RingCT with\nBulletproofs on mainnet.\n\nWe will keep you informed as details come in!\n\nWelcome — Quarkslab [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\nEvery security issue is different, every solution must be\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]www.quarkslab.com [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming up?\nWith all the intended features for the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nbeing integrated, part of the development team has now started working on the\nnext features that will be integrated into the marketplace. Note that none of\nthese new features will be included in the first mainnet version of the Open\nMarketplace. As the build is pretty stable right now, we do not want to\nintegrate new functions that could delay the mainnet release.\n\nQuantity Management\nA must-have for vendors running a business out of their sales. Quantity\nManagement is like a lite version of the full Inventory Management system we\nplan on integrating later during the Beta phase of development. It allows\nvendors to set quantities for their listings and lets people bid multiple times\non the same listings if the vendors set their quantity accordingly.\n\nFuture Features\nThe Particl team also has other features it would like to focus on first after\nthe mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. We still want to go through a few\nother development meeting sessions before communicating what other features\nother than Quantity Management will be worked on first. We will let you know all\nof the information after the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the Development Update part of this Community Update.

This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason why we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it back home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release.</p><p>Note that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process.

Every feature we put out in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it is as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.</p><p>The tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components. In fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved onto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the marketplace.</p><p>In fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there will always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a huge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the security of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while it’s on the track racing.</p><p>Take the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the seller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds locked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that could potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can imagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet environment!</p><blockquote>Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track racing. — Joe Fisher</blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after it launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time consuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and are fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of testing before unleashing on mainnet.</p><p>This is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet release.</p><h3 id=\"integrate-the-omp-library-into-particl-desktop-pending-\">Integrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)</h3><p>Once the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate the last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick to complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the backend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works flawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the integration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to Particl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy flow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.</p><h3 id=\"last-testnet-build-before-mainnet-pending-\">Last Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)</h3><p>As soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the community, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace!</p><p>Because the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few months, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the important thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as they will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being released on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.</p><p>Nevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet client before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be running a <strong>short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500 worth of PART to the best bug hunters out there</strong>! We will reveal all of the details once we publish the testnet build.</p><p>We estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a duration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard date, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major issue arises.</p><p>Then, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live on mainnet will be upon us!</p><h3 id=\"mainnet-release-of-the-open-marketplace-pending-\">Mainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)</h3><p>This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto mainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with real funds.

Week\nLast week, the Particl team met in New York City to participate in the NYC\nBlockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events] by\nhaving a booth at both the Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus. There, the\nteam demonstrated the long-awaited Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet, for the\nfirst time ever and was able to make a huge leap forward by connecting directly\nwith the crypto community.\n\nToward the Particl Open Marketplace\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nThe coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one. Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for…\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\n\nIf you would like to read about Part 1 and Part 3 of this Community Update, then\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * Development Update\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-3-4d53bcf621af]\n\nMagical Crypto Conference\nThe team’s first stop was at the Magical Crypto Conference\n[https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/], an event organized by the “magical\nfriends” — Charlie Lee, Samson Mow, Ricardo Spagni, and WhalePanda. In\ncomparison to Consensus, MCC aims to be the go-to conference for the true crypto\nfans and cypherpunks. It is an environment that is safe from all the corporate\ninfluence of Consensus and focuses on the tech moving forward. And magical it\nwas…\n\nDay 1 of MCC was Particl’s cupcake day. In fact, Particl saw its first\nsuccessful marketplace transaction take place on mainnet\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1127237342920675328]! This is an enormous\nmilestone for the project and it really started the week on the right foot,\nespecially as the whole process happened very smoothly and without any hiccup.\n\nBecause this event was mostly attended by long-time Bitcoin fans and people who\ngenerally don’t like the whole corporate/altcoin aspect of Consensus, we\nexpected to be met with skepticism and be put on the spot. However, we were\npleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl\nOpen Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the\nbooth.\n\nMax Keiser at the Particl boothUsually, most people don’t like when a platform\nis exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has\nproven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its\nnative coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain\nprivate, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to.\nThe ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform\nintended to be used by all crypto users.\n\nOne of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest\nfrom the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all,\nthe first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto\nusers, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.\n\nWe can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors,\ndevelopers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore\ncrypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable\nfeedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to\nshowcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical\nCrypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure\nand is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!\n\nConsensus\nWhereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know\nabout the Open Marketplace, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] meant business!\n\nAs you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty\nexpensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping\n$1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people,\nmaking the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This\nactually turned out to be a good thing.\n\nLike many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the\nprevious edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing\naround for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a\nsour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical\nCrypto Conference was created in the first place.\n\nSmaller but Better Crowd\nThis year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The\nquality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts\nand figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto\nfans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives,\nmany team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all\nresulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain\nsolutions could disrupt their respective industries.\n\nAnd as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team.\nIt has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major\nvendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a\ntrustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact,\nwe have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of\nParticl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their\nbusinesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with\nthem.\n\nDisrupting of Supply Chains\nParticl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers\nand vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what\nsome of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that\nthe Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow\nsystem, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how\nsupply chains operate in a major way.\n\nThe Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by\ngetting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely\nmoving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various\napplications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply\nchains, hiding R&D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading\ngoods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.\n\nFrom all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed\nto be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the\nOpen Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely\navoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely\ngroundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.\n\nSeeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one\nof the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.\n\nGreat Connections\nAside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve\nhad quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the\nspace, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it\nless chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.\n\nWe are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and\nwe’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors\nthat have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.\n\nInsights Right From the Trenches\nNot only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those\ndiscussions have also been extremely insightful to the team. The fact that so\nmany people came with so many different backgrounds and areas of expertise, it\ngave us a lot of different perspectives and ways to see how Particl’s Open\nMarketplace could be used in real-life situations. Suffice to say, the potential\nof this marketplace extends much further than just being a cool marketplace for\ncrypto users.\n\nNYC Blockchain Week Recap\nThe NYC Blockchain Week may very well turn out to be a very impactful event for\nParticl. The Particl team is coming back home with a strong sense of mission\naccomplished. We’ve had the opportunity to meet with so many of the users we’re\nbuilding this platform for, collect a vast amount of feedback from them and get\ndecent exposure in the heart of crypto.\n\nThe whole team that attended the conferences feels like this entire week has\nbeen a solid validation of what we’ve known all along — Particl is a highly\ndisruptive marketplace that looks and feels right. The only difference now is\nthat we’ve met some of the very people that need this marketplace the most, and\nwe are all as motivated and optimistic about the future of this project as we’ve\never been!\n\nA Rare Working Blockchain Product\nOnce again, just like the few recent conferences we’ve attended, Particl seemed\nto be among the minority of booths with a working product on display. This was\nsomething that impressed a lot of people.\n\nSometimes, the booth would be so busy that you would need to explain Particl a\nbit further away from the computers. Then, when the person would ask for a video\ndemo, they’d be completely surprised to learn that we actually had a working\nversion of it on mainnet just a few meters away. This was a reaction we’ve seen\ntime and time again, people are still not used to the fact that a blockchain\nproduct could be live on mainnet, and look so damn good.\n\nBest Testing Ground\nOne very interesting aspect of our week in NYC was the fact that for the entire\nduration of the two conferences we’ve attended, the Particl Open Marketplace has\nbeen thoroughly tested on mainnet and under many different circumstances. We\nhave observed no issue whatsoever, and we feel very confident moving forward\nwith this product.\n\nWhat Now?\nWe want to continue traveling the world and keep reaching out to more people.\nWe’ve also made great friendships and connections with people in the space with\nwhom we want to keep spending time with. This is the reason why we’ll actively\nbe looking around at other conferences and keep an eye out for any interesting\nevent.\n\nAs such, we likely will have a few team members going to San Francisco on the\n25th and 26th of June for the Bitcoin2019 conference\n[https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/]. We will announce more details shortly,\nbut if you are planning on going as well, definitely drop us a message and let’s\ntry to meet up at the conference!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the NYC Blockchain Week Recap part of this Community Update.

There, the team demonstrated the long-awaited Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet, for the first time ever and was able to make a huge leap forward by connecting directly with the crypto community.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921\"><strong>Toward the Particl Open Marketplace</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921\"><em>The coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

However, we were pleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl Open Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the booth.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-EfxiVhuXxFqWGObfPo_PWA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Max Keiser at the Particl booth</figcaption></figure><p>Usually, most people don’t like when a platform is exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has proven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its native coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain private, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to. The ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform intended to be used by all crypto users.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-Pav2psmSB0_-bZa0z8pRQw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>One of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest from the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all, the first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto users, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.</p><p>We can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors, developers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore crypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable feedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to showcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical Crypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure and is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!</p><h2 id=\"consensus\">Consensus</h2><p>Whereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know about the Open Marketplace, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019\"><strong>Consensus</strong></a> meant business!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-nARXbCJNMcUjiJmrCPgKWQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty expensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping $1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people, making the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This actually turned out to be a good thing.</p><p>Like many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the previous edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing around for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a sour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical Crypto Conference was created in the first place.</p><h3 id=\"smaller-but-better-crowd\">Smaller but Better Crowd</h3><p>This year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The quality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts and figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto fans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives, many team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all resulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain solutions could disrupt their respective industries.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-voIPMRhL2RfDNElVliA1gg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>And as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team. It has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major vendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a trustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact, we have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of Particl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their businesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with them.</p><h3 id=\"disrupting-of-supply-chains\">Disrupting of Supply Chains</h3><p>Particl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers and vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what some of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that the Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow system, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how supply chains operate in a major way.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-I9y28fq0kQ51wJolPi9_SQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by getting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely moving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various applications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply chains, hiding R&#x26;D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading goods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.</p><p>From all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed to be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the Open Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely avoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely groundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.</p><p>Seeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one of the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.</p><h3 id=\"great-connections\">Great Connections</h3><p>Aside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve had quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the space, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it less chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.</p><p>We are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and we’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors that have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.</p><h3 id=\"insights-right-from-the-trenches\">Insights Right From the Trenches</h3><p>Not only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those discussions have also been extremely insightful to the team.

Whereas last year was focused on building the base\nlayer for the Open Marketplace, this year has been all about refining it and\nstarting to add new features on top of it. That doesn’t mean, however, that the\nonly milestones reached this year were about the marketplace! Here’s a complete\nlist of all the accomplishments and deliverables Particl had so far this year:\n\nParticl Copay 5.4.1 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44] (Jan 17th): A\nnew version of Particl Copay was released on the 17th of January and marked a\nrenewed active development for Particl’s mobile application.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the\nnetwork as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the\nfunctioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing\nmessages around the network and make the governance system work.

While we initially intended to move entirely on Discord and put\nTelegram in read-only mode, our travels around the world have made it clear we\ncouldn’t do that as some countries exclusively use Telegram. Nevertheless, the\nteam has been mostly moved over there and our Discord server will be the main\nplatform we’ll focus on moving forward even though we will keep our Telegram\nchannel open.\n\nParticl is Officially Moving to Discord\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nThe Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever\nsince\nwe abandoned Slack more than a year…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\n\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d] \n(March 8th): On the 8th March, Particl reached a big milestone by releasing its\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on testnet.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big\nconference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and\nintroducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community.\nNot only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also\nproved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major\nconferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto\nConference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace\nwould be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect\nour commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first\nmainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions\nenabled by default.\n\nAdditionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the\nBitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after\nBitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the\nrelease of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of\ntime the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the\nescrow mechanism.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the network as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the functioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing messages around the network and make the governance system work. The hardfork went through without any issue and the network is now ready for the mainnet release of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83\"><strong>Hardfork Successful</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83\"><em>?

While we initially intended to move entirely on Discord and put Telegram in read-only mode, our travels around the world have made it clear we couldn’t do that as some countries exclusively use Telegram. Nevertheless, the team has been mostly moved over there and our Discord server will be the main platform we’ll focus on moving forward even though we will keep our Telegram channel open.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\"><strong>Particl is Officially Moving to Discord</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\"><em>The Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever since we abandoned Slack more than a year…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\">particl.news</a></p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><strong>Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 Released</strong></a><strong> (March 8th):</strong> On the 8th March, Particl reached a big milestone by releasing its Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on testnet.

This release marked the completion of the base layer of the marketplace, meaning that the development team could now start focusing on adding features on top of it.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><strong>Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 Release &amp; Development Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><em>It’s finally here!

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference. The team made great connections at the event and was able to gather a lot of feedback which we’ve used since then to improve the look and feel of the product.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/token2049-a-recap-review-a29d28151e0e\"><strong>TOKEN2049: A Recap &amp; Review</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/token2049-a-recap-review-a29d28151e0e\"><em>It’s one week past the big event and by now, all Particl participants have safely made it back home.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the network as well as paid SMSG messages.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for the biggest event of the year in\ncrypto: the NYC Blockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events]. There, \nthey will finally reveal the Open Marketplace on the real Particl network, the\nmainnet, for the first time ever!\n\nAnd that Open Marketplace is not “just another marketplace”, it is a world\nfirst: a decentralized marketplace, fully autonomous and private, for a new\ncustomer and seller experience\n\nIf you don’t know about it, let us present it to you!\n\nIn this blog post, we will tell you about:\n\n * The Particl Open Marketplace\n * The NYC Blockchain Week\n * The road to the marketplace & how we got there\n * The current state of development, and more\n\nWhat’s the Particl Open Marketplace?\nSimply put, the Open Marketplace is an entirely decentralized marketplace where\nyou can buy and sell products and services to anyone else in the world, in full\nprivacy. Think Alibaba or eBay, but on the blockchain and without a company\nbeing in control of the platform. This means there is no risk of a third party\nusing its position of power to spy on you and impose its arbitrary rules and\nfees.\n\nThe marketplace is fully autonomous, meaning that it doesn’t require any\nthird-party or intermediary to function. It instead restores the balance of\npower back to the people by using a combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer\ntechnologies. The absence of intermediaries alone is enough to bring the cost of\nselling on the platform to a near-zero level.\n\nThis means both vendors and buyers end up with more money in their pockets.\nBecause vendors make more profit per sale, they can reduce their prices to\nincrease their volume and beat the competition. This, in turn, means customers\ncan potentially gain access to cheaper products!\n\nThe Particl Open Marketplace also utilizes a combination of various security\nmeasures and privacy protocols to ensure that none of your data can be accessed\nby anyone. It is a “private by default” marketplace, meaning that you don’t need\nto take any extra step in order to protect your data — it’s just the way Particl\nis.\n\nParticl at the NYC Blockchain Week\nThe NYC Blockchain Week is a series of many crypto events happening within the\nsame timeframe in New York. It attracts the biggest names in the industry,\nshowcases the best blockchain projects, and unites the many different crypto\ncommunities together for one exciting week. In a way, the NYC Blockchain Week is\nto crypto what the World Cup is to football.\n\nParticl in NYC\nParticl is, of course, going to be a part of this event. In fact, you’ll be able\nto come to meet us, right at our booth, at either Magical Crypto Conference or \nConsensus. That’s right! We’ll be having a booth at the two best conferences NYC\nBlockchain Week 2019 has to offer and we’ll be demonstrating the Particl Open\nMarketplace, in exclusivity, on mainnet!\n\nMagical Crypto Conference (MCC)—11th & 12th of May\nThe Magical Crypto Conference [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/] is a\npure crypto-community conference. It is organized and hosted by the well known\n“Magical Crypto Friends”, a group of 4 influencers in the crypto space: Charlie\nLee (Litecoin), Samson Mow (Blockstream CSO), Ricardo Spagni (Monero), and\n“WhalePanda”\n\nThis is the perfect place to meet potential Open Marketplace users and is the\nreason why we are so excited to be having a booth at this event. In fact, as MCC\nis more of a pure crypto community conference, it attracts some of the crypto\npioneers and people that are already deeply interested by the true vision of\ncryptocurrencies, privacy, decentralization, and personal freedom. A simple look\nat the speaker list [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#speakers] should\ngive you a good idea of the type of people that will attend the event.\n\nConsensus by Coindesk—13th to the 15th of May\nStarted by Coindesk in 2015, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] is one of the first crypto\nconference ever and the most prestigious. It has become the biggest\ncryptocurrency event in the world and is a place where people mean business.\n\nThis will be the ideal place to meet various people from different areas of\nexpertise — media, marketing, law, vendors, suppliers, influencers, and, of\ncourse, crypto fans. Such a varied crowd of people is sure to have a lot of\ndifferent feedback about the Open Marketplace, and we are really excited to see\nthe reaction of these people when faced with a modern blockchain product, on\nmainnet.\n\nHaving a good chunk of the team at Consensus will also be ideal to meet people,\ncraft new relationships, and grow the amount of interest for the Particl\necosystem.\n\nMeet the Team\nThe Particl team is going to be 10 member/representative strong going into these\nconferences.\n\n * Juha (Ludx) — Lead Open Marketplace Developer\n * Gerlof van Ek (Crz) — Lead Designer & Branding, UI/UX, Developer\n * Paul Schmitzer (Litebit) — Project Marketing & Strategy\n * Imran (Imyb) — Commercial & Partner Strategy\n * Cryptoguard — Communications & Strategy\n * Gloria (Katelady) — Communications & Strategy\n * Joe Fisher — eCommerce Strategy (Particl Advisor)\n * Lina Seiche — Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist\n * Desi-Rae Campbell (Cryptoramble) — Education & Awareness\n * Joskye — Education & Awareness\n\nCome to our booth at either MCC or Consensus and have a chat with us. We’ll be\ngiving out PART paper wallets, shirts/hoodies, webcam covers, stickers, pins,\nand, most importantly, you’ll be able to test the Particl Open Marketplace live\non mainnet for the first time ever!\n\nIn the meantime, our other developers are hard at work, as per usual, preparing\nthe final build of the Open Marketplace so that it can be publicly released on\nmainnet.\n\nThe Open Marketplace — 2 Great Years of Development\nThe Open Marketplace is quite something to see. It is a complex combination of\npeer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy\nprotocols. It’s also never been attempted before, most of the development toward\nthe marketplace being true pioneering work. It supports a decentralized and\nprivate cryptocurrency, an entirely decentralized escrow mechanism,\ndecentralized file hosting, metadata leak prevention, and etc.\n\nTo see all of the components and features of the Open Marketplace, read our\nPrivacy in eCommerce blog post by following this link: \nhttps://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155\n\nIt has been under heavy and constant development for nearly two years. Almost\nexactly one year ago, Particl released its first proof-of-concept on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, although with a much more basic version of what it has now become. At the\ntime, a simple buy and sell flow was available, without moderation tools,\nwithout proposals, and without a user interface that’s as stable and\nuser-friendly as it is today.\n\nAll this time, throughout the cold crypto winter, the Particl team has been \nhard\nat work [https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9] to\ndeliver its long-anticipated Open Marketplace on mainnet. This much is evidenced\nnot only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on Github\n[http://github.com/particl] but by the very noticeable progress being made on\nthe Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl\nproject has found itself being ranked high in almost all development-related\nrankings of blockchain projects\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAnd here we are, in New York City, presenting the Particl Open Marketplace live\non the main network for the first time ever!\n\nWhat’s next?\nAfter 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is\nnearly over ?\n\nStarting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain,\nParticl created a first:\n\n→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is\nthought of with maximum privacy and security in mind. Everything on Particl is\nprivate, from its untraceable currency to its marketplace, without forgetting\nits proposal, escrow, messaging, file hosting systems, and more.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning, a lot will come after the release of the Open\nMarketplace on mainnet:\n\n * Advanced Open Marketplace features: secure messaging, privacy transactions,\n   inventory management, in-client package tracking, review system, fiat price\n   pegging, and etc.\n * “Marketplace Bubbles” : your own private market on the particl network!\n * CT Bulletproofs, while still being tested on the test network, will improve\n   drastically the size of privacy transactions for any trades of the network.\n   Don’t forget that Particl uses RingCT technology (on testnet), a first on the\n   Bitcoin codebase!\n * Particl Lightning Network (our first testnet transaction just happened a few\n   days ago\n   [https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n   ) and Atomic Swap, so that anyone can change its Bitcoins, Litecoins,\n   Moneros, and more on the marketplace to buy anything in the blink of an eye!\n * Developer SDK so that anyone can easily build their own decentralized\n   applications on the Particl network.\n\nWe are excited to show what true privacy in eCommerce looks like this week in\nNew York, both at MCC and Consensus conference. Although we may be extremely\nbusy during that time, we will not forget to report everything that happens here\nso that you can live these events with us. If you are there, do not hesitate to\npass at our booth to test the marketplace and get some Particl or Bitcoin\nbranded goodies.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-gZG9HtTiXDgtDcLDGYpbgQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

It is a complex combination of peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy protocols.

This much is evidenced not only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on <a href=\"http://github.com/particl\">Github</a> but by the very noticeable progress being made on the Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl project has found itself being <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9\"><strong>ranked high in almost all development-related rankings of blockchain projects</strong></a>.</p><p>And here we are, in New York City, presenting the <strong>Particl Open Marketplace live on the main network for the first time ever</strong>!</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-rxsJBXQxnvGWIqJb9-_k-A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>After 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is nearly over ?</p><p>Starting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain, Particl created a first:</p><p>→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is thought of with maximum privacy and security in mind.

More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nThis campaign will run until mid-July and give you the opportunity to earn\npoints that can be redeemed against PART prizes and even lifetime staking\nshares. All you need to do to start earning points it to let your friends know\nabout Particl and get them to sign up with us!\n\nRules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community\n * Sign up with your email\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\n> Note: Signing up with us will earn you 1 point. Each friend you get to sign up\nwith us will earn you 1 additional point.\nPrize\n * 1 lifetime staking share per friend that signs up (12+ points required)\n\nBecause the payouts cap has been reached in just under 16 hours, sign up payouts\nare now complete and disabled. But don’t worry, you can still earn PART by\naccumulating staking shares. All you need to do is get more than 10 of your\nfriends to sign up with us!\n\nAfter getting 10 of your friends to sign up with Particl, each additional one\nwill reward you with 1 lifetime share of the revenue made by the Ambassador\nStaking Pool [https://stake.particl.community/].\n\nTo see the first staking share payment round of the campaign, follow this link: \nhttps://explorer.particl.io/block/e559921895d05a53025dcb84f61ea42fd0362a786d3e848e640015755ba9f0d4\n\nHow to Claim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, all you need to do is send us, by email, a private address.\nDon’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy to acquire.

The Particl\nAwareness Campaign has been overwhelmingly successful in a short period of time!\nWe appreciate everyone’s effort as we’ve had more than 18,000 people\nparticipating, and 2,000 unique downloads of the marketplace. Thank you for\nparticipating, and please join https://t.me/particlawareness for any questions\nyou may have.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou and your friends are going to love using Particl!\n\nRecently, we introduced Community Contract Pools, a decentralized and\ncommunity-led program designed to fund various initiatives to raise awareness.\nWe’ve also announced that we’re kick-starting this new ‘pool economy’ by\ncreating an awareness campaign to acquire users before the imminent launch of\nour decentralized marketplace. This will be the first-ever initiative to be\nbacked by a Community Contract Pool!\n\nNow for all the nitty gritty details! We believe we’ve designed the best and\nmost innovative campaign to gain traction on our marketplace and get it started\non the right foot.\n\nEarn $PART Coins Just for Signing Up!\nGrab the products you’re looking for and pay for them with crypto!The Awareness\nCampaign’s mission is to acquire new users and kick-start the Particl economy,\nplain and simple. More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nA provably effective technique to acquire new users in the startup world is the\ntraditional referral system — get a friend to try the platform, and get some\nbenefits in return. We all know the very popular Dropbox referral model that, in\nexchange for referring friends, gives you free additional storage capacity on\nyour account.\n\nEarn More by Getting Your Friends to Sign Up!\nThe first Awareness Campaign is indeed a referral program, and it’s a damn good\none! It leverages Community Contract Pools to make it very appealing to\nparticipate in, as you’ll see. The rules are super simple.\n\nAwareness Campaign Rules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community/\n * Register with your email to start participating in the campaign\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n\nPrizes\nGetting friends to use Particl is easy! Each friend you get to sign up nets you\n1 point and points earn you prizes paid in $PART.\n\n * Get $5 worth of $PART for signing up\n * Get $10 worth of $PART when 5 of your friends sign up\n * Get $20 worth of $PART when 10 of your friends sign up\n * Get 1 lifetime staking share per additional friend that signs up (10+)\n\nHow to Claim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, all you need to do is send us, by email, a private address.\nDon’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy to acquire. Simply follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Download Particl Desktop [https://particl.io/downloads/] (mainnet)\n * Create a new account (make sure to backup your seed somewhere safe!)\n * Go to the RECEIVE tab located in the sidebar on the left\n * Click on the Private Address tab located at the top of the RECEIVE page\n * Click on the green Copy Address button to copy it to your clipboard\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\nHow to get your Particl private address and claim your rewards> Note: Payouts will exclusively be made using Confidential Transactions and\nrequire that you send us a private address. That means regular addresses, such\nas those used by exchanges, won’t work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLifetime Staking Shares as Reward\nIn fact, participants who successfully get more than 10 of their friends to use\nParticl will earn lifetime shares of the Ambassador Community Contract Pool\n[https://stake.particl.community/]’s staking revenue.\n\nYes, you’ve heard that right!\n\nIf you teach 10 of your friends about the biggest revolution eCommerce has ever\nseen and get them to sign-up, you can start earning a steady income from this\npool for life!\n\nAs mentioned above, each friend you get to use Particl gives you one point. 10\npoints get you $20 worth of PART. But what if you go above and beyond and get\n25, 100, or even 1,000 people to use Particl!\n\nThat’s where it gets interesting…\n\nIn fact, once you reach 12 points, you’ll earn yourself a single share of the\nstaking revenue made by the Ambassador Community Contract Pool. Then, for each\nadditional friend you refer, you’ll get an additional share. Simply put, you get\n(X-11) shares for every friend you get to use Particl.\n\nFor example, if you get 34 (X) people to register their email to the campaign\nand use Particl, you’ll get 24 shares (X-10). If you refer 8 (X) friends, then\nyou’ll get 0 shares, but you’ll still earn $10 worth of PART since you\nsuccessfully got more than 5 of your friends to sign up.\n\nTo learn more about staking shares and the Ambassador Pool, read our Ambassador\nPool FAQ on Particl Wiki by following the link below.\n\nfaq_ambassador * Particl Project Wiki [https://particl.wiki/faq_ambassador]\nThe Ambassador Pool is the first-ever Community Contract Pool to support an\ninitiative.

Then, you’ll get\na custom link that you can send to your friends so they, also, can participate\nin this campaign and discover Particl at the same time.\n\nEach friend you refer to the platform earns you a point. You can earn $10 worth\nof PART if you get 5 friends to use Particl, and $20 worth of PART for 10\nfriends.\n\nOnce you reach 11 points, you’ll start earning lifetime shares of the staking\nrevenue made by the Ambassador Community Contract Pool.\n\nEasy, right? It doesn’t get more complicated than that!\n\nThe Fine Prints\n * The contest will run until the 16th of July, 2019.\n * To claim your prize, you need to send us a private address from the same\n   email you used to register to the campaign. Sending a private address\n   requires Particl Desktop and is not possible to do from Particl’s mobile\n   application.\n * Payouts will be executed for the first time on the 23rd of May 2019, and will\n   then be payed out every 2 weeks after that point.\n * Staking rewards, proportionally to how many shares you own, will be paid for\n   the first time on the 23rd of May 2019, and will then be paid out every 2\n   weeks after that point. Learn more about what are staking rewards here: \n   https://particl.wiki/faq_ambassador\n * The campaign has a hidden payout cap. If the amount of payouts executed\n   exceeds this cap, payouts will be disabled. After that point, it will only be\n   possible to earn staking shares.

It enables fast payments at a\nnear-zero fee and can scale extremely well, making it ideal to accommodate large\nnumbers of transactions per second. The Lightning Network can, in theory,\nsupport many more transactions per second than to credit card providers and\npopular online payment processors.\n\nLND will support the Particl blockchain and allow it to support large amounts of\ntraffic without being negatively impacted by it. It is an important piece for\nthe envisioned Particl technology stack and is instrumental to the network’s\nability to reach mainstream adoption.\n\nWhat the Lightning Network also enables is the decentralized, cross-chain\nexchange of cryptocurrencies. When two blockchains both have compatible\nLightning Network implementations running, cross-chain cryptocurrency trades can\nbe executed without any intermediary being required to ensure both parties stay\nhonest and honor their end of the deal. This type of exchange is very similar to\natomic swaps, but potentially more flexible.\n\nWhat are the Benefits?\nThe Lightning Network provides many benefits to the blockchains that are\ncompatible with it and opt to implement it.\n\nInstant Payments\nLightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation\ntimes. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a\nblockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in\nmilliseconds to seconds.\n\nScalability\nCapable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.\nCapacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching\npayment per action/click is now possible without custodians.\n\nLow Cost\nBy transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for \nexceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant\nmicro-payments.\n\nCross Blockchains\nCross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous\nblockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can support the same\ncryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across\nblockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.\n\n> Source: https://lightning.network/\nTest it Yourself!\nIt is now possible to test the Lightning Network yourself! Because the\nimplementation is currently pretty bare-bone, it is mostly recommended for\nadvanced users. If you would like to give it a go, use Tecnovert’s Particl LND\nscript displayed below.\n\n> Note: This script runs on RegTest (pre-testnet)\nIf you have questions about Particl LND, join our Discord channel\n[http://discord.me/particl] and look for the #testing or #Open-Development \nchannel.\n\nSo What’s Next?\nThere is still a lot to do, more stability to achieve, and more testing required\nbefore Particl LND can be used with real funds. This script lays the foundation\nof what will later become a much more user-friendly integration of the Lightning\nNetwork on Particl, but at the moment, it is still reserved for the more\nadvanced users.\n\nOne thing we are particularly excited with is the integration of Confidential\nTransactions onto the Lightning Network, or what we like to call Blinded \nLightning. This untraceable version of the Lightning Network will become an\nimportant piece of Particl’s technology stack and will let the public benefit\nfrom a lightning fast currency that provably respects their right to privacy!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-0sXEQ34b__FVXhqUwAGKLg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"-first-testnet-particl-lnd-transaction-successful-\">⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️</h3><p>Last week, Particl’s Core Developer and Cryptographer, <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>, successfully conducted the first ever Particl Lightning Network (LND) transaction.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/bd6f69315e9413e5f8b987fb676d192c28e8e1b15a611701bf1cdecb090f9552\">https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/bd6f69315e9413e5f8b987fb676d192c28e8e1b15a611701bf1cdecb090f9552</a> <strong>(Fee: 0.00000963 PART)</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/aa55ef38ee1f619de8ea00d02a403f2508bae87d98978d868230e8a67e804b72\">https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/aa55ef38ee1f619de8ea00d02a403f2508bae87d98978d868230e8a67e804b72</a> <strong>(Fee: 0.00001831 PART)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-fxMVOo_ApxLtXbDogpDLPQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Transaction Fee: Fee: 0.00000963 PART</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-lightning-network\">What’s the Lightning Network?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-jG2LXZO6B7tHk23aKP14tg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>https://blockstream.com/lightning/</figcaption></figure><p>The Lightning Network (LND) is a payment protocol that runs parallel to a blockchain.
