It was the first blockchain to \nnatively integrate Segwit and have it enabled for all of its transactions, the\nfirst project to integrate RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase\nother than Cryptonote), the first project to implement\n[https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d]\nConfidential\nTransactions (CT)\n[https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d] on\nBitcoin’s codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d] and push it\nonto mainnet, the first project to implement\n[https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34]cold\nstaking [https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34] \nfor its entire mainnet network, and the first project to enable a true PoS (not \ndPoS [https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/] or \ndBFT [https://thebitcoinnews.com/what-is-delegated-byzantine-fault-tolerance/])\ncoin to safely cold stake from a hardware device\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae] \n(Ledger Nano S). To make all of this a reality, the Particl developers have been\nproducing a lot of high-quality code, earning the team a spot within the top\ntiers of several Github audit reports/reviews\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAll of these achievements are surely impressive, especially coming from a team\nthat’s relatively quite small compared to other projects producing similar\namount [http://coincodecap.com] and quality of code (a look at the contributors\nsection of this code quality ranking [http://coincodecap.com] tells everything\nyou need to know). But what this story fails to mention is that none of the\naccomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the\nproject, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product. In\nfact, all of them exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the security,\nprivacy, stability, and scalability of the network in prevision for the mainnet\nrelease of Particl’s first application: the Open Marketplace.\n\nThe Open Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is a product that’s been in the making for quite some time\nand has proven to be a huge undertaking due to its extremely ambitious nature.\n\nIn short, it is an entirely trustless marketplace with full privacy baked in by\ndefault and with almost no fee at all. The fact that it is trustless means that\nit can function autonomously and without any third-party having to get involved\nat any point in time. This allows fees to be brought down to the bare minimum\nand completely eliminates the trust factor involved when making online sales and\npurchases.\n\nIts privacy aspect, which probably is the most groundbreaking aspect of the Open\nMarketplace, makes it so that all purchases and sales you make are verifiably\nprivate/anonymous. Whatever you do within the platform generates no identifiable\ndata at all, meaning that it can’t be harvested by Particl or any other\nthird-party other than the one you are transacting with. In other words, nothing\nyou do on Particl’s Open Marketplace can leave any trace behind.\n\nThis privacy aspect truly is a revolution within the eCommerce industry, an\nindustry that has made its fortune preying on its own users by collecting their\ndata, without their consent, in order to get profits and influence.\n\nThe simple fact that no other project has ever attempted to build a completely\ntrustless marketplace with rock solid privacy built directly at its core speaks\nabout the complexity of the task. Being the first at doing something also means\nvery few examples and proofs-of-concept are out there to help pave the way\nforward, but it also means that you can create a niche audience around your “new\nway” and capitalize on it!\n\nEven though a lot of development progress has been made to the Open Marketplace\nin 2018, the fact it has only been operable on testnet for the entire year has\nmade people more eager than ever to see some kind of mainnet release and finally\nget their hands on a working version of this groundbreaking technology.\n\nMainnet is Finally Upon Us!\nThe days where the Open Marketplace is only available as a testnet product are\ncoming to an end. We’ve stated in the past we wanted this year to be different\nin nature from the previous one, and so let’s start it with a bang! Whereas 2018\nwas solely focused on development, 2019 will see much more action with the\nrelease of the Open Marketplace on mainnet. The best part? The mainnet release\nof the Alpha version of Particl’s Open Marketplace is now imminent!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Timeline\nAs stated in an answer\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-1-fe6a3f3014c2#3a6d] to a\nquestion asked during our latest AMA/FAQ session, one of the decisions the\nParticl team has taken in South Africa has been to focus on making the current\nAlpha version of the marketplace completely stable and move it onto mainnet as\nsoon as that stability is reached. In other words, in just a short time, it will\nfinally be possible to buy and sell real goods and services on Particl’s Open\nMarketplace and do it with real coins!\n\nAlpha Development Phase Ends and Releases on Mainnet\nThe current Alpha version contains all the necessary tools for basic eCommerce\nto be possible, including weighted decentralized governance to keep it clean\n(which is currently available internally, but is not merged on public testnet\njust yet). Once Alpha is successfully moved onto mainnet, it will mark the end\nof the Alpha period for the Open Marketplace and the beginning of the Beta\nphase.\n\nAlpha Mainnet Features\nIf you’ve played with recent versions of the marketplace on testnet, then you\nwill find yourself within a familiar environment when running it on mainnet. All\nof the features introduced throughout the year on testnet will now be available,\nand very stable, within a real-life environment. There is no better way to test\nfeatures, especially those relying on game-theory such as the MAD escrow and the\ndecentralized governance mechanism, than to put them into the wild where real\nfunds and incentives are involved.\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that, as the current switch from testnet\nto mainnet won’t require any sort of hardfork, the first mainnet version of the\nOpen Marketplace won’t process transactions using Particl’s RingCT protocol \nwhich will stay on testnet for the time being. What this means is that \nmarketplace transactions will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is\nfully implemented into the escrow system at some point in time during Beta’s\ndevelopment phase.\n\nThe mainnet version of the Open Marketplace Alpha will contain these features:\n\n * Buy and sell real products and services with real coins\n * Trustless and fee-less escrow mechanism without RingCT privacy\n * Decentralized governance mechanism to flag listings\n * Community proposals\n\nBeta Development Phase Begins Soon (Testnet)\nWhile the Alpha mainnet version of the marketplace will allow anyone in the\nworld to buy and sell real goods and services using real coins, it will only\ninclude the basic functions that make eCommerce possible. The Beta phase of\ndevelopment, which will run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version, is aimed at\nbuilding the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce\nexperience and slowly integrating them as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nThis phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for\nthe marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features. For this reason,\nBeta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact\nthat every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of\nthe features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta\nphase:\n\n * Inventory management\n * Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)\n * Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging\n   will likely be integrated in more than one way)\n * Private markets (or “Bubbles)\n * Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)\n * Escrow recovery and refunds\n * A section for wanted items\n * Shipping carrier integration\n * …and more (click here)!\n   [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a]\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n> Note: The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon\nas the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each\nnew Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release\nCandidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features\nare not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\nBranching Off\nAs discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see\nits development be split into two branches: the Development branch, and the\nStable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will\nmake testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds\neasier to share with friends.\n\nThe Development branch will be where all the newly introduced features first get\nadded. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues,\nthis simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super\nstable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but\nis necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly\nby the more advanced types of user.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, a new branch, the Stable branch, will be introduced\nwhere only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to\nhave a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also\nhave all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features\nthat will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed\nthrough the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much\nmore enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing\nwith other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).\n\nIn simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it\nwill first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the\nrougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the\nfeature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of\ntesting. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto\nmainnet and able to be used with real funds.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nIt would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace\non mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project\nand the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by\neveryone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the\neCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data\nand shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to\noffer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless,\nprivate-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can\nparticipate.\n\nWhat’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to\nspend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire\ncryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No\nmore will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to\nbuy stuff with crypto.\n\nThis release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of\nblockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at\nthis time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group\nof projects that have a product live on mainnet!\n\nWhile this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the\nfirst full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably\nfunctioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real\ncrypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the\nproject on all angles.\n\nWe cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you\nand watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

It was the first blockchain to <strong>natively integrate Segwit</strong> and have it enabled for all of its transactions, the first project to integrate <strong>RingCT</strong> on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote), the first project to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\">implement </a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\"><strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\"> on Bitcoin’s codebase</a> and push it onto mainnet, the first project to <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34\">implement </a><a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34\"><strong>cold staking</strong></a> for its entire mainnet network, and the first project to enable a true PoS (not <a href=\"https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/\">dPoS</a> or <a href=\"https://thebitcoinnews.com/what-is-delegated-byzantine-fault-tolerance/\">dBFT</a>) coin to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>safely cold stake from a hardware device</strong></a> (Ledger Nano S). To make all of this a reality, the Particl developers have been producing a lot of high-quality code, earning the team a spot within the top tiers of <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9\">several Github audit reports/reviews</a>.</p><p>All of these achievements are surely impressive, especially coming from a <a href=\"http://coincodecap.com\">team that’s relatively quite small compared to other projects producing similar amount</a> and quality of code (a look at the contributors section of <a href=\"http://coincodecap.com\">this code quality ranking</a> tells everything you need to know). But what this story fails to mention is that none of the accomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the project, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product. In fact, all of them exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the security, privacy, stability, and scalability of the network in prevision for the <strong>mainnet release</strong> of Particl’s first application: the Open Marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"the-open-marketplace\">The Open Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-NK_QEHjFX4l0rjIwuXfaoA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The Open Marketplace is a product that’s been in the making for quite some time and has proven to be a huge undertaking due to its extremely ambitious nature.</p><p>In short, it is an <strong>entirely trustless marketplace with full privacy baked in by default and with almost no fee at all</strong>. The fact that it is trustless means that it can function autonomously and without any third-party having to get involved at any point in time. This allows fees to be brought down to the bare minimum and completely eliminates the trust factor involved when making online sales and purchases.</p><p>Its privacy aspect, which probably is the most groundbreaking aspect of the Open Marketplace, makes it so that all purchases and sales you make are verifiably private/anonymous. Whatever you do within the platform generates no identifiable data at all, meaning that it can’t be harvested by Particl or any other third-party other than the one you are transacting with. In other words, nothing you do on Particl’s Open Marketplace can leave any trace behind.</p><p>This privacy aspect truly is a <strong>revolution within the eCommerce industry</strong>, an industry that has made its fortune preying on its own users by collecting their data, without their consent, in order to get profits and influence.</p><p>The simple fact that no other project has ever attempted to build a completely trustless marketplace with rock solid privacy built directly at its core speaks about the complexity of the task. Being the first at doing something also means very few examples and proofs-of-concept are out there to help pave the way forward, but it also means that you can create a niche audience around your “new way” and capitalize on it!</p><p>Even though a lot of development progress has been made to the Open Marketplace in 2018, the fact it has only been operable on testnet for the entire year has made people more eager than ever to see some kind of mainnet release and finally get their hands on a working version of this groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"mainnet-is-finally-upon-us-\">Mainnet is Finally Upon Us!</h2><p>The days where the Open Marketplace is only available as a testnet product are coming to an end. We’ve stated in the past we wanted this year to be different in nature from the previous one, and so let’s start it with a bang! Whereas 2018 was solely focused on development, 2019 will see much more action with the release of the Open Marketplace on mainnet. The best part? <strong>The mainnet release of the Alpha version of Particl’s Open Marketplace is now imminent!</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"the-timeline\">The Timeline</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-CG1uULpg0YcDHmdA3af8dQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As stated in an <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-1-fe6a3f3014c2#3a6d\"><strong>answer</strong></a> to a question asked during our latest AMA/FAQ session, one of the decisions the Particl team has taken in South Africa has been to focus on making the current Alpha version of the marketplace completely stable and move it onto mainnet as soon as that stability is reached. In other words, in just a short time, it will finally be possible to <strong>buy and sell real goods and services </strong>on Particl’s Open Marketplace and do it with <strong>real coins</strong>!</p><h3 id=\"alpha-development-phase-ends-and-releases-on-mainnet\">Alpha Development Phase Ends and Releases on Mainnet</h3><p>The current Alpha version contains all the necessary tools for basic eCommerce to be possible, including weighted decentralized governance to keep it clean (which is currently available internally, but is not merged on public testnet just yet). Once Alpha is successfully moved onto mainnet, it will mark the end of the Alpha period for the Open Marketplace and the beginning of the Beta phase.</p><h3 id=\"alpha-mainnet-features\">Alpha Mainnet Features</h3><p>If you’ve played with recent versions of the marketplace on testnet, then you will find yourself within a familiar environment when running it on mainnet. All of the features introduced throughout the year on testnet will now be available, and very stable, within a real-life environment. There is no better way to test features, especially those relying on game-theory such as the MAD escrow and the decentralized governance mechanism, than to put them into the wild where real funds and incentives are involved.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that, as the current switch from testnet to mainnet <strong>won’t require any sort of hardfork</strong>, the first mainnet version of the Open Marketplace<strong> won’t process transactions using Particl’s RingCT protocol</strong> which will stay on testnet for the time being. What this means is that <strong>marketplace transactions will be pseudonymous, not anonymous</strong>, until RingCT is fully implemented into the escrow system at some point in time during Beta’s development phase.</p><p>The mainnet version of the Open Marketplace Alpha will contain these features:</p><ul><li>Buy and sell real products and services with real coins</li><li>Trustless and fee-less escrow mechanism <strong>without RingCT privacy</strong></li><li>Decentralized governance mechanism to flag listings</li><li>Community proposals</li></ul><h3 id=\"beta-development-phase-begins-soon-testnet-\">Beta Development Phase Begins Soon (Testnet)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-wjnOCuj7RO9udfXb_PWj4A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>While the Alpha mainnet version of the marketplace will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell real goods and services using real coins, it will only include the basic functions that make eCommerce possible. The Beta phase of development, which will <strong>run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version</strong>, is aimed at building the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce experience and slowly integrating them as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate\"><strong>Release Candidates</strong></a>. This phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!</p><p><strong>Whereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for the marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features.</strong> For this reason, Beta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact that every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of the features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta phase:</p><ul><li>Inventory management</li><li>Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)</li><li>Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging will likely be integrated in more than one way)</li><li>Private markets (or “Bubbles)</li><li>Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)</li><li>Escrow recovery and refunds</li><li>A section for wanted items</li><li>Shipping carrier integration</li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a\"><strong>…and more (click here)!</strong></a></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon as the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each new Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"branching-off\">Branching Off</h3><p>As discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see its development be <strong>split into two branches</strong>: the Development branch, and the Stable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will make testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds easier to share with friends.</p><p>The <strong>Development branch</strong> will be where all the newly introduced features first get added. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues, this simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super stable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but is necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly by the more advanced types of user.</p><p>For the sake of convenience, a new branch, the <strong>Stable branch</strong>, will be introduced where only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to have a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also have all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features that will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed through the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much more enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing with other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).</p><p>In simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it will first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the feature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto mainnet and able to be used with real funds.</p><hr><h2 id=\"biggest-milestone-to-date\">Biggest Milestone to Date</h2><p>It would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace on mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project and the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by everyone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the eCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data and shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to offer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless, private-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can participate.</p><p>What’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to spend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire cryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No more will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to buy stuff with crypto.</p><p>This release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of blockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at this time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group of projects that have a product live on mainnet!</p><p>While this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the first full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably functioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real crypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the project on all angles.</p><p>We cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you and watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!</p><hr><p>Want to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious eCommerce in general?

This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will make testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds easier to share with friends.</p><p>The <strong>Development branch</strong> will be where all the newly introduced features first get added. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues, this simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super stable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but is necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly by the more advanced types of user.</p><p>For the sake of convenience, a new branch, the <strong>Stable branch</strong>, will be introduced where only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to have a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also have all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features that will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed through the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much more enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing with other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).</p><p>In simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it will first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the feature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto mainnet and able to be used with real funds.</p><hr><h2 id=\"biggest-milestone-to-date\">Biggest Milestone to Date</h2><p>It would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace on mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project and the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by everyone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the eCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data and shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to offer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless, private-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can participate.</p><p>What’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to spend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire cryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No more will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to buy stuff with crypto.</p><p>This release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of blockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at this time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group of projects that have a product live on mainnet!</p><p>While this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the first full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably functioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real crypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the project on all angles.</p><p>We cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you and watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!</p><hr><p>Want to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious eCommerce in general?

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
