We understand not everyone is\nlooking at their portfolio every day, and believe long-term holders should have\na second opportunity to claim PART.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo SDC Holder Left Behind! — A cause worth donating to!\nsource: usatoday.comBrief:\nThe goal of this cause is to create a reserve pool of PART that will provide an\nextended period of time for holders of SDC to exchange for PART. Funding for\nthis proposal will come from any donations made by the entire community who want\nto allocate a percentage of their bonus from the 80% distribution of unclaimed\nPART. Additional funding will come from a match by the foundation via the 20%\ndistribution it receives as part of the 80/20 split\n[https://particl.news/unclaimed-part-and-the-80-20-split-4f5190b0fab3]. Donating\nto this cause is purely optional, each user will have the option to opt-in\nwithin their dashboard.\n\nIndividuals on the Particl Team have already committed to donate at least 25%\nand in some cases 100% of their 80% distribution. These are all personal funds.\nIf every token holder were to pay forward 25% of the 80% distribution this would\nhelp build a significant reserve pool of PART available to claim. Again,\nchoosing to participate in this cause is 100% optional.\n\nParticl Foundation Match\nThe Particl Foundation would like to match all donations to a 20% rate with an\naggregate limit of 40,000 PART. In layman’s terms, if the donations for this\ncause reach 200,000 PART, the Particl Foundation will match with a maximum\ndonation of 40,000 PART. The funds for this match will come from the 20% bonus\nallocation it receives per the 80/20 split.\n\nMuch Flair Very Prestige\nOk, so it’s not a mobile with the Particl Market pre-installed, but it will make\nyou feel good!

The team\nrequested trading to halt at the end of the exchange to allow token holders a\nchance to participate in PART. Trading on SDC continued through the funding\nperiod and held its 60-day median value until April 19th 00:00 UTC when it\nplunged in value due to delisting requirements. This timestamp artificially\ncreated a break in the cost of entry to PART.\n\nHow did you come up with the 2:1 ratio?\nSDC held it’s value at $1.50 to $1.70 throughout the token exchange time frame.\nParticipants who exchanged during the 4 week window could exchange 1:1 which\nheld the market price value or exchange at 1:1.15 (15% bonus) which was below\nmarket price value in the 1st half of the 4 weeks and over $2 per PART in the\n2nd half of the 4 weeks.
