we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate, though we've got exciting and exclusive news to share.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nAs announced earlier today on X by mainnet_pat\n[https://x.com/mainnet_pat/status/1857335162125648102], one of the main\ncontributors to the BCH <> XMR atomic swap protocol, the integration of Bitcoin\nCash on BasicSwap DEX has been extensively tested on mainnet and is now ready\nfor release.\n\nWe have thus merged a substantial series of commits\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35] \nto the dev branch (more specifically, commits dated today November 15th),\nenabling users to test the Bitcoin Cash integration on mainnet. We anticipate\nbringing this integration to the master branch during our next dev -> master \nmerge.\n\nCommits · basicswap/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\nbasicswap/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35]\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to mainnet_pat for his exceptional work on this\nintegration. This valuable community contribution strengthens BasicSwap's\ndecentralized approach and represents another significant step toward achieving\nour mission.\n\nBasicSwap Codebase Improvements ✅\nAlong with today's large array of commits that have been added to the dev \nbranch, we've included a number of general codebase improvements and code\nclean-ups.\n\nNotably, we've resolved an issue with Monero wallets which should resolve a\nlong-standing issue that made BasicSwap become slower the longer you had been\nrunning your instance. This fix is a combination of BasicSwap improvements and\naccompanying fixes that have been published as pull requests to Monero earlier\ntoday (1 [https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9571], 2\n[https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9570]).\n\nOther updates, committed on November 15th\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev], include:\n\n * Large code formatting update, including tests (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555]\n   , 2\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/7b03ce476997ceee5f6b227c8a1b028175ed5b74]\n   )\n * Allow setting reserve below increment for market making script (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/373525b364249c493cc4dbd90fcfd62c38f009ff]\n   )\n * basicswap-prepare: don't start daemon if coin config exists in basicswap.json\n   (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/6be9a14335ac5b7893b231fd33983462bf90a93c]\n   )\n * Bypass Tor for .local domains (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b484827c15fdc306a9dc8b6ce52117371142dcc0]\n   )\n * Fix error when txid is unknown (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/51c11793265045edce7239372748dc74cfea2664]\n   )\n * Fix unbound error when no wallet data is cached (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b5f6eb65262fed1b731003b8248e34db57a32b45]\n   )\n * Adjust wallet name for Particl anon and blind interfaces (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/e28d41ed0caf4c3c28e6fbbf4d3385b48f7f38d6]\n   )\n * Add display_name to chainparams (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/00d70f8cc72096f6f132d108a453d0512ad22c47]\n   )\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWhile we have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer as\nreported last week, we've chosen to focus this week's front-end efforts on\nBasicSwap GUI updates. These updates will begin rolling out to the dev branch in\ngreater numbers over the next few days.\n\nThe installer release remains imminent. However, we want to clarify that this\ninstaller is simply a tool to facilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on\nWindows. For Windows users, we continue to recommend using the Docker version,\nwhich remains our only officially supported Windows implementation. We do not\nrecommend running BasicSwap directly on Windows.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1855017656576839694]Don't miss our upcoming\nPrivacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX and Firo this coming\n20th of November at 9:00 AM EST!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing\nmoderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core\nvalues of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden\non users.\n\nBuilt using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It\nanalyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models,\nrequiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your\ndata stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively\nto Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing\nenvironment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or\nvirtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.\n\nYou can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: \nhttps://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\n\nHow We Got Here: The Current Moderation System\nThis release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system\n(v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users'\nhands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the\nplatform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and\npro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.\n\nThe current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some\nconceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial\ndifferences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users\nencounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the\napplication, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public\nlist where the community can either support the original flag through additional\ndownvotes or contest it with upvotes.\n\nContent removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary\ndecisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of\nParticl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply\nof 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000\ncoins to be removed.\n\nImportantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since\nParticl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple\naddresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the\nvoting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated\nwithin an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote\ncarries.\n\nAddressing Current Limitations\nWhile this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its\ncontinued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:\n\nFirst, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain\neffective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can\nlead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.\n\nSecond, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must\nbe exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it.\nWhile early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary\ntrade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant\nbarrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.\n\nThese challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to\ndecentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving\nthe marketplace experience.\n\nThe Promise of Local LLM Technology\nThe breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology.\nWhile the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT,\nAnthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's\nprivacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean\nhigher total API costs.\n\nIndeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models.\nThese models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving\naccuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever\nconnecting to third-party service providers.\n\nThis technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve\nParticl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without\ncompromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through\nAPIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced\nscaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.\n\nThe New Automated Moderation Script\nGitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered\ncontent moderation script for Particl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without\nconnections to 3rd-parties.Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for\nParticl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without connections to 3rd-parties. -\ncryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-scriptGitHubcryptoguard\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script]We’re proud to\nintroduce, today, a new script that automates the process of moderating Particl\nMarketplace content with minimal user input.\n\nOperating Modes\nThe script offers two distinct approaches to marketplace moderation: manual mode \nand continuous mode.\n\nScript's main menuIn manual mode, you maintain complete control through a CLI menu interface that\nlets you oversee each step of the process. This gives you the ability to review\nand adjust moderation decisions before they reach the network, making it\nespecially valuable during your initial setup phase or when testing new\nmoderation rules.\n\nOptions for the script's manual modeContinuous mode transforms this process into an autonomous operation. The script\nindependently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings,\nanalyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the\nnetwork. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace\nscan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces\nuser exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only\nafter thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.\n\nRule System and Analysis\nAt the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule\nsystem powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor\nmarketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria.\nEach rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving\nyou precise control over the moderation process.\n\nThe system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language\ndescriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters.\nTo help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules\naccessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing\nimmediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can\nuse them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or\nentirely replace them with custom rules of your own.\n\nFor those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of\ntest listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to\nprohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the\ntest. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules\nbefore deploying them in the live marketplace.\n\nThe Judgement Engine\nProcessed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely\nuser-defined)The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to\ncontent analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and\ndescriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than\nusing potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when\nclassifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true',\n'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible\nand unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without\npredetermined assumptions.\n\nModel Selection and Performance\nAfter extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the\noptimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates\nremarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including\nseveral state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being\nvictim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it\nto run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to\nvirtual private servers.\n\nOur commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making\neffective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge.\nWe're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to\nfurther optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains\nunclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if\nany.\n\nWallet Configuration\nThe script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin controlTo operate\neffectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an\nactive Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up\nyour wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.\n\nThe first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which\nstreamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a\nParticl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves\nspecifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and\ninitializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and\nNode Settings/Initialize Wallet).\n\nThe initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It\nincorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling\nsecure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for\nboth accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system.\nWithout proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings\nor cast votes on content.\n\nVote Broadcasting System\nThe process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach\ndesigned to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the\nfirst time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the\nLLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu,\nwhere you can examine each decision in detail.\n\nDuring this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated\ndecisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves\nparticularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique\ncontent patterns.\n\nOnce satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting\nprocess through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in\nyour wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins\ncontained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically,\nensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the\nintegrity of your voting decisions.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use this application without running a local model? \nA: Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU\nnetwork running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option\nin the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider\navailability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the\ncommunity-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation\nperformance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this\nspace for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent\ncompromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its\nminimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like\nRaspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.\n\nQ: How is my data and privacy protected? \nA: Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script\nconnects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data\ncollection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision\nencoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which\naddresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy\nand data security principles, which guided the script's development.\n\nQ: What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? \nA: Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we\nemphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new\nmoderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until\nyou're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides\nan excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM\ninterprets different content types.\n\nQ: Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? \nA: Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority.\nBuilt using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The\ninstallation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all\ndependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's\nexisting Python packages or other software.\n\nQ: What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous\nmode? \nA: The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it\nto resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will\nautomatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime,\nensuring no content goes unprocessed.\n\nQ: How much storage space does the local LLM model require? \nA: The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The\nscript's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies,\nneed roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about\n2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to\naccommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.\n\nQ: What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? \nA: For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:\n\n * RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)\n * Storage: 6GB free space\n * Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity\n\nNote: The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be\nsignificantly reduced.\n\nQ: How does the script handle network connectivity issues? \nA: The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the\nmarketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at\nregular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored\nlocally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and\nprocesses any listings it missed during the downtime.\n\nQ: Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? \nA: Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their\nown wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each\ninstance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool\naccording to its wallet's stake.\n\nQ: How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? \nA: The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config\ndirectory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the\nrules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or\nused to recover your setup if needed.\n\nQ: Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data? \nA: No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond\nthe expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings\nthan what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided\ntest listings (available from the CLI menu).\n\nQ: How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? \nA: LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and\ninitiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become\navailable, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided\nthat you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).\n\nLooking Forward\nThe release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in\ndecentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve\neffective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy,\ndecentralization, and user autonomy.\n\nThis development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It\nshows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while\nminimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized\ncontrol. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and\nits privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other\ndecentralized projects facing similar challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community\nfeedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the\npotential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates,\nand further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even\nmore efficient and user-friendly.\n\nYour feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this\ntool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in\ndecentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with\ndifferent rules, and share your experiences with the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

The local LLM model examines both listing titles and descriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than using potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when classifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true', 'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible and unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without predetermined assumptions.</p><h3 id=\"model-selection-and-performance\"><strong>Model Selection and Performance</strong></h3><p>After extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the optimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates remarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including several state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being victim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it to run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to virtual private servers.</p><p>Our commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making effective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge. We're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to further optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains unclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if any.</p><h3 id=\"wallet-configuration\"><strong>Wallet Configuration</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"406\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png 669w\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png\" width=\"668\" height=\"401\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png 668w\"></div></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"409\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png 666w\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png\" width=\"661\" height=\"402\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png 661w\"></div></div></div><figcaption><em>The script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin control</em></figcaption></figure><p>To operate effectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an active Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up your wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.</p><p>The first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which streamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a Particl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves specifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and initializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and Node Settings/Initialize Wallet).</p><p>The initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It incorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling secure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for both accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system. Without proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings or cast votes on content.</p><h3 id=\"vote-broadcasting-system\"><strong>Vote Broadcasting System</strong></h3><p>The process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach designed to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the first time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the LLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu, where you can examine each decision in detail.</p><p>During this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated decisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves particularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique content patterns.</p><p>Once satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting process through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in your wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins contained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically, ensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the integrity of your voting decisions.</p><h1 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1><p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I use this application without running a local model? <br><strong>A: </strong>Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU network running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option in the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider availability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the community-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation performance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this space for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent compromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its minimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like Raspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is my data and privacy protected? <br><strong>A:</strong> Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script connects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data collection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision encoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which addresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy and data security principles, which guided the script's development.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? <br><strong>A:</strong> Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we emphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new moderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until you're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides an excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM interprets different content types.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority. Built using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The installation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all dependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's existing Python packages or other software.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous mode? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it to resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing moderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core values of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden on users.</p><p>Built using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It analyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models, requiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your data stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively to Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing environment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or virtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.</p><p><strong>You can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\">https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script</a></strong></p><h2 id=\"how-we-got-here-the-current-moderation-system\"><strong>How We Got Here: The Current Moderation System</strong></h2><p>This release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system (v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users' hands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the platform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and pro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p><p>The current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some conceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial differences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users encounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the application, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public list where the community can either support the original flag through additional downvotes or contest it with upvotes.</p><p>Content removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary decisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of Particl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply of 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000 coins to be removed.</p><p>Importantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since Particl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple addresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the voting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated within an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote carries.</p><h2 id=\"addressing-current-limitations\"><strong>Addressing Current Limitations</strong></h2><p>While this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its continued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:</p><p>First, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain effective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can lead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.</p><p>Second, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must be exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it. While early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary trade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant barrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.</p><p>These challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to decentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving the marketplace experience.</p><h2 id=\"the-promise-of-local-llm-technology\"><strong>The Promise of Local LLM Technology</strong></h2><p>The breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology. While the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean higher total API costs.</p><p>Indeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models. These models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving accuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever connecting to third-party service providers.</p><p>This technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve Particl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without compromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through APIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced scaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.</p><h1 id=\"the-new-automated-moderation-script\">The New Automated Moderation Script</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for Particl Marketplace.

This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible and unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without predetermined assumptions.</p><h3 id=\"model-selection-and-performance\"><strong>Model Selection and Performance</strong></h3><p>After extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the optimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates remarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including several state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being victim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it to run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to virtual private servers.</p><p>Our commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making effective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge. We're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to further optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains unclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if any.</p><h3 id=\"wallet-configuration\"><strong>Wallet Configuration</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"406\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png 600w, /glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png 669w\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png\" width=\"668\" height=\"401\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png 600w, /glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png 668w\"></div></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"409\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png 600w, /glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png 666w\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png\" width=\"661\" height=\"402\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png 600w, /glink/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png 661w\"></div></div></div><figcaption><em>The script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin control</em></figcaption></figure><p>To operate effectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an active Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up your wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.</p><p>The first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which streamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a Particl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves specifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and initializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and Node Settings/Initialize Wallet).</p><p>The initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It incorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling secure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for both accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system. Without proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings or cast votes on content.</p><h3 id=\"vote-broadcasting-system\"><strong>Vote Broadcasting System</strong></h3><p>The process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach designed to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the first time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the LLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu, where you can examine each decision in detail.</p><p>During this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated decisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves particularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique content patterns.</p><p>Once satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting process through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in your wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins contained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically, ensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the integrity of your voting decisions.</p><h1 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1><p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I use this application without running a local model? <br><strong>A: </strong>Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU network running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option in the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider availability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the community-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation performance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this space for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent compromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its minimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like Raspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is my data and privacy protected? <br><strong>A:</strong> Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script connects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data collection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision encoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which addresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy and data security principles, which guided the script's development.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? <br><strong>A:</strong> Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we emphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new moderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until you're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides an excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM interprets different content types.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority. Built using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The installation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all dependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's existing Python packages or other software.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous mode? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it to resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
