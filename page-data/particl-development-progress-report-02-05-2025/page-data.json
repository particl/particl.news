As a\nreminder, this implementation standardizes messages and encrypts them using\nSMSG's methodology, allowing almost any data or messaging network to relay\nBasicSwap messages such as Telegram, IRC, Torrent/P2P networks, and others. As a\nsignificant plus, all messages are encrypted before broadcast, meaning that this\napproach presents minimal privacy compromises.\n\nLight Wallets ?\nAfter completing multi-net support, our next focus will likely be implementing\nsupport for light wallets or remote nodes for most coins available on BasicSwap.\nThis will allow you to set up BasicSwap without syncing a full node or storing\nthe entire blockchain on your device, significantly improving setup time and\nconvenience.\n\nNote that this feature will be offered as an option, allowing you to still set\nup the DEX using full nodes for maximum security and privacy if preferred.\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nIntegrating the current market making tools into BasicSwap's GUI is now this\nmonth's main front-end focus. While we intended to make more progress on it last\nmonth, a lot of time was spent refactoring the UI's back-end code which will pay\noff in the long-term and make BasicSwap better structured and easier for\ncontributors to jump in.\n\nAdvanced Order Book Display ?\nAnother area we plan to advance during the next development cycle is the\naddition of advanced data visualization in the order book, notably depth charts\nfor each trading pair and split order book displaying buy and sell offers on\nseparate sides\n\nThese improvements will bring BasicSwap's order book experience closer to what\nusers expect when interacting with centralized exchanges, bridging the gap\nbetween traditional platforms and decentralized trading—allowing users to enjoy\nconvenience benefits without the typical security trade-offs.\n\nGeneral Updates and Maintenance ⚙️\nIn addition to the major items mentioned above, we plan to investigate and\nimplement a wide variety of general improvements, tweaks, and bug fixes over the\nnext few weeks.\n\nDr. Kap at the Litecoin Summit in May ?️\nDr. Kap will be representing Particl and BasicSwap DEX at this year's edition of\nthe Litecoin Summit on the 29th and 30th of May, 2025\n[https://litecoin.com/summit-2025]. \n\nOn the 29th, he'll give a presentation on BasicSwap DEX which will delve into\nour current short-to-medium term objective of making atomic swaps more\naccessible and intuitive for everyone to use and how we intend to leverage\nBasicSwap's current and upcoming pioneering technology to further the level of\ndecentralization in crypto and eCOmmerce by reducing reliance on central\nparties.\n\nOn the next day, he will participate on a panel focused on privacy with other\ngreat speakers and figures from the scene, including SethForPrivacy (Cake\nWallet), Justin Berman (Monero dev), Joël Valenzuela (Dash), and Paul Puey\n(Edge). \n\n * More information: https://litecoin.com/summit-2025\n\nPART in MEXC Assessment Zone ⚠️\nA few days ago, MEXC placed the PART trading pair in its Assessment Zone due to\nlow order book liquidity and insufficient total value of PART coins deposited on\nthe platform.\n\nWhile this does not constitute a formal delisting yet, the exchange has\ncommunicated that the community must increase both liquidity and the total\nnumber of PART coins held on the exchange to maintain the listing.\n\nTherefore, we invite community members who wish to preserve PART's presence on\nMEXC to consider contributing to order book liquidity and depositing some of\ntheir coins on the exchange.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nFollowing last week's release of BasicSwap v0.14.4, we've reviewed and begun\nwork on the next milestones planned for the new release cycle.\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWhile we've implemented a significant portion of what's required to provide\nBasicSwap with multi-net support (the ability for BasicSwap to relay data\nmessages such as offers, swap data, or identities using networks other than\nSMSG), this new functionality is not yet fully operational.\n\nWe're continuing development in this area and expect to complete a proof of\nconcept using Simplex as the first integrated network relatively soon. As a\nreminder, this implementation standardizes messages and encrypts them using\nSMSG's methodology, allowing almost any data or messaging network to relay\nBasicSwap messages such as Telegram, IRC, Torrent/P2P networks, and others. As a\nsignificant plus, all messages are encrypted before broadcast, meaning that this\napproach presents minimal privacy compromises.\n\nLight Wallets ?\nAfter completing multi-net support, our next focus will likely be implementing\nsupport for light wallets or remote nodes for most coins available on BasicSwap.\nThis will allow you to set up BasicSwap without syncing a full node or storing\nthe entire blockchain on your device, significantly improving setup time and\nconvenience.\n\nNote that this feature will be offered as an option, allowing you to still set\nup the DEX using full nodes for maximum security and privacy if preferred.\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nIntegrating the current market making tools into BasicSwap's GUI is now this\nmonth's main front-end focus. While we intended to make more progress on it last\nmonth, a lot of time was spent refactoring the UI's back-end code which will pay\noff in the long-term and make BasicSwap better structured and easier for\ncontributors to jump in.\n\nAdvanced Order Book Display ?\nAnother area we plan to advance during the next development cycle is the\naddition of advanced data visualization in the order book, notably depth charts\nfor each trading pair and split order book displaying buy and sell offers on\nseparate sides\n\nThese improvements will bring BasicSwap's order book experience closer to what\nusers expect when interacting with centralized exchanges, bridging the gap\nbetween traditional platforms and decentralized trading—allowing users to enjoy\nconvenience benefits without the typical security trade-offs.\n\nGeneral Updates and Maintenance ⚙️\nIn addition to the major items mentioned above, we plan to investigate and\nimplement a wide variety of general improvements, tweaks, and bug fixes over the\nnext few weeks.\n\nPART in MEXC Assessment Zone ⚠️\nA few days ago, MEXC placed the PART trading pair in its Assessment Zone due to\nlow order book liquidity and insufficient total value of PART coins deposited on\nthe platform.\n\nWhile this does not constitute a formal delisting yet, the exchange has\ncommunicated that the community must increase both liquidity and the total\nnumber of PART coins held on the exchange to maintain the listing.\n\nTherefore, we invite community members who wish to preserve PART's presence on\nMEXC to consider contributing to order book liquidity and depositing some of\ntheir coins on the exchange.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
