Robert Edwards\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\n, he’s been relentlessly working on Particl Copay\n[https://particl.wiki/particl-copay], Particl’s mobile application, and started\nmaking a lot of upgrades [https://github.com/particl/copay/commits/master] to it\non Github. This development update will explain in more details what is being\nworked into Particl Copay and what can be expected from the next few versions of\nParticl’s mobile application.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMobile Cold Staking\nOne of the big feature being coded into Particl Copay is the long-awaited cold\nstaking capabilities. In fact, it will soon be possible to connect your funds to\na cold staking node directly from your mobile application and help secure the\nnetwork while growing your PART stash at the same time. Note that, in this case,\nthe Particl Copay mobile wallet won’t be the device actually staking. The update\nwill only enable the possibility to cold stake your funds held on Particl Copay\nby delegating its staking power to a cold staking node.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nWhat if Particl’s Proof-of-Stake algorithm could be taken yet to another level?\nThis is what this next feature is going to do! Not only will Particl Copay’s\ncold staking update introduce the ability to connect your mobile wallet to a\ncold staking node, but it will also introduce multi-signature\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions] \ncold staking. This will allow you to stake your funds held in multi-sig\naddresses, requiring you to have access to more than one device to successfully\nauthorize and execute a transaction.\n\nFor the time being, this will only be compatible with Copay devices. This may or\nmay not change in the future, although the team has already identified ways to\nmake it compatible with Ledger hardware devices. As this feature requires a\nhardfork, it won’t be included in the next update of Particl Copay.\n\niOS Support\nAnother long-awaited feature for Particl’s mobile wallet is official support for\niOS. As many of you know, especially iPhone users, Particl Copay hasn’t been\navailable on iOS since its inception, but that’s about to change! The mobile\napplication has already started to see its code being upgraded\n[https://github.com/particl/copay/commits/master] to be compatible with iOS and,\nat that point, we are only waiting for Apple to confirm Particl’s Apple\nDeveloper Account. When that’s done, we’ll be able to publish the application on\nthe App Store whenever the update is ready to go live! This compatibility update\nshould be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nMulti-Currency Support\nA very useful feature that’s gonna be included in the next update is the ability\nto hold different coins in Particl Copay without having to use multiple wallet\napplications. Indeed, once the update goes live, Particl Copay will have support\nfor Particl, but also Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This should prove very useful\nwhenever Particl’s Open Marketplace starts accepting Bitcoin payments! This\nupdate will be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nUI/UX Improvement\nThose of you already using Particl Copay will notice it right away, this update\nwill introduce several UI/UX improvements all over the app. There is not much to\nsay about this in particular other than the fact that the mobile application has\nbeen improved visually and will offer all of its new features within a very\nuser-friendly and intuitive environment. This update will be available in the\nnext version of Particl Copay.\n\nNotifications\nVarious types of notifications will also be introduced in this update. Whether\nit be incoming or outgoing transactions, staking rewards, or multi-sig\ntransaction requests, the mobile app will now notify you whenever something\nhappens within the app. This update will be available in the next version of\nParticl Copay.\n\nCopay Wallet Emptying Vulnerability Fix\nWhile the current version of Particl Copay isn’t affected by the newly\ndiscovered exploit\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitpays-copay-wallet-compromised-by-malicious-code-firm-issues-advice-for-users] \nthat allowed attackers to empty Bitcoin Copay wallets due to a faulty Node.js\nmodule, this exploit has been revealed to be effective on recent versions of\nBitcoin Copay. This critical vulnerability will be fixed and not be present in\nthe new Particl Copay version.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this new Particl Copay update.\nThis will bring much needed and requested features to the mobile application and\nreally make this wallet a powerful tool both in terms of utility and security.\nSince this is just a development update and not a proper announcement blog post,\nwe recommend you to watch the developments being made to the mobile application\nby going on its Github repository [http://github.com/particl/copay], or to\nsimply keep an eye on our blog [http://particl.news] for any future release\nannouncement.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to see more development updates?

They used\nthis opportunity to record an AMA/FAQ session to answer some of the questions\nthat have been asked on Reddit.\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/a0lbbf/amafaq_with_special_guest_lina_seiche_recording/]\n\nDue to limited time and the unusually high amount of questions received for this\nAMA/FAQ, the team couldn’t answer all the questions while in Toronto but did so\nin the Reddit thread itself. For the purpose of this Community Update, we’ve\ncompiled all the answers, including those answered in the video.\n\n> Video Questions\n(3:01 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=181]) Can we expect in-client messaging\nfor the main net?\nIn-client messaging will be a new feature introduced into the marketplace as we\nwork towards a fully loaded main release. We have a bunch of new features queued\nup on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll\nbe released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will\nbe different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the\nteam will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent\nand exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being\nconsidered/worked on by reading the South Africa development update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11] posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nQ&A Communications on Listing PagesWe do see in-client messaging integrated into\nthe shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of\nthis can be seen in a gif posted on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323] by our UI/UX and\nfront-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a\nseller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users)\ndirectly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&A format used on\nAmazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.\n\nAnother messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group\nchats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a\nstand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities,\nespecially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned \n/r/beertrade Reddit community [https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade]) directly\nwithin Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications.\nThis would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your\nday-to-day life.\n\n(3:49 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229]) Will there be a Decentralized\nExchange integration?\nThe team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration\nat this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team,\nfeel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will\nget some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace\nintegrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a\nreality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a\nChangelly or a similar third-party integration.\n\nWhile a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it\ndoesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the\nParticl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the\nshort-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and\nthat integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the\nvolume.\n\nExample of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)As such, we are\nactively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when\none of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then\nwe might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and\nthen integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d\nkeep the community in the know about any development on that front!\n\n(4:27 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284]) Moving forward, what role will\nMiguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?\nAll of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl.\nMost of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own\ncircles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s\nlatest videos that have been posted on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg] as well as in \nDeutsche Welle’s documentary [https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94] he and Lina Seiche\nwere featured on last month.\n\nDW’s Documentary:\n\nMeeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:\n\nHumans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:\n\nTo date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with\nagendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in\n2019, as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet, we’ll definitely be engaging each of\nour advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social\nmedia, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a\nvery different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production\nphase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of\ntremendous help.\n\nWith Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage\nmore with our advisors from SCI [http://sci.ph], Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon,\nand you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.\n\n(6:22 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382]) Can we expect a fiat gateway\nintegration into the Particl client?\nWe know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is,\nafter all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as\npossible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve\nthis, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one\nof our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of\npayment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream\ntype of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways\n\nWe need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We\nhave looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as\nIndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of\nprivacy and security.\n\nFor the time being, we know Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/] plans on tackling that\naspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!\n\n(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?\nOur legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are\nconstantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to\nplay by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are\nfully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal\nteam stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations.\nCompliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully\nintend on staying that way moving forward.\n\n(8:23 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503]) How will atomic swaps be\nincorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nExample of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)There are mostly\ntwo UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic\nswaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one\npath. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent\nof the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An\nimplementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps\nsince it would live independently of the marketplace.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n(9:05 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545]) What does Lina consider to be the\nmost exciting aspect about Particl?\nParaphrased from Lina:\n\n> I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting\nthings I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is\nobviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get\nacquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the\nhype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while\nand they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to\npush good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the\ncryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other\nprojects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one\nof the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an\nactual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about\nrevolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in\nthis bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you\nfind yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering,\nand that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about\nthe project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!\n\nParaphrased from Paul:\n\n> Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing\nParticl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are\npretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working\nproduct, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are\nstill stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for\ntheir talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well\nreceived in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working\nblockchain product.\n(11:58 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718]) Can you give us a brief summary of\nyour week in South Africa?\nWe have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa\ndevelopment meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nAside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of\nthe meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be\nimproved.\n\nAmong the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy\nfor Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into\ntwo branches: dev and stable. The dev branch will be the “experimental” one\nwhere new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break\nstuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very\nhelpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a stable branch comes\nin handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been\nproperly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration\nand testing purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during\nAlpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time,\neach development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring\nmore frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring\nfor testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation,\nprivacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about\ndeveloping the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new\nfeatures, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to\nbe added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of\ndevelopment to be very exciting for everyone!\n\nWe’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also finally\nrelease Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet. We’re currently in the last mile\nbefore our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious\nmilestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the\ncurrent Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes\nlive on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha\nversion of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.\n\nAnother topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was\nour decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and\nboots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement\nwe’ve made in December that we’d be attending Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event,\nTOKEN2049.\n\nParticl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nDirectly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at\nmore conferences around the world…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\n\n(15:01 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901]) Is there going to be a meetup\nin France?\nYes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ \nCoinHouse [https://www.coinhouse.com/] late in February. CoinHouse is the\nleading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France\n[https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php] \nwith over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It\noffers a wide array of services including educational information, investment\nadvice\n[https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686] \n (approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part\nof their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very\npopular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by\nthe France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the\nnow widely-known and popular startup Ledger [http://ledger.com], which now have\na product (Ledger Nano S) that is compatible with Particl for hardware storage\nand cold staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\nCoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities HEC\n[http://www.hec.edu/] and Polytechnique [https://www.polytechnique.edu/] and now\noffers blockchain classes to students.\n\nLa Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nLeading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nmedium.com\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\n\nThis event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team\nmembers, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from\nMubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.\n\n(16:52 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012]) Will there be another\nPARTaker Hub?\nWe have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into\nseveral ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in\ntime, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term\ngoal.\n\n(17:44 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064]) Will there be a coin weight\nfeature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a\ncompetitor) from the market?\nIt shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of\ngovernance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing\nseveral rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release\nand part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial\ngovernance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against\nabuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring\nhow the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready\nto make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not\nthe first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is\na hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet\nmodel perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve\nas we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!\n\n(18:32 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112])— What added value could SCI\nprovide for Particl?\nSimilarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging\nthe founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project,\nmuch more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the\nproject, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year,\ntheir expertise and network could become very handy.\n\nSCI - Home [https://sci.ph/]\nSatoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology\ncompany\nbuilding the Blockchain ecosystem in… [https://sci.ph/]sci.ph [https://sci.ph/]\n\nSatoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies\nin the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well\nreputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even\nadvise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing\nlots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their\ninfluence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.\n\n> Other Questions\nWhat’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?\nThe biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX\ngenesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in\ntime. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that\ndecentralized exchange.\n\nWhat about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?\nWe’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social\njuggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will\nbegin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter,\nYouTube, and Instagram in 2019.\n\nBoth Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own\nsocial calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of\neach other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are\ncryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream\nonline buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary\nfeatures required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.\n\nWhat about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed\nand if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?\nLarge-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release\ncontaining all the planned features that define that release. It could even be\nlater than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to\nmore “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than\nBeta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to\nwork on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our\nadoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest\nassured, these are absolutely planned.\n\nFor this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in\nniche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or\ncertain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies.\nIn other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more\nlimited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering\nthe most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will\nbenefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee,\ncensorship-proof, privacy, etc).\n\nAs Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new\nfeatures that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added.\nWhether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation,\neach new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a\nwider audience.\n\nWe already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly\nbenefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the\nmarketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so\nthese will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be\nable to accommodate their businesses.\n\nDo we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the\nbeta be testnet or mainnet?\nWe don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the\nmainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before\nthe end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working\non a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the\nhardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can\nbe included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.\n\nRegarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to\nmake a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our\ntesters have been helping within the community since May. So instead of\nreleasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product\nour Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha\nversion will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and\nwill mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.\n\nAdditionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability,\nit will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable\ntestnet builds to everyone and have a select and limited group of users running\nthe mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to\neveryone!\n\nFollowing the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin\nworking on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace\nrelease — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move\nour Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.\n\nBeta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for\nMarch 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t\nconstitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up\nto that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will\nfeature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the\nteam was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on\npopping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting\nstage of development for the community than Alpha was.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nWhen and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?\nThe team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It\nis really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl\nFoundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round\nto those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with\nthe Foundation itself.\n\nHow much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and\nwhen can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?\nA mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input\nat this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have\nwhen we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current\ntasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the\nmarketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.\n\nInterview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nOn the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert\nEdwards. I’ve had the chance to have several…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\n\nOn a related note, Particl Copay has a new senior developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nbringing it up-to-date and adding more features, such as the ability to hold\nother coins on the wallet itself (i.e. Bitcoin). Another update to the mobile\nwallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS\nintegration (currently being looked into).\n\nAre you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?\nWe’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being\ndeveloped as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be\nattached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules\nwill be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release\nof a new roadmap for the moment.\n\nWhat kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target\nmainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?\nWithout a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target\nmainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot\nwon’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some\nusers will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new\nfeature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online\nshoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase\nof many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream\nusers and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe\ndecentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit\nalmost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized\nmarketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.\n\nIt is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless\nsolution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any\nthird-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on\nany partner.\n\nWhen is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?\nDesktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is\ncurrently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently\ncompatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later\ntime — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.\n\nWhat is your marketing plan for 2019?\nSimilar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl\nProject and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in\nslightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.\n\nWith the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not\nincrease our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We\nwill promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news\ndoesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep\nthe marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.\n\nTo that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and\nmeetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of\nthe only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an\neffective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the\nproject moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people\nthat were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that\nremain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in\nthe tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the\nworld. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we\nare working towards making these real-life connections.\n\nSimilarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off\nemployees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl\nthough, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope\nwill end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our\nproducts.\n\nNote that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.\n\nAre we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?\nThis is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s\nentirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART,\nbut we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to\nensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require.\nWe strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized\nas a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise\nand the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working\non something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it\ncurrently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an\nactual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the\nproject and the talent of our developers.\n\nWhat are the other Dapps planned for Particl?\nThe team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each\nperson has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a\nyet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the\nMarketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp\nitself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the\ndeveloper SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start\nseeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their\nown Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal\n“dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are\nsome thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus\nfor now if we want it to release in a timely manner.\n\nAbout Particl.page [http://Particl.page], what is this website, what are\ntheir goals?\nParticl Page [https://particl.page]\nCommunity is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise. We want to\nstimulate a nice, friendly community around… [https://particl.page]particl.page\n[https://particl.page]\n\nIt’s an awesome community run website! They now have made a cold staking pool\navailable for their users, but as the website isn’t run by the team itself, we\ncannot say what other plans they have. They are somewhat active on Riot so don’t\nbe shy asking questions directly to them! (Riot user: @particl.page:matrix.org)\n\nDo we have other partners ready to handle the volatility of the escrow, the\ndouble deposits and which will allow mainstream users to pay in fiat using\nparticl in the background except for Mubiz? If it is not the case what is going\nto be done to have a worldwide coverage of partners ready to give Particl access\nto mainstream users?\nNothing as of yet. This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with\neverything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the\nteam is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be\nsometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version\nof the marketplace is planned.\n\nDo you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their\ntrade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be\nmade to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and\nquantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been\nmade already?\nNo studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party\nregarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good\nstudy to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement\nand can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.\n\nI think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.\nWe’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and\n“Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private\nmarkets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large\nbubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the\nprivate markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll\nprobably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions.

They used this opportunity to record an AMA/FAQ session to answer some of the questions that have been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/a0lbbf/amafaq_with_special_guest_lina_seiche_recording/\"><strong>asked on Reddit.</strong></a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uiefPZl6IEw?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Due to limited time and the unusually high amount of questions received for this AMA/FAQ, the team couldn’t answer all the questions while in Toronto but did so in the Reddit thread itself. For the purpose of this Community Update, we’ve compiled all the answers, including those answered in the video.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Video Questions</strong></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"-3-01-can-we-expect-in-client-messaging-for-the-main-net\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=181\">3:01</a>) Can we expect in-client messaging for the main net?</h3><p>In-client messaging will be a new feature introduced into the marketplace as we work towards a fully loaded main release. We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Q&A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&amp;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications. This would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your day-to-day life.</p><h3 id=\"-3-49-will-there-be-a-decentralized-exchange-integration\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229\">3:49</a>) Will there be a Decentralized Exchange integration?</h3><p>The team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration at this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d keep the community in the know about any development on that front!</p><h3 id=\"-4-27-moving-forward-what-role-will-miguel-cuneta-and-john-bailon-play-in-particl\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284\">(4:27</a>) Moving forward, what role will Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?</h3><p>All of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl. Most of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own circles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It offers a wide array of services including educational information, <a href=\"https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686\"><strong>investment advice</strong></a><strong> </strong>(approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part of their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very popular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by the France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the now widely-known and popular startup <a href=\"http://ledger.com\"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, which now have a product (Ledger Nano S) that is <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>compatible with Particl for hardware storage and cold staking</strong></a>. CoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities <a href=\"http://www.hec.edu/\"><strong>HEC</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.polytechnique.edu/\"><strong>Polytechnique</strong></a><strong> </strong>and now offers blockchain classes to students.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><strong>La Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><em>Leading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\">medium.com</a></p><p>This event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team members, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from Mubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.</p><h3 id=\"-16-52-will-there-be-another-partaker-hub\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012\">16:52</a>) Will there be another PARTaker Hub?</h3><p>We have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines.

They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even advise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing lots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their influence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.</p><blockquote><strong>Other Questions</strong></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-s-happening-with-the-particl-pivx-alliance\"><em>What’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?</em></h3><p>The biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX genesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in time.

How will this evolve with mainnet?</em></h3><p>We’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social juggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It is really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl Foundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round to those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with the Foundation itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-much-time-will-be-needed-to-release-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-and-when-can-we-expect-a-particl-copay-wallet-on-ios\"><em>How much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and when can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?</em></h3><p>A mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input at this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Another update to the mobile wallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS integration (currently being looked into).</p><h3 id=\"are-you-going-to-release-a-roadmap-with-a-timeline\"><em>Are you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?</em></h3><p>We’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being developed as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise.

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace?

It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the developer SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to the whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and marketplace features on Particl.</p><hr><p>This concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Q&#x26;A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&#x26;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications.

A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform.

A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It offers a wide array of services including educational information, <a href=\"https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686\"><strong>investment advice</strong></a><strong> </strong>(approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part of their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very popular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by the France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the now widely-known and popular startup <a href=\"http://ledger.com\"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, which now have a product (Ledger Nano S) that is <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>compatible with Particl for hardware storage and cold staking</strong></a>. CoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities <a href=\"http://www.hec.edu/\"><strong>HEC</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.polytechnique.edu/\"><strong>Polytechnique</strong></a><strong> </strong>and now offers blockchain classes to students.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><strong>La Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><em>Leading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\">medium.com</a></p><p>This event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team members, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from Mubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.</p><h3 id=\"-16-52-will-there-be-another-partaker-hub\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012\">16:52</a>) Will there be another PARTaker Hub?</h3><p>We have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well reputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even advise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing lots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their influence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.</p><blockquote><strong>Other Questions</strong></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-s-happening-with-the-particl-pivx-alliance\"><em>What’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?</em></h3><p>The biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX genesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in time. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that decentralized exchange.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-social-media-strategy-how-will-this-evolve-with-mainnet\"><em>What about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?</em></h3><p>We’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social juggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It is really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl Foundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round to those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with the Foundation itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-much-time-will-be-needed-to-release-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-and-when-can-we-expect-a-particl-copay-wallet-on-ios\"><em>How much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and when can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?</em></h3><p>A mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input at this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Another update to the mobile wallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS integration (currently being looked into).</p><h3 id=\"are-you-going-to-release-a-roadmap-with-a-timeline\"><em>Are you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?</em></h3><p>We’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being developed as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise.

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be made to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and quantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been made already?</em></h3><p>No studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party regarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the developer SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to the whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and marketplace features on Particl.</p><hr><p>This concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

Of course, as there was a couple of presentations happening at the same time, the team did not get to see the entirety of the scheduled presentations, sometimes missing some due to networking outside of the rooms, but none of the ones we attended at live demos.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vfFNlVkVP_0?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"particl-in-the-philippines-manila-s-blockchain-christmas-fair\">Particl in the Philippines — Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair</h3><p><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\"><strong>14 Dec | Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair — BLOCKCHATS — Blockchain Events + Lifestyle</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\"><em>Browse the nerdiest Christmas fair of the year and grab merchandise, souvenirs, and your Christmas dinner from the…</em></a><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\">block-chats.com</a></p><p>On the 14th of December, Particl organized <a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/\"><strong>Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair</strong></a> alongside <a href=\"https://block-chats.com/\"><strong>Block-chats</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.coding-girls.com/\"><strong>Coding Girls Manila</strong></a>.

All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned.

The Particl Copay upgrades currently\nbeing worked on include multi-currency support (i.e. hold Bitcoin directly on\nParticl Copay), cold staking capabilities, iOS compatibility, and more.\n\nTo get to know Rob a bit better, don’t forget to read his interview published\non\nour blog\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nby following the link just above this section of the Community Update!\n\nParticl Core 0.17.1.0 Moves to Pre-Release Stage\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n\nTo get a strong start of the year, Tecnovert moved Particl Core 0.17.1.0 to its\npre-release stage, on mainnet. This means anyone can now download and install\nthis new Core update.\n\nIt’s important to note that, even though a lot of progress has been made on\n0.17.1.0 as it relates to the Trezor hardware wallet integration\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed], this\nupdate does not bring any new immediate feature or fix to Particl, and is being\npushed in the spirit of keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s at all\ntime.\n\nParticl’s Github Page Reaches 20,000 Commits\nOn December 12, Particl Core’s Github repository reached an interesting\nmilestone by registering it’s 20,000th commit (now standing at 20,185\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core])! This is both a testament to the\nteam’s relentless efforts at building the Particl platform and the benefits of\nkeeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s.\n\nParticl Ranks as the 11th Best Crypto Github Account of 2018\nAnother clear demonstration of what we mean when we say we’re out here to code\nand develop, not just hype and waste time, is the fact that Particl was ranked\nby CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] as the 11th best crypto Github project\nin 2018. CoinCodeCap is similar in nature to Darpal Rating\n[https://medium.com/dprating] (which unfortunately hasn’t put out any new Github\nranking for months) and ranks projects not based on price or marketcap, but by\nthe actual development being made to it.\n\nHere is how Particl ranked throughout the year in code rankings:\n\n * CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] (last 12 months) -> 21st\n * CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] (last 12 months) -> 11th\n * Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/dprating] (monthly) -> Constantly between\n   3rd and 7th, except for their last report where they oddly started taking\n   marketcap into consideration\n * Chinese KOL [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/962457662423273472] \n   (February 2018) -> 4th\n\nParticl’s Development Year in Review\nWe’ve just published an animation of all the work that’s been done over the year\non Github. Using the same open-source software we used for our Development\nTimeline blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513], we’ve\nfocused on the work done by the Particl team on all active Particl Github\nrepositories [http://github.com].\n\nIn the above video available on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg], developers with\ntheir names in green represent Particl team members while developers with their\nnames in white/grey are Bitcoin folks. Not only does this video proves that the\nParticl development team is relentless and very active, but also shows just how\nbeneficial keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin is.\n\nYes, it does look like Bitcoin developers are making commits to Particl Core,\nbut they’re really making commits to Bitcoin Core. The reason why they’re\nshowing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code\nis reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security,\nstability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly\nreflected on Particl Core. It’s like two teams working hand in hand!\n\nMubiz About to Release its New User Interface\n> \nFor those not aware of Mubiz, they are community members building a web\ninterface that will allow you to access Particl’s Open Marketplace directly from\nthe web as well as pay with more traditional means of payments than\ncryptocurrencies. Mubiz will also offer a wide array of services targeted to\nbuyers such as customer support, returns of products, reputation, shipping\nmanagement, escrow management (buyers won’t need to lock up extra funds), and\nmore. In other words, Mubiz seeks to make Particl’s Open Marketplace as easy to\nuse as any other traditional marketplace by building a service on top of the\nParticl protocol.\n\nMubiz announced this week that they will be releasing their new and improved\nuser interface tomorrow (Saturday the 5th of January 2019), and we are very\nexcited to see how it will look like!\n\nInfographics\nWe released two Open Marketplace infographics in December, if you missed those,\nhere they are!

All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards. To know all the benefits cold staking pools can bring you as well as the network, please read our blog post linked just below this paragraph.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3\"><strong>Cold Staking Pools — What You Need to Know</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3\"><em>Cold staking pools have been an item the community has been requesting for quite some time, and they are now available…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3\">particl.news</a></p><p>Very shortly after the release of the cold staking pool protocol, we were delighted to see three independently ran pools see the day.</p><ul><li><strong>Tecnovert’s Pool </strong><a href=\"http://66.172.10.231:903/\">http://66.172.10.231:903/</a></li><li><strong>Tecnovert’s Pool (Testnet)</strong> <a href=\"http://66.172.10.231:902/\">http://66.172.10.231:902/</a></li><li><strong>CryptoAcademie’s Pool</strong> <a href=\"http://167.179.93.172/\">http://167.179.93.172/</a></li><li><strong>Particl.Page’s Pool</strong> <a href=\"https://pool.particl.page/\">https://pool.particl.page/</a></li></ul><p>To get more technical information about cold staking pools as well as tutorials on how to connect to an existing pool or create one of your own, please read our dedicated Wiki pages linked below:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical information:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/pools\">https://particl.wiki/pools</a></li><li><strong>Join an existing pool:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_connect\">https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_connect</a></li><li><strong>Create your own pool:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_create\">https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_create</a></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKlmD9Fz-dg?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"interview-with-robert-edwards\">Interview With Robert Edwards</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

The reason why they’re showing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code is reflected whenever we update our codebase.

I’ve had the\nchance to have several back and forths with him, and have asked him a few\nquestions to let you all know a bit more about our new fellow Particl family\nmember! You can follow him on the following platforms:\n\nGithub: https://github.com/spazzymoto\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-edwards-82464992/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCould you give a small resume of your professional journey?\n> After school, I’ve started working for a company that does process\ninstrumentation. I was mainly coding front ends that interfaced with the\ndevices. I worked there for around 2 years and then took my “gap year” where I\nwent sailing in the med and the carribean for about 2 years.When I got back to\nSouth Africa, I was chatting to Ryno who told me to come for an interview at the\ncompany he was currently working at, which did financial based software. I got\nthe job there and that is where I spent my last 9 years.\n\nSo where did you meet Ryno initially?\n> I met Ryno years ago, I went to a house party with some friends when we were\nstill in school. Turns out it was at Ryno’s house. We’ve been friends since\nthen.\nWhere does the Spazzymoto username come from?\n> Growing up, I did a lot of sailing with my dad and I think he came up with\nSpazzymoto as the name for one of our boats. I latched on to it as it’s a\nusername no one else uses that I’ve seen, so it makes registering at new\nwebsites really easy.\nHas Particl been your introduction to blockchain development?\n> It has been. I did a course or two at my old company to see how we could\npotentially use blockchain, but these were very high-level overviews.\nWere you personally involved/interested in some way in cryptocurrencies before\nParticl then?\n> Besides owning some cryptocurrencies and following a few, mainly Particl & Nano,\nI wasn’t really involved although it is an area that has always interested me. I\nthink it has massive potential and I can’t wait to see what’s to come.\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenge for cryptocurrencies’ mainstream (or\nwider) adoption?\n> I think the biggest problems I see, in my opinion, are:1) I could explain to my\nparents how to buy Particl, for example. I think massive improvements have been\nmade to make this process easier, but I think we as a community can do better!\n2) I think another issue is convincing people to actually use their crypto on\nthe marketplace instead of just “hodling”. I guess no one wants to spend today\nwhat could be worth a lot more in the future. I think this will get better as\nthe crypto prices stabilize though.\n\nHow did you get to join Particl?\n> After 9 years at my previous company, I felt like Iwas in a bit of a rut/comfort\nzone, that I wasn’t really challenging myself anymore. I therefore took the\nplunge and registered on a South African tech job site to see what was out there\nand if there were any jobs were I felt that I could challenge myself. Low and\nbehold, Ryno found me there and the rest is history as they say.\nWhat makes you the most excited about Particl?\n> I think Particl’s vision, it has a great team of people guiding and working on\nit. I think the marketplace is a great example of the dedication of this team to\ndrive innovation in the crypto space.\nWhat is your fresh/outside perspective on Particl?\n> The thing I love most about Particl compared to, say Bitcoin, is that I see it\nas a green cryptocurrency. The amount of energy being consumed to mine bitcoin\nis outrageous. That, and I feel like Particl consistently pushes the boundaries,\nI can’t wait for the marketplace to hit mainnet.\nDo you plan on personally use it? What would you like to sell or buy the most?\n> I am definitely going to use it, I will have to go see what I can sell, although\nI’m not really sure I’d have anything to sell at this point, but you never know!\nAs for buying, anything that means one less trip to a shopping center! I hate\nshopping centers.\nWhat is your specific role in Particl Desktop? In other words, what is a typical\nday for you working for Particl.\n> My role is to turn coffee into code! I think compared to my previous job, I get\nto actually code a lot more as opposed to all the design & estimation meetings\nthat I was used to. I am new to the project, but I’m hoping I can dig in and\nhelp share the load with the rest of the guys.\nWhat item or part of Particl will you be working on? I’ve heard you were going\nto start on Copay. What updates are you making to it?\n> My first task has been to update the Particl Copay app to the latest version\nfrom Bitpay. This was quite a few commits behind and required some updates to\nthe supporting bitcore wallet service and supporting libraries.Following updates\nwill be: An iOS version, notifications, support for Particl, but also Bitcoin &\nBitcoin Cash wallets, and cold staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDue to the team’s almost exclusive focus on marketplace development as of late,\nthe Particl Copay mobile app had been put on the backburner for some time. It’s\ndefinitely going to be refreshing to see all these updates take place for\nParticl’s mobile app, especially the long-awaited iOS version and cold staking\nfeatures.

There is a very simple reason behind it: it’s one of the first\ntime people can actually gain full control over their own money and transact\nwith anyone in the world without requiring the assistance or oversight of any\nthird-party or authority figure. In other words, Bitcoin gives us, the people,\nfinancial and economic freedom like never before.\n\nAs great as it sounds, Bitcoin is still unfortunately pretty dependent on\ncentralized infrastructure, and thus, is having a hard time realizing its\nvision. When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what\ndo you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat\ncurrencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an\neCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service\ncompany that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf.\nThat is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating\nthrough all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized.\nNot only does this practice goes against everything Bitcoin was created for,\nnamely the vision of a new economy, one that is independent of centralized\nauthorities and third-parties, but it also makes Bitcoin’s adoption as a\ncurrency a dud.\n\nSo how do we fix that problem? How can we fill the gap to adoption and place the\nfinal piece of the puzzle, so to speak? How can we get to the point where we\nwon’t have to exit crypto anymore because spending Bitcoin and other coins will\nbe easier than switching back to the old global fiat economy?\n\nBitcoin’s Missing Piece to its Grand Puzzle\nBitcoin is almost everything a currency should be, but there appears to be\nsomething missing for a true crypto-based economy to flourish and thrive. Of\ncourse, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and\nwithout intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult\nto find within all the noise. Because most people value convenience so much,\nthey would rather spend more money and “exit” the crypto ecosystem rather than\ngoing through the hassle of finding these vendors.\n\nThe end result is that, as it stands today, Bitcoin is used for mostly three\nthings: trading/speculation, remittance payments, and store of value. It is\ncertainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is\ncertain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services\nis, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat\ncurrencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people\noutside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main\nreasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.\n\nWhen we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to\nfirst recognize the challenges we still face to this day. Without Bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies being at least as easily, affordably, and conveniently\nspendable as traditional currencies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is likely to\nremain stuck within its own bubble. The path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\n> The path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the\nindependent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized\ninfrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\nWith the Bitcoin cryptocurrency ecosystem and community quickly growing within\nthe last few years, it seems the final roadblock in the path to mainstream\nadoption and the realization of crypto as a truly independent economy is the\nability to be able to easily spend coins without third-party and have it be as\nconvenient and affordable as it would be when spending traditional currencies\nwithin the global fiat economy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Day Has Come for Crypto to Claim its Independence\nUp until now, and even after all these years, there hasn’t been any clear\nsolution to the issue of not being able to spend Bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies with the same freedom and convenience you can transact them.\nMany companies and websites have tried to claim they were allowing people to\neasily spend their coins, but in the end, it always required you to trust that\nentity and pay fees on top of it. Far from ideal!\n\nThere is, however, a project presenting itself as a solid and completely\ntrustless solution to the now decade-old coin spending problem, and could very\nwell help Bitcoin’s adoption as an actual currency. Let’s dive right into what\nmakes this project such a good candidate to be that missing piece of the\nBitcoin’s puzzle.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace\nBuilt on the most recent Bitcoin codebase, Particl’s Open Marketplace is a\ndecentralized, fully trustless marketplace specifically designed to work with\nyour favorite cryptocurrency. Imagine a platform similar to eBay, but with no\nintermediary whatsoever, the possibility to use your favorite coin (including\nBitcoin), built with privacy at its core, and with barely any fee. All the good\nstuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!\n\nThe absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace\nto run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The\nbuilt-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin\ncodebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that no party,\nsuch as a platform operator or payment processor, can access your personal\ninformation. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping\naddress to the vendors you’re buying products from.\n\nBuilt on the Bitcoin Codebase\nParticl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has\nall the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin,\nincluding a default integration of Segwit, Lightning Network\n[http://lightning.network]-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of\nthe Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is\nnamed Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that Particl is not an ICO, not an\nEthereum-token, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control\nover its ecosystem. The blockchain was launched in a very fair way years ago and\nis developed by a team of mostly Bitcoin fanatics [http://particl.io/about-us] \nthat have been working in crypto for quite some time and have made names for\nthemselves. Particl’s Github page [http://github.com/particl] is one of the most\nactive one in the entire blockchain industry, and the amount of work being done\non it is tremendous, especially in comparison to other cryptocurrency projects,\nalways ranking in among the top coins in Darpal’s Github Audit Reports\n[https://medium.com/@DPRating].\n\nUse Your Favorite Coin\nStraying away from the counter-productive “tribalism” currently plaguing the\ncrypto industry, Particl Open Marketplace’s underlying protocol is designed to\nwork with your favorite cryptocurrency. While initial versions of the\nmarketplace might only work with PART to begin with, it has been coded in such a\nway that integrating almost any coin to its platform is made trivial. Of course,\nBitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.\n\nTribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when\nfighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed\nby the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, \nParticl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate\nin favor of its native currency. Forcing users to use a native currency is a\nmistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly\nunappealing to most people. Particl’s Open Marketplace is designed to benefit\nthe entire crypto ecosystem and add utility to all coins!\n\nPrivate-by-Design\nUsing some of the latest privacy technologies in the industry, the Open\nMarketplace is private-by-design, meaning that all purchases and sales made from\nwithin its platform are private by default, regardless of the coin used to make\nthe purchase.\n\nIn fact, Particl has been the first project to integrate RingCT, the privacy\nprotocol made popular by Monero, on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase\nother than Cryptonote, for that matter). Moreover, the entire platform is built\nwith privacy at its core, meaning no data can ever leak out of the platform or\nbe recorded in a publicly auditable fashion on the blockchain, protecting its\nusers from abusive data analysis and industry copycats. Content is stripped of\nall its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is\ndesigned to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable.\nAdditionally, you can start your own private market (currently called “bubbles”)\nand make products available only to those who you send the access key to, making\nthe entire process even more private and completely away from the eyes of\ncompetitors.\n\nRidiculously Low Fees\nParticl’s Initial Fee Schedule (Will Decrease Over Time)What would be the use of\nsuch a marketplace if fees were high? The whole point of this article was to, in\npart, point out how expensive shopping with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\ncan get because you are forced to use third-parties which, among the many\ndisadvantages they cause, charge users with fees that make spending coins not a\ncost-effective activity. For the crypto economy to really become a viable\noption, fees need to be kept at a minimum, which is exactly the case on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\nWhile Particl is already very low on fees at this current moment in time, it\nwill ultimately reach its vision and be fully integrated with both scalable and\nentirely trustless solutions which will make it a near-zero fee platform.\nProtocols such as atomic swaps\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp] (already live on mainnet\nsince October 2017), Lightning Network [http://lightning.network], Segwit, and\nothers will make using Particl extremely affordable and as convenient and fast\nas traditional eCommerce platforms.\n\nGenerally speaking, charging vendors with barely any fee, especially when they\nare used to be being abused by traditional platforms, means they will be able to\neither make more profit-per-sale or lower their prices to gain an advantage over\ntheir competitors and get bigger sales volume. The end result for the customer\nis likely to be more affordable products than anywhere else on the web. Fees on\ntraditional eCommerce platforms are outrageous, the new crypto economy is a fair\none that is centered around its users, not the platform’s operator!\n\nNo Intermediary At All\nNo, you are not dreaming. All of this is indeed available without the use of any\nthird-party or central authority whatsoever. Every feature available on the Open\nMarketplace comes from 100% trustless protocols. For example, atomic swaps is\nthe protocol used to enable you to use your favorite coin. The escrow is managed\nthrough a mechanism using a smart-contract and security deposits and is based on\nthe MAD game-theory. The governance (or moderation) of the marketplace’s content\nis entirely controlled by the community.\n\nThere is absolutely no intermediary on Particl, just like there is no\nintermediary involved when transacting Bitcoin from person-to-person. In other\nwords, everything that Bitcoin has which made its cryptocurrency great, Particl\noffers the same but to the eCommerce industry. No intermediary means anything\nyou do within the platform is perfectly secure and untraceable, that your data\nisn’t collected or shared with anyone, and that the platform can be used at a\nbare minimal cost.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, the path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\nEarn Cryptocurrencies While You Sleep\nAnother important aspect of an “economy” is to be able to earn transferable\nvalue (currency) directly within it. This is precisely what Particl makes\npossible.\n\nIn fact, not only can you sell products and services online to earn\ncryptocurrencies without requiring any intermediary, but you also receive the\nentirety of the fees generated by the Particl platform as a coin holder. This\naspect of the platform constitutes a great source of passive income and is\nexpected to get exponentially profitable as the marketplace sees more sales\nvolume per day. This passive income mechanism also applies to all future paid\n(but optional) features of the marketplace such as featured listing spots, for\nexample.\n\nThe Power of Community\nWith Particl’s Open Marketplace, you can expect convenience like never seen\nbefore when looking for vendors that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nBecause Particl presents itself as a common ground for both vendors and buyers,\nit makes it very easy to find the product or service you are looking for or to\nget the exposure you deserve as a vendor accepting crypto. Looking for\nsomething? Just type what you wish to purchase in the search bar, and be exposed\nto a multitude of vendors selling what you need. Selling stuff? Just list your\nproducts on the Open Marketplace and instantly get the exposure you deserve in\nfront of the right target audience. Gone are the days spent digging through\nsearch engines and advertising your business on obscure cryptocurrency forums,\nthe world is now at your fingertips and is available at minimum effort!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Building Blocks of the New Economy\nBitcoin and Particl’s Open Marketplace are entirely complementary and made to\nlive side-by-side. If we were to compare the new, independent economy made\npossible by Bitcoin and Particl to a house, Bitcoin would be its cornerstone (or\nits foundation) while Particl would the support beams. Bitcoin is what started\nit all (the cornerstone), but without its support beams, the house would not be\nable to stand ground for much longer, let alone withstand severe storms of FUD\nand speculation-led bear markets.\n\nBe Part of the Solution\nThe mainnet release of Particl Open Marketplace is rapidly approaching, and the\ndays where Bitcoin was stuck within its own bubble caused by the inconvenience\nof spending coins are now coming to an end. With a super convenient, affordable,\neye-candy, and trustless solution to spend coins about to see the day, now is\nthe time to get involved!\n\nParticl Open Marketplace is currently undergoing heavy testing on public testnet\nand is nearing its Beta release, and we need you now more than ever! Come to\njoin our community, connect with other pioneers of the new, independent economy,\nand spread the word around. We now stand at the forefront of one of the biggest\nfinancial revolution to ever see the day: the birth of the first truly global\nand independent economy powered by Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-LejDfDLZGzsWcTxixmLHzA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Bitcoin is often considered the most important technological breakthrough since the internet.

All the good stuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!</p><p>The absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace to run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The built-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin codebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that <strong>no party</strong>, such as a platform operator or payment processor, <strong>can access your personal information</strong>. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping address to the vendors you’re buying products from.</p><h3 id=\"built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\"><strong>Built on the Bitcoin Codebase</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-t2vpHIAhhHL09kj6CLmGjg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has all the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin, including a default integration of Segwit, <a href=\"http://lightning.network\"><strong>Lightning Network</strong></a>-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of the Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is named Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).</p><p>It is important to note, however, that Particl is <strong>not an ICO</strong>, <strong>not an Ethereum-token</strong>, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control over its ecosystem.

Of course, Bitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.</p><p>Tribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when fighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed by the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, <strong>Particl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate in favor of its native currency</strong>. Forcing users to use a native currency is a mistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly unappealing to most people.

Content is stripped of all its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is designed to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable.

All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins\nand still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but\nsmaller, staking rewards.\n\nCold Staking Pools\ntecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\nPooled coldstaking demo. Contribute to tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]github.com\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\n\nThe reason Particl’s staking pools are called cold staking pools is that they\noperate in the same way cold staking does. Cold staking allows you to delegate\nyour staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf,\nbut without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows\nyou to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to\nyour coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked,\nalthough not obligatory).\n\nIn that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that\nallows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your\ncoins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is\nimportant because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t\nactually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is\nactually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight\npossessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. Cold staking\npools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!\n\nNote: You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a\nLedger Nano S hardware device. This will make your funds impossible to steal\neven when unlocking your wallet from an infected or compromised computer. To\nlearn more about this, read the “The Ultimate Vulnerability” section of this\nblog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]. To\nlearn how to connect your funds stored on a Ledger Nano S hardware device to a\nstaking pool, follow the instructions in this tutorial\n[https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac] \nand, instead of using a cold staking node public key, use the public key given\nto you by the cold staking pool.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Are Cold Staking Pools Going to Benefit the Particl Network?\nIn short, it’s going to make staking much more accessible and practical to\neveryone, regardless of the number of coins you hold or your level of expertise.\n\nStaking With Fewer Coins\nIn fact, staking with only a small PART balance is not ideal because of the size\nof each staking reward (~1.25 PART at the time of this writing). To put that in\nperspective, consider the moment 1 PART was worth around $50. If you wanted to\nbuy $1,000 worth of Particl, that would have given you around 20 PART. Back\nthen, the staking interest rate was 5%. This meant that, after one full year of\nstaking, you would have earned around 1 PART staking on the network, a yearly\nreward that is smaller than the payout size. In other words, chances are high\nthat you wouldn’t even have received a single reward during the entire year even\nthough you helped secure the network the whole time. This phenomenon is not\nunlike “solo mining” with a poor GPU on Proof-of-Work networks.\n\nNow, with cold staking pools, you could “team up” with the other stakers\nconnected to the same pool as you and get a share of the staking rewards earned\nby the pool proportional to how much you’ve contributed to it. Instead of\nwaiting a long time to receive one large staking reward, you would receive\nsmaller but more frequent rewards. This makes staking much more interesting and\ninteractive, and also makes staking with fewer coins more stable and reliable.\n\nEasier to Set Up for Non-Technical Users\nAnother obstacle to cold staking is the technical level required to set up a\ncold staking node. Although not overly complicated, especially when following \nthe cold staking node setup tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4], it\ndoes require time and effort to correctly execute. It also generally requires\nthe use of a staking device like a Raspberry Pi or a VPS server, all of which\nadds up to the difficulty and hassle of setting cold staking up.\n\nOn top of that, staking devices need to be maintained quite regularly: you need\nto make sure it is up 24/7, you need to ideally keep it updated to the latest\nParticl Core version (especially when there are hardforks), and you need to make\nsure it is properly restarted when, for example, there is a power outage or\nsomething that makes the electricity go off.\n\nFor a lot of users, especially the less technical ones, the dedication it takes\nto set cold staking up and maintain its device is simply too much. Cold staking\npools, on the other hand, do not require you to prepare and manage a staking\nnode since that part is taken care of by the pool operator. Enabling cold\nstaking has never been as easy as with cold staking pools, and it shouldn’t take\nmore than 2 minutes off of your time!\n\nMore Coins Being Staked\nBecause of how much it would benefit some types of users, cold staking pools are\nlikely to encourage more people to stake their coins. This will benefit the\nnetwork by having fewer available coins on the markets, meaning it would be much\nharder for an attacker to acquire large sums of PART coins and try to damage the\nnetwork with a 51% attack. In Proof-of-Stake networks, more coins being put up\nfor staking means it is more secure.\n\nNote: Staking pools do present a risk to the network if misused. In fact, while\nthey make 51% attacks harder to execute by reducing the number of coins\navailable on the markets, they could also potentially end up staking 51% of the\ntotal network supply if users are not careful enough. As such, we encourage as\nmany people within the community to come up with their own cold staking pools\n(the source code is openly available here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]) in order to create many\ndifferent options for users which would lead to a better decentralization of the\nstaking supply.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts\n * You can still vote on Community Proposals and flag listings while your funds\n   are connected to a cold staking pool.\n * The pool operator cannot vote on your behalf, nor can he flag listings using\n   your coin weight.\n * Records can be obtained to verify the pool’s operator integrity.\n * Payout threshold (the total amount of PART you need to accumulate within the\n   pool before a payout is executed) is set up by the pool operator and can be\n   changed at any time.\n * In the future, pools might be able to read specially formatted control\n   transactions, meaning smart-contracts could potentially interact with them.\n * In the future, research might be done to integrate the Lightning Network to\n   cold staking pools, which would allow an almost infinite number of\n   micro-payouts per day (i.e. multiple payouts throughout the day of 0.01\n   PART).

All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-pools\">Cold Staking Pools</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><strong>tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><em>Pooled coldstaking demo.

Cold staking allows you to delegate your staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf, but without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows you to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to your coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked, although not obligatory).</p><p>In that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that allows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your coins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is important because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t actually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is actually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight possessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. <strong>Cold staking pools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!</strong></p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake protocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a Ledger Nano S hardware device.

It presented itself as a great\nopportunity for the team members to meet the co-workers they’ve been working\nwith for some time (and in some cases, years), as well as being the perfect\nopportunity to get as many heads working together and brainstorming as possible.\n\nThere’s one thing that is absolutely sure and that definitely stands up the\nminute these meetings start: the level of expertise, knowledge, and passion\nwithin the team is simply out of this world! On their own, each of the team\nmembers is quite impressive in terms of skills. When they get together, however,\nthat’s when the magic happens.\n\nGetting Particl Marketplace Beta Ready\nThe meetings were, for the most part, exclusively focused on the development and\nmanagement of the project with a particular look on the short to mid-term.\n\nThe development team first focused on what needed to be done more urgently in\nregards to the finalization of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. Suffice\nto say, we are definitely getting to the very end of the Alpha stage of\ndevelopment and only minor tweaks and additions (notably linked to software\nstability and governance) are still left to add. While that is not necessarily\nfresh news, it does confirm that we might only be weeks away from the release of\nthe long-awaited Beta version of the marketplace, on testnet first of course.\n\nIt was also discussed that Particl Marketplace Beta might release initially as a\nLite Beta, then followed by more frequent than now Release Candidates, each of\nthem adding a new feature not present in the previous version. For example, it\nis very likely that the very first Release Candidate of Particl Marketplace Beta\nmight not contain RingCT/CT privacy features integrated into the escrow system\nas Tecnovert is still working on improving the RingCT protocol with\nprivacy-enhancing tweaks as well as Bulletproofs.\n\nIt was also heavily considered by the team that Particl Marketplace Beta, once\nstable enough and properly tested, might hit mainnet before Particl Marketplace\n1.0 is fully completed. The timeline of the mainnet release is of course not\navailable as a lot of it depends on moving targets and at how fast the platform\ncan be made stable enough to use with real money. This early mainnet period will\nbe extremely useful to test the dynamics of the many decentralized mechanisms in\nplace within the platform such as MAD escrow, anti-spam measures, governance,\nand etc.\n\nPost-Beta Items\nAnother very important task of this series of meetings was to draw an internal\nroadmap of development tasks and decide on what is going to be worked on after \nthe release of the Beta version of the marketplace. One of the decisions the\ndevelopers took was to now mostly focus on one feature at a time instead of\nworking on many at once. This will definitely help in releasing new features\nwith each Release Candidates and publish them in shorter timeframes as they are\nright now.\n\nDISCLAIMER: What follows is a list of items the development team will most\nlikely be working on after the initial release of Particl Marketplace Beta.\nItems are placed in no particular order and there is no public timeline \navailable for these. As with everything development-related, some of these items\nmay be abandoned and new ones might start being worked before others, and thus\nnone of what follows can be interpreted as “promises”. The purpose of this list\nis only to give you a general idea of what the team currently has in mind.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarketplace-Related\n> IPFS: IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System, and is a decentralized data\nstorage network\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \n(DSN). Particl Marketplace will use IPFS to store messages and data, which is\nexpected to reduce listing fees as well as increase the quality of the uploaded\ndata (i.e. listing pictures in higher quality).Note that, while IPFS will make\nit more affordable to use the marketplace, it does not provide the user with the\nsame level of privacy as SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html],\nParticl’s current default DSN. This is why the marketplace will likely default\nwith IPFS and allow to manually change the default DSN in the Settings page.\nFollow the link below to get more information about IPFS.\n\nWhat is IPFS? [https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\nIPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. At its core it is a versioned file\nsystem which can store files and track…\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]medium.com\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\n\n> Reputation System: Many of you will be happy to see this item. Vendor reputation\nis an almost necessary information for buyers when shopping online and has been\nrequested by a lot of you from the community. While the exact implementation and\nmechanism still remain unsettled for the moment, this is one of the items that\nwill eventually make its way onto Particl Marketplace.Payment Gateways: As a\ncore aspect of our vision, Particl Marketplace is designed to be a marketplace\nwhere many different cryptocurrencies are accepted. Thus, a gateway, initially\none for Bitcoin-only, will be integrated on Particl Marketplace. The initial\nintegration might probably be a third-party integration, but as proper\ndecentralized solutions rise up, expect the team to keep a close eye on them and\nwork towards integrating solutions aligned with our own vision.\nPrice Pegging: Important for a smooth user experience as well as mainstream\nadoption, price pegging is the ability to price an item according to the\ncurrency of your choice. It means a vendor could decide, for example, to sell an\nitem for $150 USD, and that item would still remain listed at $150 regardless of\nthe PART coin price fluctuation. Price pegging will also make it possible for\npeople to display posted listings in the currency of their choice.\nVendor/Buyer Communication: The ability to message the other party in a \nmutually\nassured destruction [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction] \nscenario, the game-theory scenario on which Particl Marketplace’s MAD escrow is\ndesigned), is tricky.\nOn one hand, it is necessary for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate\nbetween each other. On the other hand, it needs to be done in a way that reduces\nthe risk of the vendor blackmailing the buyer to a minimum. Ultimately, if there\nis no way for involved parties to communicate within the platform, it is simply\ngoing to be taken off-platform.\nThis is why the team has decided to craft a special communication system where\nblackmailing possibilities will be reduced to a minimum. We will give more\ndetails about the messaging system once we are getting closer to its release\nMessaging System: While not exclusive to the marketplace, the messaging system\nwill also be available, in full, but without buyer/vendor relationship. This\nwill render possible individual and group chats directly from within Particl\nDesktop, a feature that will make secure messaging as easy and effortless as\nwriting a normal message on any other application. This messaging system will be\nparticularly useful for Particl Bubble members (people possessing the Market ID\nof private/community markets) to really bond together and foster sub-communities\nwithin the marketplace itself.\nFiat Payment Gateways: Fiat payment gateways are integrations that allow users\nto pay for items on Particl Marketplace using more traditional means of payments\nsuch as a credit card. It’s important to note that, for convenience and legal\nreasons, this particular item may never make its way onto Particl Marketplace at\nany point in time. While this is an item that is being seriously considered and\nactively researched by the team, a payment solution would need to be compatible\nwith our own vision and not require the user to go through numerous tedious\nsteps in order to be integrated into Particl Desktop.\nEscrow Refunds & Recovery: One way Particl’s MAD escrow can become problematic\nis if one of the two parties isn’t able to access the smart-contract anymore,\nthus making it impossible to retrieve any funds or complete a transaction. This\nis why the team will be focused on building a refund and recovery option for the\nescrow system in order to make it more secure and resilient to unforeseen\nproblems.\nCode refactoring: As Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring] \nputs it, “code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer\ncode — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior.”. This\nrefactoring process, already underway, will make Particl Marketplace much faster\nand smoother to use. This aims at giving the marketplace the same level of\nresponsiveness you would expect from web-based platforms.\nTranslations: Not exclusive to the marketplace, translations will eventually\nmake their way onto Particl Desktop. It will then be possible for you to\nregister on the Particl translation team and contribute on making Particl\nDesktop available in your favourite language using Transifex\n[https://www.transifex.com/].\nShipping Carrier Integration: A possible, yet not guaranteed, integration the\nteam has been wanting to have is for shipping carrier information to be able to\nbe tracked directly from within the marketplace itself. In other words, this\nintegration would allow you to track your orders without having to leave\nParticl. Another good step towards convenience!\nFollow a Vendor: This self-explanatory feature will allow you the follow your\nfavorite vendors on the marketplace. The exact implementation hasn’t been\ndecided on, but it is likely that, for privacy reasons, it will be an opt-in\noption for vendors to allow their customers to follow them around.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore-Related\n> Latest Bitcoin Codebase: As always, we are committed to keeping the Particl\ncodebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s. This allows the project to benefit from all\nthe breakthroughs made to the Bitcoin codebase, some of which being directly\nincluded into this list.RingCT Improvements: As stated for a few weeks now, our\nLead Cryptographer & Core Developer, Tecnovert, has been making a few tweaks on\nthe RingCT protocol. These tweaks are specifically intended to make the RingCT\nprotocol more private than it currently is on other coins’ implementations.\nBecause of the nature of these tweaks, we cannot reveal any detail at this\nmoment as to keep the exclusivity on the improvements.\nBulletproofs: The Bulletproofs protocol improvement allows RingCT transactions\nto be dramatically reduced in size, making them cheaper to send as well as more\nlightweight on the blockchain. This will greatly help the Particl blockchain to\nstay as scalable and fast to sync as possible over a long period of time.\nLightning Network: The Lightning Network allows transactions to be sent at a\nnear-instant speed and at near-zero cost. The implementation of this protocol is\nexpected to be one of the main areas of focus for Tecnovert this year. It will\nhelp with the execution of atomic swaps, the scalability of the network, as well\nas potentially be made available with private transactions.\nSidechains: Another area of interest for 2019, as mentioned by Tecnovert, is the\nresearch and development of side-chain solutions for Particl. As defined by \nHackerNoon [https://hackernoon.com/what-are-sidechains-1c45ea2daf3], a “\nsidechain is a separate blockchain\n[https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-versus-traditional-databases-c1a728159f79] \nthat is attached to its parent blockchain using a two-way peg”. No additional\ninformation concerning sidechains on Particl is publicly available yet, so stay\non alert for more information about this in 2019!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, the South Africa team meeting has been super productive and have\nreally helped pave the way for the next few months to be impactful for the\nproject. With new developers, like Rob, jumping on board, it can only be\nexpected that the development pace is going to keep increasing as time goes. The\nteam is now really well organized with development managers and agile\nmethodologies which makes Particl’s future really look bright.\n\nP.S.: Don’t miss our blog post early next week where we will reveal a big\nconference Particl will be attending next year with a booth, a presence that was\nconcretized while we were in South Africa!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-T3ZHDBgILfKJxfTO7-ZiYg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-uvoqDP5zna4QKYLJgBLUog.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in <strong>South Africa</strong> from the <strong>16th of November to the 24th</strong> for a series of important development meetings that would shape the short to mid-term path forward for the project.</p><p>Contrary to previous meetings held in Prague and Switzerland where mostly the core group met, this one was planned to gather most of the developers as well as some members of the communications team together.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWhen is the RingCT and governance hardfork is going to happen?\nThere is no official date set for it yet, and the plan to combine RingCT and\ngovernance into the same hardfork hasn’t changed since we last spoke about it.\nTecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability,\nperformance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on\nmainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and\nso it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.\n\nDoes the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when\nthey are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and\ncan’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?\nIn short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a\ngood idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins\nand then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency.\nThis isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or\nimplemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus\nis mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note\nthat we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test,\nresearching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry,\nmeaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest\npriority.\n\nOne interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl\nMarketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and\nrequires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually\nlock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers\nneed to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’\nhonesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked.\nContrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply\nlocked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive,\nas everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a\nperfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up\nfor an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to\nbe more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future,\nmore Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock\neven more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed\nSDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire\nlarge sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior\nis akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).\n\nLooking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any\ndocumentation or internal chats?\nNo, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except\nfor Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately\n(as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of\nCharlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages.\nLike any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some\nmisbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead\ndeciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty\nconclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made\nagainst him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his\nbrand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.\n\nWill Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges\nlike Binance?\nIt seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community\nand chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to\ntimes regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this\nmay not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general\nthat this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are\nactually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s\nhappening surrounding the project.\n\nRight now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance,\nbut also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large\nexchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing\nfee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community\ngrowth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund\nmanagement strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds\nfor development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional\nfunding round will be in sight).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nStatus Report\nParticl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nAs always, a new Status Report was published at the same time we did our last\nlivestream. This report indicates a couple of items to be completed, such as \nuniformed height of listing items, drag’n’drop capability added when adding\nlistings, and proposals/votes to be based on time instead of blocks. Newly added\nto the In Development section are the governance system coin weight system, \nprivate markets, and proposal enhancements. As always, Tecnovert is still\nworking on improving the RingCT implementation with enhancements and \nBulletproofs. The current team meeting in South Africa is likely to shape future\nStatus Report and further the internal roadmap.\n\nConferences & Meetups\n> \nAs we have been saying lately, our intention is to start getting a more direct\nexposure by directly reaching out to the most passionate individuals of the\ncrypto scene by getting a better exposure at various crypto events. Nothing\nbeats the human interaction of discussing in-person the subject we are all\npassionate about!\n\n> \nOur newest team member, Lina Seiche, was specifically hired with this in mind\nand has already started integrating Particl into the blockchain presentations\nshe had already scheduled. Because she is seemingly falling in love with\nParticl, and also because of her own company, block-chats\n[https://block-chats.com/], it is to be expected that Particl will now be\nintegrated into most of their events, in some way or the other, in addition to\nthe Particl-themed events she’ll be organizing.\n\nAs such, she’s started planning the first of many future Particl-themed events.\nIn fact, on the 14th of December, Particl is going to hold its first official\nevent in Manilla, Philippines. This Christmas-themed Particl event will not only\nfocus on Particl but will also hold a panel of experts and well-known blockchain\npublic figures in that region. The panel will focus on eCommerce and why it is\nin dire need of decentralization and will be composed of leaders in the\nPhilippines blockchain industry such as:\n\n * Miguel Cuneta — Co-Founder of SCI [https://sci.ph/] & Particl Advisor\n * Mark Vernon — Founder of TagCash [https://tagcash.com/], a large\n   Philippines-based crypto company and very well-known within the Asian\n   community\n * Chris Verceles — Blockchain developer at Consensys [https://consensys.net/]\n * Colin Goltra — Head of Cryptocurrency Program at Coin.ph [https://coins.ph/]\n * Gerb Inajada — Head of Blockchain Technology at UnionBank\n   [https://www.unionbank.com/]\n * Alenna Dawn Magpantay — Philippines Ambassador for Coding Girls\n   [https://www.coding-girls.com/]\n\nFor more information about this event, please follow these links: \nhttps://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/ & \nhttps://www.meetup.com/BlockChatsPhilippines/events/256492831/\n\nWe’ve also have been reaching out to our key contacts within the French\ncommunity and are planning a meetup/conference in Paris shortly. We will give\nmore information about this one at a future time.\n\nParticl Chosen to Present at the Toronto CryptoCamp Blockchain Unconference\nHome [https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\nToronto | 29.11.18 Crypto camp Get your tickets!\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]www.cryptocamp.community\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\n\nParticl has been chosen among 80 applications to present its Particl Marketplace\nproduct at the Blockchain Unconference in Toronto on the 29th of November.\n\n> CryptoCamp is Toronto’s first-ever blockchain unconference. This\n100%-volunteer-led event aims to bring the entire blockchain community together,\nshowcase some of the most interesting products and projects, and pay it forward\nby offering Blockchain Bootcamp workshops. Organized by the community for the\ncommunity, CryptoCamp aims to grow, connect, and diversify the ecosystem. Come\nto meet other crypto-curious and crypto-scaredies, and connect with\nprofessionals working in this space. This event is for you.\nThis conference is mainly focused on two things: education, and the presentation\nof actual products making use of the blockchain technology. This event will be\nhosted at the Deloitte Office in Toronto and will take place over two entire\nfloors.\n\nThe first part of the day will be dedicated to education. In fact, many speakers\nwill give educational talks about crypto and blockchain technology in general to\na wide audience of crypto enthusiasts. The second part of the day, which is when\nwe are scheduled to present Particl Marketplace to the crowd, is focused on\nshowcasing actual blockchain products. In fact, a series of speakers will each\nbe demonstrating their blockchain products in front of experts in the field and\nexplain how they foresee it making an impact on the industry they’re each\ntargeting. With around 80 submitted applications or so, the event has chosen\nParticl as one of the projects it wants to see presented!\n\nTickets for the entire event are available at this link\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-camp-at-deloitte-tickets-51716842468#tickets]\n, and we hope to have the chance to meet some of you who live close to Toronto.\nThis event is organized in part by CryptoChicks, a rather well-known blockchain\ngroup in Canada, and has partnered with several key sponsors such as Deloitte,\nShyft, BlockGeeks, TWG, and many more to make it a memorable moment. If you’re\naround the area and would like to come, let us know in advance so that we can\nmeet up at some point!\n\nSee the full list of speakers here: https://www.cryptocamp.community/speakers/\n\nDevelopment Team Meeting in South Africa\nThe team is currently meeting near Elizabeth Port in South Africa for its\nquarterly meeting. This time, instead of solely focusing on development\nstrategy, the team has also invited most of the communications team to join the\nmeeting and further develop the marketplace launch strategy and communications\nstrategy moving forward. Topics to be discussed include the coming release of\nParticl Marketplace, the coming funding round, the internal development roadmap,\nand many other topics. We will keep you updated as we go, of course!\n\nAdditional Links\nBitcoinAfrica.io Interview with Desi-Rae\n[https://bitcoinafrica.io/2018/11/07/interview-cryptoramble-particl-project/]\n\nNodesOfValue Interview with CryptoBeans\n[https://nodesofvalue.com/particl-passive-income-from-staking-and-decentralized-market-listing-fees/]\n\nNew Desi-Rae Video:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe wish you all a good week and don’t forget to follow our particl.news\n[http://particl.news] page to not miss any update and #BePART of our great \nDiscord [https://discord.gg/CQNZDN] community!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--11/1-VEFKKynh55H3sZAgvQbcFQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Did you miss our last AMA/FAQ livestream on Youtube?

Tecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability, performance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on mainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and so it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.</p><h3 id=\"does-the-particl-team-plans-on-integrating-a-lock-up-time-for-part-coins-when-they-are-unlocked-for-staking-so-that-coins-are-locked-for-a-longer-time-and-can-t-be-moved-staked-sold-before-your-node-finds-a-block\">Does the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when they are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and can’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?</h3><p>In short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a good idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins and then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake protocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency. This isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or implemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus is mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note that we have a Research &#x26; Development team constantly putting up to test, researching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry, meaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest priority.</p><p>One interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl Marketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and requires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually lock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).</p><h3 id=\"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats\">Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?</h3><p>No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of Charlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages. Like any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some misbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead deciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty conclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made against him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his brand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-hire-a-market-maker-and-make-deals-with-bigger-exchanges-like-binance\">Will Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges like Binance?</h3><p>It seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community and chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to times regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this may not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general that this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are actually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s happening surrounding the project.</p><p>Right now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance, but also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large exchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing fee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community growth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund management strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds for development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional funding round will be in sight).</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"status-report\">Status Report</h3><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications</strong></a><br><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><em>Particl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy * Private…</em></a><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p>As always, a new <strong>Status Report</strong> was published at the same time we did our last livestream.

Newly added to the <em>In Development</em> section are the governance system <strong>coin weight system,</strong> <strong>private markets</strong>, and <strong>proposal enhancements</strong>. As always, Tecnovert is still working on improving the RingCT implementation with <strong>enhancements</strong> and <strong>Bulletproofs</strong>.

Don’t worry, this update should keep you up to speed with all\nthe latest developments and news surrounding the project!\n\nYou also don’t want to miss the News & Updates part of this Community Update as\nwe’ll reveal some details about Particl’s new team member, Lina!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nNote: This edition of the AMA/FAQ livestream features Arnold Bansemer as a\nguest. Some of the answers to the questions included in this summary have been\nparaphrased and shortened to fit with the Community Update format. Please refer\nto the provided timestamps for the exact answer from Arnold himself!\n\n(2:34 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=154]) Arnold Bansemer Introduces Himself\n“I’ve taken over from Kewde as Lead Developer for Particl Desktop, however, I\nstill refer back to him from time to time as he’s been a huge part of building\nParticl Desktop, so he’s not entirely relieved from its “duty”. What I mostly do\nis code reviews, manage merge and pull requests as well as help other developers\nwhen they have difficulties or issues with some specific tasks. I also have my\nown development workload, of course.”\n\n(3:56 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=236]) Are you only working on Particl\nDesktop or do you also work on the marketplace?\n“If my help is required, I’ll always be there to assist the marketplace\ndevelopers. As a matter of fact, I’ve already submitted some PRs (pull requests)\nabout it, although I am still finding my way myself through the marketplace\ncode. In fact, there’s a lot of code done on Particl Marketplace! The\nMarketplace Team is also very strong and experienced and I don’t think I’m\nneeded that much to assist them, but if there is a need I’ll be there!”\n\n(6:20 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=380]) Is there any update on the cold\nstaking pool?\nThe cold staking pools are more or less ready to be released. If you are already\non the #testing channel on Riot or Discord, you can see Tecnovert has already\nmade the code publicly available. Not only has the code been made available, but\ntesting as well. In fact, in the #testing channel were posted instructions on\nhow to test the staking pool on both testnet and mainnet networks. The more\ntesters we get, the quicker we can identify and fix issues and get it officially\nreleased.\n\nSneak peek of the cold staking pool’s user interfaceIt’s important to note that\nthe publicly available staking pools do not have any GUI interface and are very\nbarebone. While the GUI has been under development for some time now, it will\nonly be available on the official launch day of the staking pools.\n\nThe code itself is not hosted under Particl’s Github account, just like\nDasource’s Partyman cold staking app. The code for the cold staking pools is\nhosted under Tecnovert’s personal account here: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool. We encourage everyone to\ntest, study, tweak, or fork the code if they want to.\n\nKeep an eye out for any update about cold staking pools in the coming weeks!\n\n(10:21 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=621]) Arnold, what’s your fresh\nperspective of the project?\n“One thing that particularly stood out when I first joined the Particl project\nis the passion, dedication, and technical skills of the team members. I can even\nsay that at first, I was a little bit intimidated by that as everyone really is\non top of their game, I was wondering how I would measure up to them. There is\nso much that has been accomplished code wise and it’s pretty impressive. I can\nsay this is what really stood out for me as a new team member.”\n\n(12:41 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=760]) What do you think the project is\n“behind”?\n“As far as what we are behind with…well we are always “generally behind” when it\ncomes to any project development. It’s a bit difficult to put into perspective\nbecause there’s a lot of work to be done, but we’re also moving as fast as we\ncan given the size of the team. I don’t see, however, any particular aspect of\nthe project that is specifically behind other aspects or being neglected. We’re\nstill on track to wrap up governance this month, and probably get Beta ready for\nthe next month or so. One thing we gotta be careful about though is to finish\nwhat we start working on first before implementing new features/functions, or\nelse it becomes hard to finish things up properly. I think we’ve been pretty\ngood on that end though.”\n\n(14:50 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=884]) As a new team member, did you\nfeel welcome?\n“Yes, but it’s a bit different than what I am used to. I come from the more\ntraditional 9 to 5 job model where you work in an office and have a set\nschedule. Usually, during your first day at the office, you are directly\nintroduced to everyone you’ll be working with and so it is easy to get to know\nyour new co-workers quickly.\n\nParticl being a decentralized team, it’s a bit different. You kind of have to\nmake the first steps because everyone is so busy and caught up in their work.\nThere’s also the fact that most conversations happen over text in chat, so it’s\nnot as easy to get to know your new co-workers as an in-office job. But yes, I\ndid feel welcome, and so far most team members have been willing to sacrifice\nsome of their time to chat a little and get to me know better!”\n\n(17:14 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1034]) Are you going to the South Africa\ntrimestrial team meeting?\n“Yes, I’ll be there! I actually live in South Africa so it won’t be difficult\nfor me to get where the meetings are. I’ll surely be taking part in some of the\ndeveloper meetings and will be there to finally meet the rest of the team in\nperson! This will definitely be beneficial to get together, in person, to flesh\nout ideas in a more direct way than over chats or conference calls!”\n\n(19:40) What would you say to others who may want to join the development? Would\nyou recommend it?\n“I can’t comment on what the Foundation does and who they hire, but I definitely\nrecommend participating from a community contribution perspective. Do it,\nplease, it’s important and helps a lot! This is a community project and\ncontributions are welcomed in more than one way. If you’ve got an idea for a\nfeature or just a general proposal, then, by all means, log it on Github or code\nit up then submit a pull request. I’ll definitely review it for integration and\nit might just make it if the review is positive. We’ll never say no to\ncontributions, especially as we have a small team. There’s only so much we can\ndo at a given time. Right now, we’re really busy with the marketplace code. If\nthere’s something that’s not within our immediate focus, you can contribute and\nwe will look into each submission for sure!”\n\n(22:19 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1339]) What’s your opinion on the few\nbugs identified on the latest Particl Marketplace Alpha builds?\n“A couple of them are easy fixes and have already fixed in internal builds.\nThere have been, however, one or two bugs that have been trickier in fixing,\nnotably due to reproduction issues (recreating the bug internally) and figuring\nout how they’re happening. We’re making good progress on them though, especially\non the [object Object] issue lots of people have been having.\n\nIn most cases, the fixes are pretty simple, it’s more about figuring about how\nthe bugs are generated and not breaking anything else while fixing them. That's\npretty much what automated test cases are for, and I think we need to have more\nof them. It’s one of the goals we’re all currently working towards at the same\ntime as shown in the status report. Also, as mentioned before, more community\ntesters definitely helps to identify and troubleshoot these issues.”\n\n(25:22 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1522]) Will you guys put new testnet\nbuilds out now that the download links have expired?\n“What we’re trying to avoid with the 10-day expiry limit on download links is\nthe number of available bugs out there. We don’t want people using old builds\nand reporting bugs and issues that have already been fixed in new releases.\nThere’s also a second aspect to it in that we ideally want to include new stuff\nfor the community to test everytime we do new releases to keep it interesting to\nthe community to keep the number of testers high! There should be a new testnet\nbuild coming out soon so keep an eye on the #testing channel!”\n\n(28:07 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1687]) You mentioned in your interview\nwith Cryptoguard that you were excited about future use-cases, features, and\nDapps for Particl. Do you have any idea on top of your head you can share?\n“I’ve actually been discussing with Cryptoguard in private chats the other day\nideas we and other people from the community and team have had over time.\nThere’s a couple of them floating around, but currently, the main focus really\nis about getting the marketplace up and we need to push that hard. We’re\nhesitant to mention anything specific at the moment because we don’t want to\nswitch the focus on other stuff.\n\nWhat really excites me in that regard though is that there are many ideas out\nthere that would be possible to implement. Getting ideas from the community is\nwhat we need to go forward, and is a great mental exercise to identify what we\nneed to focus on next after the marketplace. For the moment, I won’t elaborate\ntoo much and keep that for after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace!”\n\n(30:44 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1844]) What are your thoughts on the\npotential of the coming developer SDK? How do you see Particl as a decentralized\nand privacy-focused economy rather than just a currency?\n“That’s extremely important to have that baseline of privacy, and then\neverything built on top of that is beneficial. Getting the community involved as\nwell, in the long run, is going to really push the project forward and will\nprobably be the driver for mass adoption. There’s already going to be the\nmarketplace available, but taking it beyond that is really going to transform\nthe GUI (Particl Desktop) into essentially a platform with a similar approach to\na plugin-based platform architecture. Whether future Dapps and features are\ndeveloped by us or by the community…I really believe this is going to be the\ndriving force for mass adoption!”\n\n(33:30 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2010]) Has Particl been your introduction\nto blockchain development?\n“My very very first introduction to cryptocurrencies was back in 2011–2012 when\nI first heard about it. I didn’t really know about it at the time and kind of\npushed it to the side to see what would happen before I do anything about it.\nThen, one of the companies I was working with started to look into crypto and\nthat’s when I really could evaluate what was happening in the space. That’s\naround the time I first bought Bitcoin as well as some other coins. But strictly\nrelated to actual development, yes, Particl is my first crypto project as a\ndeveloper.”\n\n(36:07 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2167]) What’s your favorite topping on\na pizza?\n“I’m born carnivorous, so any kind of meat is welcomed on pizza, especially\nbacon! Also, I’m in the more controversial side of the debate…but pineapple can\ndefinitely work on a pizza.”\n\n(39:01 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2341]) Paul, Does Particl plans on\ncreating a two-token system to reduce the volatility of funds held in escrow?\n“There’s no immediate plan for this. That being said, that doesn’t it won’t ever\nhappen, but as Arnold said, it’s important to focus on one thing at a thing and\nnot spread ourselves too thin, otherwise, lots of stuff get started but few of\nthem actually get finished up. We are actually going to consider various\nsolutions to reduce volatility and a two-token system might be part of the\nsolution, but it’s not part of the current roadmap.”\n\n(41:46) Will the official website be updated in time for the mainnet release of\nthe marketplace?\n“Yes, the website is constantly in evolution since we launched Particl. We’re\nalso in contact with HackerBay, a German-based company focused on communication\nand marketing, among other things, to help improve the way our message is being\ncommunicated.\n\nWe are currently working on a page specifically made for the marketplace and\nwill update the rest of the website accordingly.”\n\n—\n\nIf you want to read more questions and answers from Arnold, please head over to\nthe link below and read Cryptoguard’s interview with him!\n\nInterview with Arnold Bansemer, Particl Desktop’s Lead Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\nBack in August, the Particl team was very excited to welcome Arnold Bansemer as\nthe new Particl Desktop Lead Developer…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Team Member Joins the Rank\nLast weekend, we’ve teased pictures of a mystery woman hanging out with Miguel\nCuneta [https://twitter.com/MiguelCuneta/status/1056727461990289409], CCO and\nCo-Founder at Satoshi Citadel Industries and Particl advisor. Now’s the time to\nreveal a bit more about Lina, Particl’s newest team member!\n\n> Originally from Germany, Lina is a former\nYoutube-singer-turned-blockchain-advocate — with a few stations in\nbetween.Scouted online by a Japanese artist, she made the move to Asia to\nundergo extensive studies in music, language, and business administration,\neventually turning to the latter to become chief manager at a Kuala Lumpur-based\nmanagement company. Her entrance into the blockchain industry came through her\nposition as the PR Manager and Evangelist for a Tokyo-founded cryptocurrency\nhedge fund platform where she would break down language barriers launching\nglobal roadshows and marketing activities.\n\nHer extensive experience in PR management and event organization is going to\nhelp the project a lot. Particl will also benefit from her skills as a public\nspeaker, writer, event organizer, and much more. We are already bouncing many\nevent ideas and, with Lina, you can expect Particl to start gaining more “boots\non the ground” exposure at conferences and meetups all around the world!\n\nLina will introduce herself to the community next week with a video, you\ndefinitely want to keep your eyes open for that!\n\nStatus Report Updated\nParticl.io — StatusReport [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl is an open source, decentralized privacy platform. Built for global\nperson to person and business to person… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nWhile the team is currently mostly busy working on finalizing the governance\nsystem with coin weights, building the private markets, and fixing the various\nissues identified by community testers of the last Particl Marketplace Alpha\nbuild, an interesting item has popped up in the newest Status Report: the\nability to view a list of reported items to cast a vote. This feature will allow\nusers to quickly access listings that have previously been flagged by other\nusers and either vote them as undesirable or not undesirable. This should\nincrease the number of votes cast, thus making the reporting more accurate.\n\nzDEX Alpha is Live With Particl\nzDEX, a privacy-focused decentralized exchange using PIVX’s second-tier network,\nhas launched its Alpha (testnet) version with Particl as one of its 6 first\ncoins to be made available. Make sure to visit zDEX’s website\n[http://www.zdex.exchange/] and test this promising exchange!\n\nSupply lock up\nIn the last few weeks, there have been interesting discussions on Discord and\nTelegram as to how Particl’s MAD escrow system is going to reduce the\ncirculating supply of the PART coin.\n\nIn fact, as the escrow system generally requires the buyer to pay for an item,\nmake a security deposit equal to the value of the purchased order, and have the\nvendor also make an equal-value security deposit, it can be estimated that, in\naverage, three times the value of an item is locked in escrow for a certain\nduration (until both parties agree the transaction is done).\n\nIf we are to estimate that an escrow could take on average 14 days to complete\n(the time it takes to process, package, ship, and receive an order), then it is\npossible to estimate the total amount of money, in PART, locked out of\ncirculation at any given time.\n\nTo not miss any of these interesting discussions, join our of our chatrooms on\neither Discord, Telegram, or Riot.

Some of the answers to the questions included in this summary have been paraphrased and shortened to fit with the Community Update format. Please refer to the provided timestamps for the exact answer from Arnold himself!</em></p><h3 id=\"-2-34-arnold-bansemer-introduces-himself\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=154\">2:34</a>) Arnold Bansemer Introduces Himself</h3><p><em>“I’ve taken over from Kewde as Lead Developer for Particl Desktop, however, I still refer back to him from time to time as he’s been a huge part of building Particl Desktop, so he’s not entirely relieved from its “duty”. What I mostly do is code reviews, manage merge and pull requests as well as help other developers when they have difficulties or issues with some specific tasks. I also have my own development workload, of course.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-3-56-are-you-only-working-on-particl-desktop-or-do-you-also-work-on-the-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=236\">3:56</a>) Are you only working on Particl Desktop or do you also work on the marketplace?</h3><p><em>“If my help is required, I’ll always be there to assist the marketplace developers. As a matter of fact, I’ve already submitted some PRs (pull requests) about it, although I am still finding my way myself through the marketplace code. In fact, there’s a lot of code done on Particl Marketplace! The Marketplace Team is also very strong and experienced and I don’t think I’m needed that much to assist them, but if there is a need I’ll be there!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-6-20-is-there-any-update-on-the-cold-staking-pool\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=380\">6:20</a>) Is there any update on the cold staking pool?</h3><p>The cold staking pools are more or less ready to be released. If you are already on the #testing channel on Riot or Discord, you can see Tecnovert has already made the code publicly available. Not only has the code been made available, but testing as well. In fact, in the #testing channel were posted instructions on how to test the staking pool on both testnet and mainnet networks. The more testers we get, the quicker we can identify and fix issues and get it officially released.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--10/1-BDFGHiGI011S8LRa8LmIQQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Sneak peek of the cold staking pool’s user interface</figcaption></figure><p>It’s important to note that the publicly available staking pools do not have any GUI interface and are very barebone. While the GUI has been under development for some time now, it will only be available on the official launch day of the staking pools.</p><p>The code itself is not hosted under Particl’s Github account, just like Dasource’s Partyman cold staking app. The code for the cold staking pools is hosted under Tecnovert’s personal account here: <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><strong>https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We encourage everyone to test, study, tweak, or fork the code if they want to.</p><p>Keep an eye out for any update about cold staking pools in the coming weeks!</p><h3 id=\"-10-21-arnold-what-s-your-fresh-perspective-of-the-project\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=621\">10:21</a>) Arnold, what’s your fresh perspective of the project?</h3><p><em>“One thing that particularly stood out when I first joined the Particl project is the passion, dedication, and technical skills of the team members. I can even say that at first, I was a little bit intimidated by that as everyone really is on top of their game, I was wondering how I would measure up to them. There is so much that has been accomplished code wise and it’s pretty impressive. I can say this is what really stood out for me as a new team member.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-12-41-what-do-you-think-the-project-is-behind-\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=760\">12:41</a>) What do you think the project is “behind”?</h3><p><em>“As far as what we are behind with…well we are always “generally behind” when it comes to any project development. It’s a bit difficult to put into perspective because there’s a lot of work to be done, but we’re also moving as fast as we can given the size of the team. I don’t see, however, any particular aspect of the project that is specifically behind other aspects or being neglected. We’re still on track to wrap up governance this month, and probably get Beta ready for the next month or so. One thing we gotta be careful about though is to finish what we start working on first before implementing new features/functions, or else it becomes hard to finish things up properly. I think we’ve been pretty good on that end though.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-14-50-as-a-new-team-member-did-you-feel-welcome\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=884\">14:50</a>) As a new team member, did you feel welcome?</h3><p><em>“Yes, but it’s a bit different than what I am used to. I come from the more traditional 9 to 5 job model where you work in an office and have a set schedule. Usually, during your first day at the office, you are directly introduced to everyone you’ll be working with and so it is easy to get to know your new co-workers quickly.</em></p><p><em>Particl being a decentralized team, it’s a bit different. You kind of have to make the first steps because everyone is so busy and caught up in their work. There’s also the fact that most conversations happen over text in chat, so it’s not as easy to get to know your new co-workers as an in-office job. But yes, I did feel welcome, and so far most team members have been willing to sacrifice some of their time to chat a little and get to me know better!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-17-14-are-you-going-to-the-south-africa-trimestrial-team-meeting\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1034\">17:14</a>) Are you going to the South Africa trimestrial team meeting?</h3><p><em>“Yes, I’ll be there! I actually live in South Africa so it won’t be difficult for me to get where the meetings are. I’ll surely be taking part in some of the developer meetings and will be there to finally meet the rest of the team in person! This will definitely be beneficial to get together, in person, to flesh out ideas in a more direct way than over chats or conference calls!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-19-40-what-would-you-say-to-others-who-may-want-to-join-the-development-would-you-recommend-it\">(19:40) What would you say to others who may want to join the development? Would you recommend it?</h3><p><em>“I can’t comment on what the Foundation does and who they hire, but I definitely recommend participating from a community contribution perspective. Do it, please, it’s important and helps a lot! This is a community project and contributions are welcomed in more than one way. If you’ve got an idea for a feature or just a general proposal, then, by all means, log it on Github or code it up then submit a pull request. I’ll definitely review it for integration and it might just make it if the review is positive. We’ll never say no to contributions, especially as we have a small team. There’s only so much we can do at a given time. Right now, we’re really busy with the marketplace code. If there’s something that’s not within our immediate focus, you can contribute and we will look into each submission for sure!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-22-19-what-s-your-opinion-on-the-few-bugs-identified-on-the-latest-particl-marketplace-alpha-builds\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1339\">22:19</a>) What’s your opinion on the few bugs identified on the latest Particl Marketplace Alpha builds?</h3><p><em>“A couple of them are easy fixes and have already fixed in internal builds. There have been, however, one or two bugs that have been trickier in fixing, notably due to reproduction issues (recreating the bug internally) and figuring out how they’re happening. We’re making good progress on them though, especially on the [object Object] issue lots of people have been having.</em></p><p><em>In most cases, the fixes are pretty simple, it’s more about figuring about how the bugs are generated and not breaking anything else while fixing them. That's pretty much what automated test cases are for, and I think we need to have more of them. It’s one of the goals we’re all currently working towards at the same time as shown in the status report. Also, as mentioned before, more community testers definitely helps to identify and troubleshoot these issues.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-25-22-will-you-guys-put-new-testnet-builds-out-now-that-the-download-links-have-expired\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1522\">25:22</a>) Will you guys put new testnet builds out now that the download links have expired?</h3><p><em>“What we’re trying to avoid with the 10-day expiry limit on download links is the number of available bugs out there. We don’t want people using old builds and reporting bugs and issues that have already been fixed in new releases. There’s also a second aspect to it in that we ideally want to include new stuff for the community to test everytime we do new releases to keep it interesting to the community to keep the number of testers high! There should be a new testnet build coming out soon so keep an eye on the #testing channel!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-28-07-you-mentioned-in-your-interview-with-cryptoguard-that-you-were-excited-about-future-use-cases-features-and-dapps-for-particl-do-you-have-any-idea-on-top-of-your-head-you-can-share\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1687\">28:07</a>) You mentioned in your interview with Cryptoguard that you were excited about future use-cases, features, and Dapps for Particl. Do you have any idea on top of your head you can share?</h3><p><em>“I’ve actually been discussing with Cryptoguard in private chats the other day ideas we and other people from the community and team have had over time. There’s a couple of them floating around, but currently, the main focus really is about getting the marketplace up and we need to push that hard. We’re hesitant to mention anything specific at the moment because we don’t want to switch the focus on other stuff.</em></p><p><em>What really excites me in that regard though is that there are many ideas out there that would be possible to implement. Getting ideas from the community is what we need to go forward, and is a great mental exercise to identify what we need to focus on next after the marketplace. For the moment, I won’t elaborate too much and keep that for after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-30-44-what-are-your-thoughts-on-the-potential-of-the-coming-developer-sdk-how-do-you-see-particl-as-a-decentralized-and-privacy-focused-economy-rather-than-just-a-currency\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1844\">30:44</a>) What are your thoughts on the potential of the coming developer SDK? How do you see Particl as a decentralized and privacy-focused economy rather than just a currency?</h3><p><em>“That’s extremely important to have that baseline of privacy, and then everything built on top of that is beneficial. Getting the community involved as well, in the long run, is going to really push the project forward and will probably be the driver for mass adoption. There’s already going to be the marketplace available, but taking it beyond that is really going to transform the GUI (Particl Desktop) into essentially a platform with a similar approach to a plugin-based platform architecture. Whether future Dapps and features are developed by us or by the community…I really believe this is going to be the driving force for mass adoption!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-33-30-has-particl-been-your-introduction-to-blockchain-development\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2010\">33:30</a>) Has Particl been your introduction to blockchain development?</h3><p><em>“My very very first introduction to cryptocurrencies was back in 2011–2012 when I first heard about it. I didn’t really know about it at the time and kind of pushed it to the side to see what would happen before I do anything about it. Then, one of the companies I was working with started to look into crypto and that’s when I really could evaluate what was happening in the space. That’s around the time I first bought Bitcoin as well as some other coins. But strictly related to actual development, yes, Particl is my first crypto project as a developer.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-36-07-what-s-your-favorite-topping-on-a-pizza\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2167\">36:07</a>) What’s your favorite topping on a pizza?</h3><p><em>“I’m born carnivorous, so any kind of meat is welcomed on pizza, especially bacon! Also, I’m in the more controversial side of the debate…but pineapple can definitely work on a pizza.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-39-01-paul-does-particl-plans-on-creating-a-two-token-system-to-reduce-the-volatility-of-funds-held-in-escrow\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2341\">39:01</a>) Paul, Does Particl plans on creating a two-token system to reduce the volatility of funds held in escrow?</h3><p><em>“There’s no immediate plan for this. That being said, that doesn’t it won’t ever happen, but as Arnold said, it’s important to focus on one thing at a thing and not spread ourselves too thin, otherwise, lots of stuff get started but few of them actually get finished up. We are actually going to consider various solutions to reduce volatility and a two-token system might be part of the solution, but it’s not part of the current roadmap.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-41-46-will-the-official-website-be-updated-in-time-for-the-mainnet-release-of-the-marketplace\">(41:46) Will the official website be updated in time for the mainnet release of the marketplace?</h3><p><em>“Yes, the website is constantly in evolution since we launched Particl. We’re also in contact with HackerBay, a German-based company focused on communication and marketing, among other things, to help improve the way our message is being communicated.</em></p><p><em>We are currently working on a page specifically made for the marketplace and will update the rest of the website accordingly.”</em></p><p>—</p><p>If you want to read more questions and answers from Arnold, please head over to the link below and read Cryptoguard’s interview with him!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826\"><strong>Interview with Arnold Bansemer, Particl Desktop’s Lead Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826\"><em>Back in August, the Particl team was very excited to welcome Arnold Bansemer as the new Particl Desktop Lead Developer…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826\">particl.news</a></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-team-member-joins-the-rank\">New Team Member Joins the Rank</h3><p>Last weekend, we’ve teased <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiguelCuneta/status/1056727461990289409\"><strong>pictures of a mystery woman hanging out with Miguel Cuneta</strong></a>, CCO and Co-Founder at Satoshi Citadel Industries and Particl advisor.

The more testers we get, the quicker we can identify and fix issues and get it officially released.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--10/1-BDFGHiGI011S8LRa8LmIQQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Sneak peek of the cold staking pool’s user interface</figcaption></figure><p>It’s important to note that the publicly available staking pools do not have any GUI interface and are very barebone.

I can even say that at first, I was a little bit intimidated by that as everyone really is on top of their game, I was wondering how I would measure up to them. There is so much that has been accomplished code wise and it’s pretty impressive. I can say this is what really stood out for me as a new team member.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-12-41-what-do-you-think-the-project-is-behind-\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=760\">12:41</a>) What do you think the project is “behind”?</h3><p><em>“As far as what we are behind with…well we are always “generally behind” when it comes to any project development. It’s a bit difficult to put into perspective because there’s a lot of work to be done, but we’re also moving as fast as we can given the size of the team. I don’t see, however, any particular aspect of the project that is specifically behind other aspects or being neglected. We’re still on track to wrap up governance this month, and probably get Beta ready for the next month or so. One thing we gotta be careful about though is to finish what we start working on first before implementing new features/functions, or else it becomes hard to finish things up properly. I think we’ve been pretty good on that end though.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-14-50-as-a-new-team-member-did-you-feel-welcome\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=884\">14:50</a>) As a new team member, did you feel welcome?</h3><p><em>“Yes, but it’s a bit different than what I am used to. I come from the more traditional 9 to 5 job model where you work in an office and have a set schedule. Usually, during your first day at the office, you are directly introduced to everyone you’ll be working with and so it is easy to get to know your new co-workers quickly.</em></p><p><em>Particl being a decentralized team, it’s a bit different. You kind of have to make the first steps because everyone is so busy and caught up in their work. There’s also the fact that most conversations happen over text in chat, so it’s not as easy to get to know your new co-workers as an in-office job. But yes, I did feel welcome, and so far most team members have been willing to sacrifice some of their time to chat a little and get to me know better!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-17-14-are-you-going-to-the-south-africa-trimestrial-team-meeting\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1034\">17:14</a>) Are you going to the South Africa trimestrial team meeting?</h3><p><em>“Yes, I’ll be there! I actually live in South Africa so it won’t be difficult for me to get where the meetings are. I’ll surely be taking part in some of the developer meetings and will be there to finally meet the rest of the team in person! This will definitely be beneficial to get together, in person, to flesh out ideas in a more direct way than over chats or conference calls!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-19-40-what-would-you-say-to-others-who-may-want-to-join-the-development-would-you-recommend-it\">(19:40) What would you say to others who may want to join the development? Would you recommend it?</h3><p><em>“I can’t comment on what the Foundation does and who they hire, but I definitely recommend participating from a community contribution perspective. Do it, please, it’s important and helps a lot! This is a community project and contributions are welcomed in more than one way. If you’ve got an idea for a feature or just a general proposal, then, by all means, log it on Github or code it up then submit a pull request. I’ll definitely review it for integration and it might just make it if the review is positive. We’ll never say no to contributions, especially as we have a small team. There’s only so much we can do at a given time. Right now, we’re really busy with the marketplace code. If there’s something that’s not within our immediate focus, you can contribute and we will look into each submission for sure!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-22-19-what-s-your-opinion-on-the-few-bugs-identified-on-the-latest-particl-marketplace-alpha-builds\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1339\">22:19</a>) What’s your opinion on the few bugs identified on the latest Particl Marketplace Alpha builds?</h3><p><em>“A couple of them are easy fixes and have already fixed in internal builds. There have been, however, one or two bugs that have been trickier in fixing, notably due to reproduction issues (recreating the bug internally) and figuring out how they’re happening. We’re making good progress on them though, especially on the [object Object] issue lots of people have been having.</em></p><p><em>In most cases, the fixes are pretty simple, it’s more about figuring about how the bugs are generated and not breaking anything else while fixing them. That's pretty much what automated test cases are for, and I think we need to have more of them. It’s one of the goals we’re all currently working towards at the same time as shown in the status report. Also, as mentioned before, more community testers definitely helps to identify and troubleshoot these issues.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-25-22-will-you-guys-put-new-testnet-builds-out-now-that-the-download-links-have-expired\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1522\">25:22</a>) Will you guys put new testnet builds out now that the download links have expired?</h3><p><em>“What we’re trying to avoid with the 10-day expiry limit on download links is the number of available bugs out there. We don’t want people using old builds and reporting bugs and issues that have already been fixed in new releases. There’s also a second aspect to it in that we ideally want to include new stuff for the community to test everytime we do new releases to keep it interesting to the community to keep the number of testers high! There should be a new testnet build coming out soon so keep an eye on the #testing channel!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-28-07-you-mentioned-in-your-interview-with-cryptoguard-that-you-were-excited-about-future-use-cases-features-and-dapps-for-particl-do-you-have-any-idea-on-top-of-your-head-you-can-share\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1687\">28:07</a>) You mentioned in your interview with Cryptoguard that you were excited about future use-cases, features, and Dapps for Particl. Do you have any idea on top of your head you can share?</h3><p><em>“I’ve actually been discussing with Cryptoguard in private chats the other day ideas we and other people from the community and team have had over time. There’s a couple of them floating around, but currently, the main focus really is about getting the marketplace up and we need to push that hard. We’re hesitant to mention anything specific at the moment because we don’t want to switch the focus on other stuff.</em></p><p><em>What really excites me in that regard though is that there are many ideas out there that would be possible to implement. Getting ideas from the community is what we need to go forward, and is a great mental exercise to identify what we need to focus on next after the marketplace. For the moment, I won’t elaborate too much and keep that for after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-30-44-what-are-your-thoughts-on-the-potential-of-the-coming-developer-sdk-how-do-you-see-particl-as-a-decentralized-and-privacy-focused-economy-rather-than-just-a-currency\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1844\">30:44</a>) What are your thoughts on the potential of the coming developer SDK? How do you see Particl as a decentralized and privacy-focused economy rather than just a currency?</h3><p><em>“That’s extremely important to have that baseline of privacy, and then everything built on top of that is beneficial. Getting the community involved as well, in the long run, is going to really push the project forward and will probably be the driver for mass adoption. There’s already going to be the marketplace available, but taking it beyond that is really going to transform the GUI (Particl Desktop) into essentially a platform with a similar approach to a plugin-based platform architecture. Whether future Dapps and features are developed by us or by the community…I really believe this is going to be the driving force for mass adoption!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-33-30-has-particl-been-your-introduction-to-blockchain-development\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2010\">33:30</a>) Has Particl been your introduction to blockchain development?</h3><p><em>“My very very first introduction to cryptocurrencies was back in 2011–2012 when I first heard about it. I didn’t really know about it at the time and kind of pushed it to the side to see what would happen before I do anything about it. Then, one of the companies I was working with started to look into crypto and that’s when I really could evaluate what was happening in the space. That’s around the time I first bought Bitcoin as well as some other coins.

That being said, that doesn’t it won’t ever happen, but as Arnold said, it’s important to focus on one thing at a thing and not spread ourselves too thin, otherwise, lots of stuff get started but few of them actually get finished up.

Kewde, who used to assume that role, has\nbeen moved over to Particl Core to work together with Tecnovert on some\ncryptography and core related tasks.\n\nMore widely known as zaSmilingIdiot [https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] within\nthe community, as per Arnold’s Github username, he has impressed quite a few\npeople by his development methodologies and insightful Github posts. Following\non lots of requests from the community, I’ve sat down earlier this week with\nArnold to run a small interview and give him the opportunity to introduce\nhimself to the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCould you give a small resume of your professional journey?\n> I started out doing what essentially would be IT Support for a couple of months\nbefore moving on to a more technical role with some development work, to\neventually doing full-time dev work. I cut my teeth with Java, and then jumped\nship to Python when the product I was involved with at the time started making\nthe move to becoming a Javascript-based platform instead. At the time I had no\nlove or want of involvement in JS. How things change…Interestingly, the company\nI had migrated to were doing some decent work with putting together their UI’s,\nand my interest piqued and I figured that javascript couldn’t be so bad after\nall (although, to clarify, I believe I might have had a tainted perspective\ngiven my previous exposure to Java). So I started becoming more actively\ninvolved in that side of things. Fast forward a few years, and while getting\nsome exposure to Ruby and Golang along the way, I’ve been pretty much involved\nin JS projects the entire time.\nFor the most part, I’ve always worked in smaller companies, although most have\nhad business/involvement with some more well-known international brands. Its\nbeen pretty amazing to know that some of what I’ve been involved with is being\nused/promoted by some larger companies and, in some cases, had a direct impact\non them. I’ve picked up some great insight into multiple industries along the\nway, from project management, IT security, mining, gambling/entertainment,\ninfrastructure management spaces, and now in the blockchain space.\n…and here we are today :)\n\nHow did you get to join Particl?\n> My brother-in-law knows Ryno, and he mentioned that he was involved with a\nnumber of projects, and that I could always apply and try to find work there if\nI wanted. I didn’t really give it much thought until Ryno got in touch with me.\nWe chatted, I had an interview and then got an offer :) In all honesty, I almost\nnever accepted, but then saw the error of my ways and quickly changed my answer!\nWhat makes you the most excited about Particl?\n> The privacy aspect is definitely a very strong contender, and I think having a\nfocus on privacy is a great baseline. We also have a great team that is skilled\nin bringing the current vision to life. So, generally, I think there is are some\nexciting times ahead already.However, in my opinion, the future potential use\ncases for Particl is what I’m most excited about. I personally see a couple of\napplications for it in the future, and it’s going to be exciting to see what\nsuggestions and integrations come through.\n\nObligatory question: Where does your ZaSmilingIdiot Github username come from?\n> Its actually a name I’ve used in gaming circles: I don’t play too much but when\nI do I’m purely in it for the fun of it. So it’s more about laughing at my own\n(usual) noobiness. Its also probably closer to being the antithesis of how I\nfeel I really am… so there’s that as well! But mostly, it’s about just having\nfun and not caring what others think of me.\nWhat is the biggest challenge you foresee with Particl?\n> I see two (my own, very likely uninformed, opinions).Firstly, in the general\ncrypto space, on-boarding users to make use of the various applications and\nproducts is the one I’m most concerned about at the moment. In terms of Particl\nand the marketplace, this translates to the idea that the average user wanting\nto purchase something online can quickly and conveniently sign in/up to a\nregular online store, and complete a purchase in a few minutes using the fiat\ncurrency already available to them. On the crypto side of the fence, unless the\nuser is already holding a certain amount of the coin of choice and has the app\nalready synced, it requires that the user follow a more complicated process.\nThis means the average mainstream buyer is likely to, at least at first, stick\nwith their current online store purchases due to convenience and ease of\ncompleting the process. A lack of buyers is also not encouraging for sellers to\nuse the platform, and so slow uptake from both sides from more mainstream users\nis likely going to slow the adoption speed. This is of course slowly changing\nand there seems to be some progress in getting cryptocurrency more “mainstream”.\nWhich is a great thing, and having the platforms like Particl marketplace\navailable to help drive this change is crucial. Of course, when we’re at the\npoint that cryptocurrency is used to buy and sell items at the cake sale down\nthe road, then we’re well and truly long past this concern. But until that\nhappens, finding unique ways to attract both buyers and sellers to the platform\nis going to be the bigger challenge.\nAgain, this is something that I see as more of a larger problem that affects\nmost other projects as well, and so keeping an eye on other projects and how\nthey solve it might allow us to generate some unique ideas of own. :D\nThe second challenge relates to the inclusion of future dApps. I’d personally\nlike to see the Desktop evolve into a platform for future dApp inclusion,\npossibly allowing for community built “plugins” that users can apply at will. I\nthink it would really take the product forward as a whole, but it’s (maybe\nfortunately :) ) not up to me. If we did ever want to progress in this\ndirection, I think we’re going to have to think about how to effectively\nstructure such a platform that keeps the privacy and decentralization aspect of\nParticl intact, without falling into the trap of becoming like any other\n(currently centralized) platform.\n\nWhat is your specific role in Particl Desktop? In other words, what is a typical\nday for you working for Particl.\n> I think it’s fairly typically a developer type of role, or what most people\nfamiliar with dev roles would expect it to be! Typically, this involves writing\ncode and/or reviewing code changes. So more than likely I’ll be the one\nreviewing pull requests and doing the code merges. Which also means running\nthrough and testing a feature/bug fix so that it does what it’s meant to do. I\nthen try to be involved in responding to Github issues, and also where possible,\ntry to assist with anything that prevents another dev from doing their job.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does look like Arnold is going to be a great asset to Particl, and it’s safe\nto say that the entire team is pretty excited about him! I’d like to thank\nArnold for the time taken to generously answer these questions and for his\ndedicated work for Particl.

In terms of Particl and the marketplace, this translates to the idea that the average user wanting to purchase something online can quickly and conveniently sign in/up to a regular online store, and complete a purchase in a few minutes using the fiat currency already available to them. On the crypto side of the fence, unless the user is already holding a certain amount of the coin of choice and has the app already synced, it requires that the user follow a more complicated process.<br>This means the average mainstream buyer is likely to, at least at first, stick with their current online store purchases due to convenience and ease of completing the process. A lack of buyers is also not encouraging for sellers to use the platform, and so slow uptake from both sides from more mainstream users is likely going to slow the adoption speed. This is of course slowly changing and there seems to be some progress in getting cryptocurrency more “mainstream”. Which is a great thing, and having the platforms like Particl marketplace available to help drive this change is crucial. Of course, when we’re at the point that cryptocurrency is used to buy and sell items at the cake sale down the road, then we’re well and truly long past this concern. But until that happens, finding unique ways to attract both buyers and sellers to the platform is going to be the bigger challenge.<br>Again, this is something that I see as more of a larger problem that affects most other projects as well, and so keeping an eye on other projects and how they solve it might allow us to generate some unique ideas of own. :D<br>The <strong>second challenge</strong> relates to the inclusion of future dApps. I’d personally like to see the Desktop evolve into a platform for future dApp inclusion, possibly allowing for community built “plugins” that users can apply at will. I think it would really take the product forward as a whole, but it’s (maybe fortunately :) ) not up to me. If we did ever want to progress in this direction, I think we’re going to have to think about how to effectively structure such a platform that keeps the privacy and decentralization aspect of Particl intact, without falling into the trap of becoming like any other (currently centralized) platform.<br></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-is-your-specific-role-in-particl-desktop-in-other-words-what-is-a-typical-day-for-you-working-for-particl-\">What is your specific role in Particl Desktop?

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nIs Making a Listing Pool for Vendors to Make Their First Listings Free Possible?\nTo fight off spammers, all Particl listings require users to submit a small\nlisting fee. This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it\nunprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale.\nTaking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for\nspammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds\ncontained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many\nstrategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and\nthat we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult\n“Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces,\ndecentralized or not.\n\nWhen is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?\nParticl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)Particl Marketplace Alpha is\nalready out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds\nthis week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it\nout, scroll down to the News & Updates section of this Community Update to find\nthe link to the blog post containing the builds.\n\nThe requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly\ndecentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet,\nand RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features\nsuch as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first\nversion of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet\nBeta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the\nmainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.\n\nAs we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop),\neach of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving\ndeadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of\nthem having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the\nmonth of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which\nwill also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of\nany kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone\nknow when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as\nit should.\n\nWhen’s the RingCT Hardfork?\nRingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve\ndecided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our\nimplementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than\nCryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation\nacademically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA.\nNote that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code\nas they requested.\n\nThe requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to\nbe fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on\nmainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it.\nThis should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and\nupdate their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact\nthat both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either\nautomatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is\nupdated to the latest version.\n\nAny plans on Presenting/Attending Events?\nYes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of\nNovember for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused\non development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the\nCommunications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the\nroad to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone\nmeeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is\ngoing to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great\nopportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.\n\nOne of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series\nof meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure\nwithin the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like\nto organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be\nsponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience\nand then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot\nof similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person\nin November and really finalize that launch strategy.\n\nWe’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as\nit relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had\ncommunity member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also\nreceived a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup\nwhich is already in the works.\n\nIt’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely\ndiligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to\nproperly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more\ndetails about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.\n\nWhat Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?\nAt the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to\nrepresent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we\nraise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.\n\nThat being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly\nencourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any\nserious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it\nlocal meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step\nup, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve\nyou!\n\nWill There Be a Launch Event?\nAbsolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be\nlaunching the marketplace on mainnet live. I’d be a great way to reveal the\nmarketplace to a large audience and get exposure from big players, investors,\nand cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We have a lot of ideas for this launch event and\nwe are quite excited to craft an exciting and fun launch strategy. The mainnet\nrelease of Particl Marketplace is a huge milestone for the Particl project, and\nwe want to make the launch event as big as the release is.\n\nAre Efforts Being Made to Create a Particl Documentary?\nNot at this time.\n\nIs Particl’s Treasurer Buying PART at These Prices?\nNo. The Particl team doesn’t hold any coin, the Particl Foundation does. The\nFoundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s\naccounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.\n\nWill Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?\nWe have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking\nfor improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes\nsense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our\nshort-term vision or requirements for the moment.\n\nWill Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?\nAs Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more\ninvolved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing.\nHe puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the\ndevelopment and the business management/organizational side of the project goes\non smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.\n\nWhen Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?\nIt’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle\nfirst on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be,\nwe’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think\nwill have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header\nneeds to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling\nmore important tasks.\n\nWe again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and\noffering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!\n\nDoes Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?\nYes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals\nright now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a\nhandful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we\nwant to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more\nestablished exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask\npointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved.\nThere’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange,\nincluding looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it\nbenefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.\n\nIt does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful\nthey are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space\nrather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.\n\nHave Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?\nNo, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but\neach exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is\nbeing considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those\nask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not\nbelieve the impact to be big enough for Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Testnet Marketplace Builds Available\nMarketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nParticl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and\ninterface experiences to Particl…\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\n\nListing governance has been added to the marketplaceOn Tuesday, we released new\nmarketplace testnet builds.

A few items have been moved around and some\nwere added to the report. For example, the report shows a new Particl Desktop\nfeature, adjustable ring size value, is now completed. It also shows that all of\nthe Settings features have now been moved to the Waiting for Review category,\nmeaning they are just about to be included in future public testnet builds.\n\nPrivate MarketsOne quite interesting development in the past two weeks have been\nthe layouts for the coming private markets and listings feature that will be\nincluded in the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace. A screenshot of\nthe Private Markets page has been shared this week, and more exist. We will\nrelease more of them when we are sure that they aren’t going to be changed\nbefore actual implementation.\n\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 is Out — Fixes Ledger Issues for MacOS Users\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 Released — Fixes Ledger Issues on MacOS\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nYesterday, we released Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been…\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\n\nWe’ve also released on the same Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been experiencing.\n\nIn other words, you shouldn’t have any issue anymore when trying to use your\nLedger hardware device on MacOS.

This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it unprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale. Taking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for spammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds contained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many strategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and that we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult “Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces, decentralized or not.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-the-marketplace-coming-on-mainnet\"><strong>When is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-HwPakrwxuZXK7Viru1THcQ.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)</figcaption></figure><p>Particl Marketplace Alpha is already out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds this week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it out, scroll down to the <em>News &amp; Updates </em>section of this Community Update to find the link to the blog post containing the builds.</p><p>The requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly decentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet, and RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features such as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first version of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet Beta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the mainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.</p><p>As we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop), each of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving deadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of them having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the month of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which will also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of any kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone know when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as it should.</p><h3 id=\"when-s-the-ringct-hardfork\">When’s the RingCT Hardfork?</h3><p>RingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve decided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our implementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than Cryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA. Note that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code as they requested.</p><p>The requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to be fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on mainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it. This should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and update their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact that both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either automatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is updated to the latest version.</p><h3 id=\"any-plans-on-presenting-attending-events\">Any plans on Presenting/Attending Events?</h3><p>Yes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of November for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused on development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the Communications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the road to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone meeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is going to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great opportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.</p><p>One of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series of meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like to organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be sponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience and then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot of similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person in November and really finalize that launch strategy.</p><p>We’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as it relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had community member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also received a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup which is already in the works.</p><p>It’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely diligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to properly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more details about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.</p><h3 id=\"what-efforts-are-made-to-attract-a-public-figure-for-particl\">What Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?</h3><p>At the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to represent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we raise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.</p><p>That being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly encourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any serious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it local meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step up, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve you!</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-launch-event\">Will There Be a Launch Event?</h3><p>Absolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be launching the marketplace on mainnet live. I’d be a great way to reveal the marketplace to a large audience and get exposure from big players, investors, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We have a lot of ideas for this launch event and we are quite excited to craft an exciting and fun launch strategy. The mainnet release of Particl Marketplace is a huge milestone for the Particl project, and we want to make the launch event as big as the release is.</p><h3 id=\"are-efforts-being-made-to-create-a-particl-documentary\">Are Efforts Being Made to Create a Particl Documentary?</h3><p>Not at this time.</p><h3 id=\"is-particl-s-treasurer-buying-part-at-these-prices\">Is Particl’s Treasurer Buying PART at These Prices?</h3><p>No. The Particl team doesn’t hold any coin, the Particl Foundation does. The Foundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s accounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-consider-changing-its-setup-and-switch-to-a-two-token-mechanism\">Will Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?</h3><p>We have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking for improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes sense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our short-term vision or requirements for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"will-ryno-be-actively-coding-on-particl\">Will Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?</h3><p>As Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more involved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing. He puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the development and the business management/organizational side of the project goes on smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.</p><h3 id=\"when-will-the-bitcointalk-thread-be-updated\">When Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?</h3><p>It’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle first on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be, we’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think will have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header needs to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling more important tasks.</p><p>We again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and offering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!</p><h3 id=\"does-particl-plan-on-getting-on-more-exchanges\">Does Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?</h3><p>Yes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals right now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a handful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we want to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more established exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask pointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved. There’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange, including looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it benefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.</p><p>It does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful they are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space rather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.</p><h3 id=\"have-funds-been-made-available-for-the-binance-application\">Have Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?</h3><p>No, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but each exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is being considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those ask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not believe the impact to be big enough for Particl.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-testnet-marketplace-builds-available\">New Testnet Marketplace Builds Available</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><strong>Marketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><em>Particl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and interface experiences to Particl…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-WnAqX3iaOMTJzurtdTn0LQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Listing governance has been added to the marketplace</figcaption></figure><p>On Tuesday, we released new marketplace testnet builds.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nLast week’s livestream was a special edition as we had the great pleasure to\nwelcome Gerlof van Ek, Particl’s Lead Designer, on the livestream as a guest.\n\nGerlof, more commonly known as Crz within the community, has gained valuable\nexperience working for international companies like Disney, Yves Rocher and\nother major design companies. He’s made a name for himself working and\nfreelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as \nShadowcash, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand\nin EOS (logo/branding), Nexus, CryptoFR [https://cryptofr.com/], BitcoinFR\n[https://bitcoin.fr/], Blocktix, a few exchanges and — of course —Particl, to\nname a few.\n\nGerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is\nin charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about\nGerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at \n2:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s]!\n\n(10:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s]) Could you please elaborate a bit\non the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t\naffected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?\nThe Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually\npretty critical\n[https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362]\n, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the\nlargest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently\nintroduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions,\nmeaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by\nit (for example, PIVX).\n\nAs for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is\nsimply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our\ncore development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this\nvulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential\nTransactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even\nbefore we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been\naffected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of\nour core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this\nclaim!.\n\n(13:48 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s]) Has the Particl UI been designed\nin such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?\nYes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes\nusing HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing two default themes\n, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl\nDesktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings\npage and set up their client to automatically change the theme at a specific\ntime of the day, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by\nthe community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or\nparticularly appreciated by the team.\n\n(15:44 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s]) Gerlof, it’s been said that\nyou’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS),\nso with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as\nopposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?\nParaphrased: Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main\nproject. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an\nidea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see\nhow far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we\nhave a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented\nindividuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and\nmotivating, which makes for a great work environment.\n\n(17:39 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s]) When you first started working\nwith Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer,\npart of the initial team?\nParaphrased: We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come\nand go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The\nvision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on\nit and we found new core members along the way which are now important\ncomponents of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now\nwith around 15 developers actively working on the project and it is amazing to\nsee!\n\nEverything is carefully planned, and we have daily meetings (sometimes more than\none per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a\nreally professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team\nmember we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the\nclock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the\nbackend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking\nParticl to the next level!\n\n(20:31 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s]) Will Particl Desktop’s page\neventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream\npotential?\nYes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl\nDesktop, but we do want to redesign/rebuild the Overview page to change it to a\nmore customizable one with the help of Particl widgets. That is because buyers\nand vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch\nParticl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales\ndata, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their\npurchasing history or favored items.\n\nSimilarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers\nif the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they\ncan immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users\nmight be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues\non ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl\nDesktop a true dashboard.\n\nBecause every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop\nto be very customizable. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is\nto have a complete installer that launches the first time you launch the client.\nThis installer will allow users to choose what decentralized applications they\nwant to be included in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set\ntheir client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user\nmight be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she\ncould disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in\nterms of resources. This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design\ntheir most optimal Particl Desktop setup.\n\n> It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy\ndevelopment phase and mostly a testing environment for now.\nThese are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything\nbeing built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and\neverything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to\ntest the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give\nus as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our #testing\n[https://discord.gg/m27aqEq] or #Open-Development [https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q] \nchannels or directly on the Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. It’s important to try\ndifferent approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and\nwhat doesn’t.\n\nParticl-Desktop — Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\nParticl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\n\n(24:59 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&feature=youtu.be&t=24m59s])\nIs Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?\nYes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example,\nJoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or\n3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a\nton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on\nParticl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese\nfor the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive\nt-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as\na good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d\nlike to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and\ngo-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past\nfew weeks!\n\nParticl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nFriday, October 5, 2018\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\n\nWe also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK\npointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note\nthat we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a\ndesire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage\nanyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact\nus, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve\nalso started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may\nbe hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we\nare still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great\nopportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be\nlooking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and\nbeyond.\n\n(44:03 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s]) Is there a limit to the number of\nlistings Particl Marketplace can support?\nNo! There is no upper limit to how many items Particl Marketplace can support!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Particl Core and Particl Desktop Versions Released\nParticl Core 0.17.0.1 and Desktop 1.3 are released\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nToday, Particl Core 0.17.0.1 was released on the heels of Bitcoin Core 0.17.0\nreleased yesterday.\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\n\nWe’ve released yesterday two major updates to our clients: Particl Desktop 1.3,\nand Particl Core 0.17.0.1. Both these updates are important, especially for\nParticl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17.

He’s made a name for himself working and freelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as <strong>Shadowcash</strong>, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand in <strong>EOS </strong>(logo/branding), <strong>Nexus</strong>, <a href=\"https://cryptofr.com/\"><strong>CryptoFR</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://bitcoin.fr/\"><strong>BitcoinFR</strong></a>, <strong>Blocktix</strong>, a few exchanges and — of course — <strong>Particl</strong>, to name a few.</p><p>Gerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is in charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about Gerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s\"><strong>2:10</strong></a>!</p><h3 id=\"-10-10-could-you-please-elaborate-a-bit-on-the-bitcoin-ddos-bug-that-was-disclosed-how-is-it-possible-particl-isn-t-affected-since-it-s-built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s\">10:10</a>) Could you please elaborate a bit on the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t affected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?</h3><p>The Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually pretty <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362\">critical</a>, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the largest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions, meaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by it (for example, PIVX).</p><p>As for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is simply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our core development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this vulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even before we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been affected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of our core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this claim!.</p><h3 id=\"-13-48-has-the-particl-ui-been-designed-in-such-a-way-that-will-make-it-easy-to-apply-skins-to-it\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s\">13:48</a>) Has the Particl UI been designed in such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?</h3><p>Yes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes using HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing <strong>two default themes</strong>, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl Desktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings page and set up their client to <strong>automatically change the theme at a specific time of the day</strong>, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by the community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or particularly appreciated by the team.</p><h3 id=\"-15-44-gerlof-it-s-been-said-that-you-ve-helped-other-crypto-teams-with-their-graphics-and-branding-such-as-eos-so-with-that-in-mind-what-made-you-choose-to-join-particl-as-a-team-member-as-opposed-to-any-of-the-other-teams-you-ve-worked-with\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s\">15:44</a>) Gerlof, it’s been said that you’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS), so with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as opposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased:</strong> <em>Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main project. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an idea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see how far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we have a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented individuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and motivating, which makes for a great work environment.</em></p><h3 id=\"-17-39-when-you-first-started-working-with-ryno-was-it-just-the-two-of-you-or-was-tecnovert-or-any-other-developer-part-of-the-initial-team\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s\">17:39</a>) When you first started working with Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer, part of the initial team?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased: </strong><em>We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come and go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The vision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on it and we found new core members along the way which are now important components of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now with around </em><em><strong>15 developers</strong></em><em> actively working on the project and it is amazing to see!</em></p><p><em>Everything is carefully planned, and we have </em><em><strong>daily meetings</strong></em><em> (sometimes more than one per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a really professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team member we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the clock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the backend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking Particl to the next level!</em></p><h3 id=\"-20-31-will-particl-desktop-s-page-eventually-default-to-the-marketplace-for-the-sake-of-usability-and-mainstream-potential\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s\">20:31</a>) Will Particl Desktop’s page eventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream potential?</h3><p>Yes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl Desktop, but we do want to <strong>redesign/rebuild the Overview page</strong> to change it to a more <strong>customizable</strong> one with the help of <strong>Particl widgets</strong>. That is because buyers and vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch Particl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>. It’s important to try different approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and what doesn’t.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Particl-Desktop — Issues</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><em>Particl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">github.com</a></p><h3 id=\"-24-59-is-particl-making-plans-to-have-more-sponsored-ambassadors-per-country\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m59s\">24:59</a>) Is Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?</h3><p>Yes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

He’s made a name for himself working and freelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as <strong>Shadowcash</strong>, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand in <strong>EOS </strong>(logo/branding), <strong>Nexus</strong>, <a href=\"https://cryptofr.com/\"><strong>CryptoFR</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://bitcoin.fr/\"><strong>BitcoinFR</strong></a>, <strong>Blocktix</strong>, a few exchanges and — of course — <strong>Particl</strong>, to name a few.</p><p>Gerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is in charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about Gerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s\"><strong>2:10</strong></a>!</p><h3 id=\"-10-10-could-you-please-elaborate-a-bit-on-the-bitcoin-ddos-bug-that-was-disclosed-how-is-it-possible-particl-isn-t-affected-since-it-s-built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s\">10:10</a>) Could you please elaborate a bit on the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t affected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?</h3><p>The Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually pretty <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362\">critical</a>, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the largest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions, meaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by it (for example, PIVX).</p><p>As for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is simply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our core development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this vulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even before we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been affected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of our core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this claim!.</p><h3 id=\"-13-48-has-the-particl-ui-been-designed-in-such-a-way-that-will-make-it-easy-to-apply-skins-to-it\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s\">13:48</a>) Has the Particl UI been designed in such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?</h3><p>Yes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes using HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing <strong>two default themes</strong>, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl Desktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings page and set up their client to <strong>automatically change the theme at a specific time of the day</strong>, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by the community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or particularly appreciated by the team.</p><h3 id=\"-15-44-gerlof-it-s-been-said-that-you-ve-helped-other-crypto-teams-with-their-graphics-and-branding-such-as-eos-so-with-that-in-mind-what-made-you-choose-to-join-particl-as-a-team-member-as-opposed-to-any-of-the-other-teams-you-ve-worked-with\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s\">15:44</a>) Gerlof, it’s been said that you’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS), so with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as opposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased:</strong> <em>Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main project. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an idea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see how far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we have a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented individuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and motivating, which makes for a great work environment.</em></p><h3 id=\"-17-39-when-you-first-started-working-with-ryno-was-it-just-the-two-of-you-or-was-tecnovert-or-any-other-developer-part-of-the-initial-team\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s\">17:39</a>) When you first started working with Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer, part of the initial team?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased: </strong><em>We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come and go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The vision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on it and we found new core members along the way which are now important components of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now with around </em><em><strong>15 developers</strong></em><em> actively working on the project and it is amazing to see!</em></p><p><em>Everything is carefully planned, and we have </em><em><strong>daily meetings</strong></em><em> (sometimes more than one per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a really professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team member we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the clock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the backend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking Particl to the next level!</em></p><h3 id=\"-20-31-will-particl-desktop-s-page-eventually-default-to-the-marketplace-for-the-sake-of-usability-and-mainstream-potential\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s\">20:31</a>) Will Particl Desktop’s page eventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream potential?</h3><p>Yes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl Desktop, but we do want to <strong>redesign/rebuild the Overview page</strong> to change it to a more <strong>customizable</strong> one with the help of <strong>Particl widgets</strong>. That is because buyers and vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch Particl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>. It’s important to try different approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and what doesn’t.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Particl-Desktop — Issues</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><em>Particl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">github.com</a></p><h3 id=\"-24-59-is-particl-making-plans-to-have-more-sponsored-ambassadors-per-country\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=24m59s\">24:59</a>) Is Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?</h3><p>Yes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).
