The immediate\nproblem is that these cryptocurrencies generally reside on separate blockchains,\nwhich do not offer a lot of interoperability.\n\nDevelopers and tech entrepreneurs of all kinds have spotted this need in the\nmarket and went to work trying to bring to life a series of decentralized\ntrading exchanges — often abbreviated as \"DEX\".  This led to an increase in the\nnumber of DEXs and decentralized trading protocols which, in truth, really have\nlarge degrees of variation between them in terms of decentralization or even\nstraight up usability.\n\nOne thing that can be observed is that, even today with dozens upon dozens of\nDEXs, a substantial quantity of them focus exclusively on intra-chain swaps,\nmeaning swapping different assets belonging to the same chain together. Those\nare unfortunately very restricted in their swapping abilities, and do not fix\nthe underlying issues regarding important but perhaps more difficult to\nintegrate blockchains like Monero.\n\nCrossing the Chain Barrier\nTo many users, the details of how such cross-chain trades are accomplished under\nthe hood is not very much on their mind — and the distinction may even seem\nfutile. The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to\nbe able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the\nBinance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability\noffered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those\nusers’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional\nprivacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about\ndecentralization and privacy.\n\nThere is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many\nbold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are\nput forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is\ngenerally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty\nboth in terms of decentralization and of security.\n\nA common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or\n\"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed\nbe decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a wrapped asset on\nthe very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A wrapped asset is a token\non a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be\nmirroring.\n\nThe original asset is held, in custody, by a third-party which then issues a\ntoken worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian\nto its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it\nin exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your\ncoins”.\n\nUnfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (which has happened\nin the past\n[https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/]) there is\nabsolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly reverse\nor freeze your transactions\n[https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/] \nthemselves, or lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets\n[https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/]\n. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything\ndecentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnother common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with\nimportant challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains,\nor with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.\n\nThe Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs\nAtomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been first proposed\nin\n2013\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784]\n. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap\ncryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and\ncondition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo\none's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to\ntheir original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing\natomic swaps.\n\nBut even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to\nachieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely\ndifferent chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric\ncoins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private\nblockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly and decentralized\nalternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both,\nor deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic\nGUI.\n\nAtomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire\ntrue cross-chain operability on a bona fide exchange, and without giving in an\ninch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network,\nor layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is\nprecisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely\navailable between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.\n\nThat’s in major part what motivated us to build BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] — a \ncross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX. When you trade, say,\nBitcoin to Monero on the BasicSwap orderbook, no extensive node configuration is\nneeded, and absolutely no wrapping of assets takes place. We instead made true\ncross-chain swaps possible by combining two groundbreaking protocols; atomic\nswaps, and Particl’s own SMSG mixnet network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]SMSG: A layer\n2 Solution for Cross-Chain Interoperability\nBitcoin advocates often mention the role of cross-chain operability will be\nfilled by the Lightning Network. Years have passed and, although we are seeing\nnominal progress on that end, it is unfortunately very slow and still\ncomplicated to setup. But because the ability to swap cryptocurrencies with full\nprivacy is of dire need in this day and age, we’ve decided to take control of\nthings and build exactly a solution for that: BasicSwap.\n\nSecureMessaging (SMSG)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG],\na P2P messaging network inspired by BitMessage and developed by the particl.io\nteam, is what powers the BasicSwap DEX in place of the Lightning Network.\n\nIt acts as the required messaging layer for the accomplishment of BasicSwap’s\ntruly decentralized cross-chain DEX. SMSG is a simple message mixnet, where all\nnodes store a copy of everyone's end-to-end encrypted messages for a limited\nperiod of time. The sender of a message cannot exactly pinpoint the IP address\nof the receiver, because the messages defuse over the entire network.\n\nAll nodes attempt to decrypt every incoming message - if the HMAC\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC]check fails, then the message was either\nfraudulent or not addressed for you. This technology allowed us to successfully\nbuild a powerful and truly cross-chain DEX, that works using atomic swaps and \n'scriptless scripts'\n[https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/scriptless-scripts-schnorr].\n\nThis allows BasicSwap to relay vital atomic swap information from one chain to\nan entirely different one, even Monero, in a seamless and user-friendly manner\nand without coin wrapping, custodian entity, or any other centralized\nenvironment. This layer 2 acts as a powerful, entirely distributed bridge\nbetween chains that otherwise have nothing in common — an uncompromisingly\ndistributed alternative with incredible potential for easy-to-use third-party\nintegrations and contributions.\n\nTo learn more about BasicSwap, refer to this in-depth blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] or have a\nlook at its section on the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we stand today - trying to move the ball forward, always, towards a new\nera of decentralized cryptocurrency trading.

in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]BasicSwap is\na cross-chain and private decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol and a trading\napp that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another without any middleman\nor third-party being involved.\n\nIt lets you make or take orders on a distributed order book and execute swaps\nthat are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and private. All of this combined sets\nBasicSwap apart as a DEX with uncompromising ease of use, security and\ndecentralization, and creates an environment that is totally free of any central\npoint of failure. Best of all: there are absolutely no trading fees!\n\nWe’ve already published an extensive blog post explaining everything you need\nto\nknow about BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]. So if you\nwant more information on this upcoming breakthrough DEX, make sure to give it a\nread!\n\nAbout BasicSwap’s User Interface\nAs you may already be aware, the BasicSwap back-end protocol (\"swap engine\") has\nbeen operational as an early beta software for a while, allowing mainnet swaps\nto take place between a range of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nParticl and even Monero.\n\nHowever, what it lacked, up until today, was a user-friendly and easy-to-use\ninterface to facilitate the act of trading on the platform. As we’ve often seen\nwithin the blockchain industry, the user experience is of the utmost importance.\n\nThat’s why we’ve opted to wait until BasicSwap’s user-friendly GUI was ready\nbefore publicly releasing the beta. And now that this is done, we enter a new\nphase for BasicSwap!\n\nThe Final Closed Beta Testing Round Begins Today\nWith the first version of the BasicSwap GUI now completed (v0.1), we have now\nbegun the final closed beta testing round before the public launch of the open\nbeta.\n\nDuring this final round, we’ll thoroughly test the user interface across a wide\nrange of environments and scenarios as well as the DEX protocol itself. This\nwill ensure the smoothest and most hassle-free open beta launch (public)\npossible.\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap’s Status?\nBasicSwap is a beta product and still under development. The release of the open\nbeta is a major milestone in its development but it is by no means a completed\nproduct.\n\nAs such, there may be missing features, quirks in the user experience, and areas\nof improvement. This is normal at this stage, and that’s precisely where we need\nyou!\n\nIf, during the upcoming open beta, you encounter any issue, bug, or discover\nareas of improvements, be sure to let us know by logging it on the DEX’s issue\npage [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/issues]. This also applies to\ngeneral comment, feedback, and suggestions; they are the entire reason for an\nopen beta!\n\nIssues · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept.

That’s because\nit is highly dependent on how the final closed beta testing round goes.\n\nHowever, we don’t expect that testing period to last for a long time. We’ll be\nsure to communicate clearly the launch date a few days before.\n\nHow Can I Support the Upcoming Open Beta Launch?\nAs the open beta launch approaches rapidly, there are a few things you can\nalready do to pre-emptively help out.\n\nFirst and foremost, BasicSwap uses an order book system to match traders\ntogether rather than a single liquidity pool. That means its user experience\ndepends in major part on the liquidity available on the books.\n\nAs such, putting liquidity on BasicSwap when it releases not only grants you\naccess to a healthier trading environment on which you can trade, but it also\nhelps others match their trades, making BasicSwap a more viable solution for all\nand, in turn, bringing more liquidity as a result.\n\nSimilarly to putting liquidity on the books, every attempt at getting the word\nout also helps immensely. Whether that be to friends, in your online\ncommunities, on Reddit or crypto Twitter, any place is a good place to let\nothers, who may benefit from what BasicSwap has to offer, know about it.\n\nA DEX thrives the bigger its user base is; we all win by bringing more people to\nBasicSwap and providing liquidity!\n\nBasicSwap Website About to Go Live\nTo support the public launch of BasicSwap’s beta and help others better\nunderstand how the platform benefits them, we will launch a new website entirely\ndedicated to BasicSwap. This will be an incredibly useful tool that will make it\neasier to share with others what vital benefits they can get for using a\nproperly decentralized and privacy-focused trading platform.\n\nThe launch of the BasicSwap website is planned for before the launch of the open\nbeta.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA better, more private, and fair-to-all trading environment looms and there’s no\nturning back!\n\nAs always, we will keep you posted about it through our weekly development\nprogress reports available on Particl News.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
