In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public. While you share\nyour Particl address with others so that they can send you coins, your Particl\naddress is only a hash of your public key, not the public key itself.\n\n> A hash function is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and\nturns it into a cryptographic output. By one-way I mean that you can’t derive\nthe input from the output. It’s kind of like encrypting something then losing\nthe key.\nWhat does that mean in English?\nAll of that is a complicated way of saying that while an attacker with a quantum\ncomputer could derive the private key from the public key, they couldn’t derive\nthe public key from the Particl address since the public key was run through\nmultiple quantum-resistant one-way hash functions.\n\n— Classic!So how does this all fit together?\nThe cold staking feature consists of several key components:\n\n * your “staking node” (running a new wallet)\n * your “wallet” with your coins (much like today) and\n * a “cold staking script” — this is like the script in bitcoin or smart\n   contracts on other alts\n\nOnce activated your staking node signs transactions with its private key, thus\nyour real public key for your actual PART tokens is never exposed onto the\nblockchain, until you actually spend them, in which case the change always goes\ninto a new address where the public key is not known.\n\nCold Staking In Action\nAgain, cold staking consists of the following components — your staking node,\nyour wallet and a cold staking script.\n\nWhat is the cold staking script?\n\nIt is essentially a smart contract that says `if this is a cold staking\ntransaction, then allow the private key from the staking node to sign the\ntransaction; otherwise the private key from the wallet is required.`\n\nLet’s walk through the process of setting cold staking up\n1First step is to setup a new “staking node”. A staking node is a full\nblockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet”\n(aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a\ndedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.\n\n> It is important to note that CPU does matter when staking, so do not expect to\nget the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.\nOnce the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then\ngenerate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in\nthe next step).\n\n**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will\nbe made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is\ndeemed secure.**\n\n2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold\nStaking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1).\nEnter this and click activate.\n\nSo what exactly did we just do?\nFirst, you have created a cold staking script config which includes the public\nkey for the staking node to whom you have delegated staking powers to.\n\nSecond, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block\nfrom staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress\nbar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS\ncurrently does) but these outputs will be part of the cold staking script.\n\nThird, the next time you spend any Particl from your wallet the client will also\nautomatically include the cold staking script— from thereon. Once the Cold\nStaking progress bar reaches 100% activation your wallet can remain offline and\nthe staking node you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without\nrisking any of the PART in your wallet.\n\nIt is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script”\nsmart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies\nto cold staking:\n\n> if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same\naddress with the same minimum value as the input\nIn short, what this means is “If I staked 1,000 PART from my\nPar7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address then 1,000 PART must go back to the\nsame address” for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.\n\nThis is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake\nyour coins and not spend them.\n\nIt is also worth noting here that any value greater than the input value, aka\nthe reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node. So in\ntheory you could — as part of cold staking — send your staked coins back to your\nwallet address (as per consensus) and send the stake reward to a different\naddress.\n\n?Future Applications\nThis flexibility at the protocol consensus level pave the road for several new\nfeatures in the future such as:\n\n * staking pools\n * donating staking rewards to other causes\n * sending staking rewards to exchange to provide liquidity\n\nThe cold staking protocol is agnostic, so that it works with all public balances\n(anon and blind cannot stake) including those protected by multi-signature\naddresses.\n\nIn the future we envision an upgrade to our Particl Copay App that will add Cold\nStaking support. That will allow us to take advantage of the wallet’s excellent\nmulti-signature support and enable a whole host of new security benefits,\nincluding but not limited to:\n\n * cold staking with multi-signature (ie. your “staking node” will stake but to\n   spend funds you will need m-of-n signatures\n * integration with hardware devices (like Ledger or Trezor) for key signing\n   (providing the utmost level of security when combined with multi-signature\n   and cold staking).\n\nBrief statement about tomorrow’s hardfork\nAs the hardfork cometh at midnight, we’re going to let everyone continue to\nupgrade and track the health of the blockchain for around 12–24 hours. We know\neveryone is anxious to build their Cold Staking contract but what is most\nimportant is ensuring the blockchain and all PART are secure.\n\nThe GUI is getting waxed and buffed for tomorrow’s debut and we’re also\npreparing some guides for the GUI so people can walk through setting up your\ncold staking contracts.\n\nThank you\nParticl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Primer--Cold-Staking-on-Particl/0-HrZMzdYyRd0LIyut.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"quantum-computer-resistant\">Quantum Computer Resistant</h2><p><strong>How? </strong>In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public.

A staking node is a full blockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet” (aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a dedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.</p><blockquote>It is important to note that CPU <strong>does</strong> matter when staking, so do not expect to get the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.</blockquote><p>Once the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then generate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in the next step).</p><p><strong>**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will be made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is deemed secure.**</strong></p><p>2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold Staking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1). Enter this and click activate.</p><h3 id=\"so-what-exactly-did-we-just-do\">So what exactly did we just do?</h3><p>First, you have created a <strong>cold staking script</strong> config which includes the public key for the <strong>staking node</strong> to whom you have delegated staking powers to.</p><p>Second, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block from staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress bar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS currently does) but these outputs will be part of the <strong>cold staking script</strong>.</p><p>Third, the next time you spend any Particl from your <strong>wallet</strong> the client will also automatically include the <strong>cold staking script</strong> — from thereon. Once the Cold Staking progress bar reaches 100% activation your <strong>wallet</strong> can remain offline and the <strong>staking node</strong> you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without risking any of the PART in your wallet.</p><p><strong>It is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script” smart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies to cold staking:</strong></p><blockquote>if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same address with the same minimum value as the input</blockquote><p>In short, what this means is <em>“If I staked 1,000 PART from my Par7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address </em><em><strong>then</strong></em><em> 1,000 PART must go back to the same address”</em> for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.</p><p><strong>This is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake your coins and not spend them.</strong></p><p>It is also worth noting here that any value <strong>greater</strong> than the input value, aka the reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node. So in theory you could — as part of cold staking — send your staked coins back to your wallet address (as per consensus) and send the stake reward to a different address.</p><h2 id=\"-future-applications\">?Future Applications</h2><p>This flexibility at the protocol consensus level pave the road for several new features in the future such as:</p><ul><li>staking pools</li><li>donating staking rewards to other causes</li><li>sending staking rewards to exchange to provide liquidity</li></ul><p>The cold staking protocol is agnostic, so that it works with all public balances (anon and blind cannot stake) including those protected by multi-signature addresses.</p><p>In the future we envision an upgrade to our Particl Copay App that will add Cold Staking support.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
