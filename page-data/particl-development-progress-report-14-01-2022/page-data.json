This week, a lot of focus has been put on adding seemingly small but\nquite useful features and improvements to Particl Marketplace.\n\nOther than that, a good amount of focus has also gone into fixing a few minor\nissues and adding general improvements based on various feedback obtained from\nParticl Marketplace users. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop and Marketplace Progress Update\nAs part of the additions and improvements mentioned in the introduction of this\nprogress report, there are four main items worth mentioning, the others being\nvery minor.\n\n 1. Combined the market ID and access/publish key into a single value. This\n    means that there's now only a single value that needs to be copied/used when\n    sharing/joining a market. This is mostly a convenience modification; instead\n    of needing two different values, a single value can be shared.\n 2. Modified how a template for the product is edited. This was required mostly\n    because the large \"Edit Product\" button on a template resulted in the\n    product template being modified, leading to confusion when an existing\n    market template is published and did not contain the modified content. So\n    now the button to edit the market template has been made a little more\n    visible, and the edit product button has been moved to a different location\n    to ensure that it's easier to understand how to edit an existing item.\n 3. Removing the forced requirement to have the Open Market automatically joined\n    and the ability to remove it from the list of markets your client is\n    connected to. This task is in progress and should be completed imminently.\n 4. Displaying a different graphic and message to indicate when no listings are\n    found but the blockchain is still busy syncing. This is part of a wider push\n    to improve various aspects of the marketplace application that may cause\n    confusion, especially to people who are trying Particl for the first time.\n    You can expect a few updates sharing this goal to be included in the next\n    Particl Desktop update.\n\nWhile the aforementioned items are what received the vast majority of this\nweek's focus, we can confirm that in-market messaging (buyer <> seller\nmessaging) is still the primary priority when it comes to new features for\nParticl Desktop 3.2. \n\nAs previously mentioned, this is an early implementation of a wider \"chat\napplication\" that will ultimately let you discuss with others in total privacy\n(no metadata) and without any central server in between processing and passing\nmessages around. The \"in-market\" implementation, namely the ability for buyers\nand sellers to talk to each other on the marketplace, is the first version of\nthat broader vision.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl core developer, Tecnovert, has been busy backporting Taproot\ninto the Particl Core 0.19 codebase. While Taproot will be fully functional on\n0.21 following this coming hardfork\n[https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/] (1st of February at 17:00 UTC),\nit wouldn't be the case for Particl Core 0.19 without these current\nmodifications.\n\nTaproot Hardfork Announcement (February 2022)Learn everything you need to know\nabout Particl’s upcoming hardfork and prepare ahead with Particl Core\n0.19.2.18.\nParticl Newscryptoguard [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/]And\nbecause Particl currently uses both the 0.19 and 0.21 codebases, it's important\nto ensure that Taproot is compatible and recognized by 0.19 nodes so that no\nissue arises. But more than that, we are happy to report that 0.19 nodes will\nalso be fully compatible with Taproot, just like 0.21, meaning they will not\nonly recognize Taproot transactions but offer full support for it as well.\n\nAside from this rather large task, Tecnovert has spent a good amount of time\nwriting and running tests to make sure the upcoming hardfork goes through\nwithout any issue.\n\nRenewed Particl Team Funding Proposal is Open for Discussion\nAlthough not a development update per se, we wanted to let you know that the\nParticl team has published, on the CCS platform\n[/particl-development-progress-report-15-01-2022/ccs.particl.io], its renewed\nfunding request [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/12].\n\nTeam Funding Proposal #2Learn all the details about the Particl team’s second\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-2/]As a reminder, the Particl team\nis funded exclusively from the network's decentralized treasury. Every six\nmonths, the team needs to renew its funding with a clear proposal that has to\nget approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nWith the first funding cycle coming to an end in February, the team's second\nfunding request has been published earlier this week and is currently open for\ndiscussion. We invite you to ask your questions and give your feedback by\nleaving a comment directly on the proposal's CCS page.\n\nThe start block of the voting period will be announced next week, so stay tuned\nto Particl News [https://particl.news] for that important information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe thank you all for your passion, dedication, and valuable contributions to the\nParticl project; you are what makes Particl possible!\n\nWhether you actively work on expanding the ecosystem or simply use the\nmarketplace and send your feedback to the team, every bit helps shaping the\nfuture of de-commerce (decentralized e-commerce) and easing its adoption!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and we'll see you, like always, back on Monday ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This team proposal is just one example of what anyone can\npropose to Particl stakeholders.\nTable of Contents\n * Progress Since the First Funding Request\n * The Funding Request in Details\n * Vision and Development Priorities\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Since the First Funding Request\nAbout 6 months ago, the Particl team started drawing funds from the treasury\nafter its first funding request was approved by Particl stakeholders. Since that\ntime, we’ve worked on improving and expanding the ecosystem with various\nimprovements and additions. \n\nHere’s a brief list of what we’ve done since being granted funds from the\ntreasury.\n\n * Particl V3 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/])\n * Particl V3.1 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/])\n * Announce BasicSwap, a cross-chain and private DEX, and prep it for its open\n   beta (learn more [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/])\n * New Particl.io website (check it out [https://particl.io/])\n * New roadmap (check it out [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/])\n * Published our short to mid-term marketing plans (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/])\n * 10 Particl Core releases, including 0.21.x.x pre-releases (learn more\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Scheduled a new hardfork to fully activate Taproot (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/])\n * Particl Electrum wallet with Lightning Network support (work-in-progress\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-10-09-2021#particl-core-development-report]\n   )\n * New legal entity formed to support the project\n\nRoadmap Progress\nAside from the project-wide milestones mentioned above, we’ve also made great\ndevelopment progress. Here are the roadmap items we’ve completed or made\nprogress to during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We announced that we would be releasing a new app into the Particl\necosystem; BasicSwap. BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange (DEX) protocol that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another\nwithout any middleman or third-party being involved. It is currently in closed\nbeta; its open beta is expected to begin very shortly in early 2022. \n\nWeb framework Although we haven’t officially communicated on this yet, we’ve\nmade preliminary progress in building certain aspects of what will allow Particl\napps, like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap, to be accessible from the web. We\nwill be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are\nlikely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at\nonce. We’ll have more information to share a bit later on. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality We’ve released an update to the cold staking zap\nfunctionality that allows for more a granular management of the zapping process.\nThe process has been optimized and made more private. You can also now choose\nbetween two zapping options; optimized for staking or optimized for privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Although not yet released, we’ve worked on a new light wallet\nfor Particl: Particl Electrum. It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum\nwallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need\nto sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in\nsome of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides\n\"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the\nblockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the\nLightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to\nParticl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment. \n\nTaproot Support In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the\nlong-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new\nfeatures and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/]. \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import/management We added to Particl Desktop 3.1 many\nimprovements to the inventory management aspect of the marketplace. Sellers now\nhave access to more options when importing their inventory from CSV files and\ncan easily adjust their product prices in bulk to account for any PART price\nchanges. A notable variety of other improvements related to the management and\npublishing of listings has also been added. \n\nAdjustable escrow deposit ratios A major item we’ve completed with Particl\nDesktop 3.1 is the addition of a customizable security deposit ratio for\nmarketplace escrows. Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock\n100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security\ndeposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with\nParticl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios\nbetween 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from\nmarketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and\nuse-cases. \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two major additions mentioned\nabove, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added\nto Particl Marketplace. Because there is way too much to mention here, we invite\nyou to check out the full list of changes available here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements Various additions, improvements, and bug\nfixes have been made to Particl Desktop. These are changes that are not\nexclusive to the marketplace app itself. Just like with the general marketplace\nimprovements, the list of changes is too big to put here; we invite you to check\nout the full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nThe Funding Request in Details\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests supporting the Particl team and funding its\noperations by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for 6 months\n. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will\nthen publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes\nother than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be\nallocated.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap\n   (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile\n   platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the\n   development team.\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this\n   funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words,\n   not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds\n   being available for later on.\n * Management, legal, and administration (10%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (10%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing\n   (and promotion) budgets.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the\nteam. \n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide\nfunding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related\nactivities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the\nteam may rearrange it as needed.\nVision and Development Priorities\nAfter spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a\nlot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind\nyou, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year,\nthere’ll be much more to show for it.\n\nIn fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s\nthe time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger\ndifference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much\neasier than it was before.\n\nDevelopment Priorities\nWith this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6\nmonths. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we\nconstantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be\nadded to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an\never-evolving situation.\n\nFor more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by\nfollowing this link [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/].\n\nNew Roadmap Revealed (2021)Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn\nabout the next critical steps forward.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/] General\nBasicSwap DEX BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022.\nWith its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and\npublicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to\nannounce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that\nregard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other\nlevel, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s\ngeneral adoption and exposure within the space. \n\nWeb framework The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl\napplications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser\nwithout the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to\ndownload any application. This item will be delivered in increments and we\nexpect that we'll deliver some of the first components of this system during\nthis development cycle. It is a major part of making Particl more accessible to\nthe world and easing its adoption. \n\nKeeping Particl Core up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin code As you probably\nalready know, the Particl coin is a next-generation privacy coin. It uses RingCT\nand CT, much like Monero, but uniquely uses the Bitcoin codebase. As is usual,\nwe pledge to keep its code up-to-date with all the Bitcoin updates, which is\ncritical both in terms of security and usability. \n\nParticl Electrum This new Particl light wallet, based on the very popular\nBitcoin Electrum wallet, provides a lot of “light” functionalities that can be\nleveraged for the many projects we have in mind, notably putting together a new,\nbetter mobile wallet for example. Although that mobile wallet might not see the\nday during the first half of 2022, we expect that, at least, Particl Electrum\nwill. \n\nSMSG 2.0 To ensure that Particl can sustain a much larger number of users, and\nto improve the reliability and performance of applications such as Particl\nMarketplace and the BasicSwap DEX, an update to Particl’s SMSG network is\nplanned for 2022. While we don’t fully expect it to be ready by the end of this\n6-month development period, we are confident that we’ll be making valuable\nprogress towards it. \n\nMarketplace\nBuy flow messaging This Particl Marketplace feature will let buyers and sellers\ncommunicate directly from within Particl Desktop. This is a widely-requested\nfeature that will massively improve the user experience of the marketplace and\nimprove its potential for adoption. This is a preliminary version of a more\ncomplete “chat application” that will eventually serve as a distributed and\nprivate alternative to messaging applications such as a Signal, Telegram,\nElement, etc. \n\nMobile and web gateway (buyers) As we incrementally build components of the web\nframework, they make available some low-hanging fruits. This is the case, for\nexample, of both a web and mobile gateway for buyers. They would make it\npossible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and\npurchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain\nand SMSG network. The early versions of these gateways are expected to be\nrelatively basic but will serve as a good showcase of what the web framework\nwill ultimately allow. \n\nDesktop\nSMSG controller integration The SMSG controller is more of a back-end\ndeliverable that improves how Particl applications interact with the SMSG\nnetwork. While this item may not lead to apparent changes to the end-user, it\nmakes Particl applications more efficient and lets them support more complex\nfeatures. This is a requirement for more advanced SMSG functionalities such as\napplication extensions and desktop plugins (formerly known as “SMSG bots”). \n\nApp extensions and plugins App extensions and Particl Desktop plugins are\nadd-ons that enhance the user experience. Often, they are third-party services\nthat provide valuable functionality such as allowing you to swap\ncryptocurrencies from the desktop app, get price data through oracles, and so\non. While Particl itself is entirely decentralized, these opt-in modules provide\nuseful features that might require third-parties to get involved. By being\nopt-in rather than opt-out, we ensure that only those looking to use those extra\nservices have to deal with the added level of centralization they require. \n\nHardware wallet integration Another widely-requested feature from some of our\nmost security-conscious community members, building hardware integration into\nParticl Desktop will let you connect your favorite hardware wallet (i.e.,\nTrezor, Ledger Nano) and manage the funds it contains without having to use a\nseparate Particl wallet (Particl-Qt). This will let you use Particl Desktop, and\nits applications, without having to make security compromises. \n\nMarketing\nAs for marketing, our plans remain in line with what we’ve recently announced a\nfew weeks ago in our marketing blog post\n[https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/]. Indeed, we intend to\nkeep on gradually ramping up various marketing and outreach efforts as our line\nof products expands and as the barriers to adoption are taken down by the\nrelease of new key features.\n\nHowever, we are planning for a bigger marketing push related to the full release\nof BasicSwap. As we’ve mentioned in the past, we are highly confident in the\nimpact this upcoming DEX will have on the project, not only because of its\nobvious usefulness for the project but also because of the added exposure it\nwill bring to the ecosystem.\n\nDon’t forget, trading is still the number one use-case for cryptocurrencies and\nit’s becoming harder to trade by the day as most exchanges are becoming\nincreasingly restrictive; the release of BasicSwap comes at a very opportune\ntime and will fix a lot of the issues traders face nowadays.\n\nHow to Vote\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this Particl Wiki tutorial\n   [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.

Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock 100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security deposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%.

Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, <strong>the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\"><strong>Funding Distribution Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an ever-evolving situation.</p><p>For more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by following <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\">this link</a></strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">New Roadmap Revealed (2021)</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn about the next critical steps forward.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/62859ff1f762453131dee5a6d2c3d04b/medium-roadmap-particl-2021.jpg\"></div></a></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>General</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022. With its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and publicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other level, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s general adoption and exposure within the space.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck2\">Web framework</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl applications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser without the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to download any application.

We will be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are likely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at once.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock 100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security deposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from marketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and use-cases.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck3\">A ton of general improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Aside from the two major additions mentioned above, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added to Particl Marketplace.

Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors.

We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet.

They would make it possible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and purchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain and SMSG network. The early versions of these gateways are expected to be relatively basic but will serve as a good showcase of what the web framework will ultimately allow.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>Desktop</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat7_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat7_chck1\">SMSG controller integration</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            The SMSG controller is more of a back-end deliverable that improves how Particl applications interact with the SMSG network.

While Particl itself is entirely decentralized, these opt-in modules provide useful features that might require third-parties to get involved. By being opt-in rather than opt-out, we ensure that only those looking to use those extra services have to deal with the added level of centralization they require.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat7_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat7_chck3\">Hardware wallet integration</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Another widely-requested feature from some of our most security-conscious community members, building hardware integration into Particl Desktop will let you connect your favorite hardware wallet (i.e., Trezor, Ledger Nano) and manage the funds it contains without having to use a separate Particl wallet (Particl-Qt).

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
