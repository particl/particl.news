This would make\nboth of them much easier to use, more flexible, secure, private, and, perhaps\nmore importantly, set the stage for getting adoption from a broader range of\naudiences. This major and long-awaited upgrade is what is now known as “Particl\nV3”. \n\nWe are excited to announce, today, that Particl V3 is going live, on mainnet, on\nthe 29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC! \n\nThanks to all of you in the community for your support, time, passion,\nexperience, and dedication in helping out, testing, and engaging in constructive\nconversations that help shape the future of e-commerce and personal liberties.\nYou are what makes Particl's mission possible; our hats are off to you!\n\nNow let's go over a few basic information you need to know in preparation for\nthe mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhere will it be available?\nParticl V3 refers to the new Particl Desktop (3.0.0) client which gives access\nto the new Particl Marketplace and community governance module. And so, to use\nthe marketplace, you will need to install the latest version of Particl Desktop,\nwhich will be available on the official Particl website\n[https://particl.io/downloads] and the project’s Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] on the 29th of September\n2021 at 12:00 UTC.\n\nWhat can I do to prepare?\nFinalize open orders on previous versions of the marketplace\nParticl V3 is the biggest update to Particl ever since the project was launched\nin 2017. And because the scope of the changes is so large, orders and listings\ncreated on previous versions won't be compatible with Particl V3.\n\nFor this reason, we highly recommend finalizing any open marketplace order on\nprevious versions. But don’t worry, if you have open orders that you cannot\ncomplete at this moment (i.e., the escrow smart-contract is still locked),\nyou’ll be able to switch between Particl Desktop 2.x.x and Particl 3.x.x freely,\nat any time, to finalize orders even if you’ve started using Particl V3.\n\nSpread the good word around you\nWith the long-anticipated Particl V3 release now having an official mainnet\nrelease date, now’s the time to inform people around you and talk about all the\nbenefits that private and unrestricted e-commerce without middlemen offers.\n\nTo support your communication efforts after the release, you'll be able to point\npotential newcomers to the Particl Academy.\n\nThe Particl Academy is Coming!\nTo support the mainnet release of Particl V3, the Particl Academy will launch on\nthe same day (29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC).\n\nThe Particl Academy is your guide to becoming an expert in distributed\ne-commerce with Particl Marketplace. It gives you all the information you need\nto master Particl V3 and the other components of the Particl ecosystem. It’s a\nthorough reference book written in simple and straightforward language that\nanybody can understand.\n\nIf you show Particl to someone new, don’t forget to point them to the Particl\nAcademy! That'll let them quickly learn about it and guide them through their\nfirst steps.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we'd like to invite you to subscribe to our\nnewsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive\ncontent. \n\nAlong with the Particl V3 mainnet release, we are re-initiating our newsletter\ncommunication.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
