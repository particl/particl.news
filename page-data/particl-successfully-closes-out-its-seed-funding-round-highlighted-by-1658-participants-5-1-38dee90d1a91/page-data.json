First, we\nheard from long-time SDC holders who missed out on the funding round because of\nwithdrawal limits on the exchanges their tokens were banked. Then community\nmessages from SDC holders with tokens still on sites who wanted directions or a\nsimple walk-thru explaining the exchange process, only to find out the funding\nperiod was over. Lastly, emails came in from SDC holders wanting to remove\ntokens off exchanges and couldn’t generate addresses (because the exchange\nperiod had ended) so instead were sending SDC to the token exchange address\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/sdc/address.dws?SUaqjDUwAuVKnmWUX5tgU3fK1PkmbdfVCD.htm] \nin hopes it would convert to PART.\n\nNeedless to say, conversation surrounding the fate of SDC was being discussed\neverywhere long before April 15th arrived. While we probably will never be able\nto trace the full 23% what we do know is that roughly 1 million SDC were spread\nout on several exchanges when the token seed round ended. And though the Particl\nteam was communicating to exchanges through the funding round, nobody\nanticipated that amount would remain on exchanges for a project no longer being\nactively developed\n[https://blog.shadowproject.io/2017/03/17/particl-a-new-platform/].\n\nCommunity Driven — Community Shared\nEarly signs of community initiative is strong within Particl and I’m proud to\nshare the result of the constructive debates happening daily throughout our\ncommunity channels.\n\nThe Particl community and team have stepped up to Create a Cause for long-term\nSDC holders that have missed the exchange window. We understand not everyone is\nlooking at their portfolio every day, and believe long-term holders should have\na second opportunity to claim PART.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo SDC Holder Left Behind! — A cause worth donating to!\nsource: usatoday.comBrief:\nThe goal of this cause is to create a reserve pool of PART that will provide an\nextended period of time for holders of SDC to exchange for PART. Funding for\nthis proposal will come from any donations made by the entire community who want\nto allocate a percentage of their bonus from the 80% distribution of unclaimed\nPART. Additional funding will come from a match by the foundation via the 20%\ndistribution it receives as part of the 80/20 split\n[https://particl.news/unclaimed-part-and-the-80-20-split-4f5190b0fab3]. Donating\nto this cause is purely optional, each user will have the option to opt-in\nwithin their dashboard.\n\nIndividuals on the Particl Team have already committed to donate at least 25%\nand in some cases 100% of their 80% distribution. These are all personal funds.\nIf every token holder were to pay forward 25% of the 80% distribution this would\nhelp build a significant reserve pool of PART available to claim. Again,\nchoosing to participate in this cause is 100% optional.\n\nParticl Foundation Match\nThe Particl Foundation would like to match all donations to a 20% rate with an\naggregate limit of 40,000 PART. In layman’s terms, if the donations for this\ncause reach 200,000 PART, the Particl Foundation will match with a maximum\ndonation of 40,000 PART. The funds for this match will come from the 20% bonus\nallocation it receives per the 80/20 split.\n\nMuch Flair Very Prestige\nOk, so it’s not a mobile with the Particl Market pre-installed, but it will make\nyou feel good! Token holders who donate to this cause will receive a flair\nassociated to their name and be recognized on a Supporters page with username\nand % donated displayed. An option to stay anonymous will also be available.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEligible SDC token holders: Group 1\nTHE PROCESS STARTS NOW\n * Anyone who contacted the Particl Team via email/reddit/slack/riot before\n   00:00 UTC on 19th April, 2017 are eligible for 2:1 (SDC:PART) conversion.\n * Anyone who has on-chain funds in SDC which have not moved since 00:00 UTC on\n   19th of April, 2017 are also eligible for 2:1 (SDC:PART) conversion.\n * Anyone who contacted the Particl Team since 00:00 UTC on 19th April, 2017 and\n   who has funds on exchange that haven’t moved since April 15th. These will be\n   reviewed on a case by case basis.\n\nProof of Ownership Requirements:\n * A signed message from the address holding the unconverted SDC will be\n   required or where the funds where held elsewhere we will require proof\n   including a live web-session so that a team member can validate these claims.\n   If your claim is approved you will be asked to deposit these into a new\n   holding address.\n * An audit of SDC tokens in the account at 00:00 UTC on 19th of April will be\n   conducted.\n\nEligible SDC token holders: Group 2\nProcess starts after mainnet (Optional based on more community\ndiscussion/feedback)\n * Any SDC held on chain or on exchanges which was bought or has moved on-chain\n   since 00:01 UTC on 19th of April, 2017\n\nIt is important that we cater to as many SDC users as possible, however, PART\ntoken holders and the community need to find a fair proposal which takes into\naccount all parties. This will be open for community feedback and we encourage\neveryone to come up with creative solutions. If you think you have a\nsolution/proposal, we’d love to hear from you in #suggestions\n[https://particl.slack.com/messages/C4N50NL9X/]. We will be gathering the good\nones and will let the token holders decide which is the best via voting once the\nmainnet is live.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestions:\nHow long does this cause run?\nThe cut off period is 00:00 UTC on 31st of December, 2017\n\nWhat happens to the donated PART tokens remaining in the pool at end of period?\n100% of remaining PART donated to this cause will be reserved for network voted\nProposals such as: community members promoting at an event, integration to third\nparty services etc.\n\nWhy April 19th, I thought the exchange ended on April 15th?\nDuring the Particl exchange the team was in contact with all exchanges. The team\nrequested trading to halt at the end of the exchange to allow token holders a\nchance to participate in PART. Trading on SDC continued through the funding\nperiod and held its 60-day median value until April 19th 00:00 UTC when it\nplunged in value due to delisting requirements. This timestamp artificially\ncreated a break in the cost of entry to PART.\n\nHow did you come up with the 2:1 ratio?\nSDC held it’s value at $1.50 to $1.70 throughout the token exchange time frame.\nParticipants who exchanged during the 4 week window could exchange 1:1 which\nheld the market price value or exchange at 1:1.15 (15% bonus) which was below\nmarket price value in the 1st half of the 4 weeks and over $2 per PART in the\n2nd half of the 4 weeks. In order to protect our seed investor’s portfolio, a\nvalue of $3 per PART or 2:1 has been determined.","html":"<p><strong>This is an important blog post and we encourage everyone to share immediately wherever you can.</strong></p><p>The messages began to reach us soon after the April 15th deadline.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
