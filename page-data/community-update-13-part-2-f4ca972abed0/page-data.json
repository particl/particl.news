There, the\nteam demonstrated the long-awaited Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet, for the\nfirst time ever and was able to make a huge leap forward by connecting directly\nwith the crypto community.\n\nToward the Particl Open Marketplace\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nThe coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

In\ncomparison to Consensus, MCC aims to be the go-to conference for the true crypto\nfans and cypherpunks. It is an environment that is safe from all the corporate\ninfluence of Consensus and focuses on the tech moving forward. And magical it\nwas…\n\nDay 1 of MCC was Particl’s cupcake day. In fact, Particl saw its first\nsuccessful marketplace transaction take place on mainnet\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1127237342920675328]! This is an enormous\nmilestone for the project and it really started the week on the right foot,\nespecially as the whole process happened very smoothly and without any hiccup.\n\nBecause this event was mostly attended by long-time Bitcoin fans and people who\ngenerally don’t like the whole corporate/altcoin aspect of Consensus, we\nexpected to be met with skepticism and be put on the spot. However, we were\npleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl\nOpen Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the\nbooth.\n\nMax Keiser at the Particl boothUsually, most people don’t like when a platform\nis exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has\nproven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its\nnative coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain\nprivate, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to.\nThe ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform\nintended to be used by all crypto users.\n\nOne of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest\nfrom the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all,\nthe first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto\nusers, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.\n\nWe can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors,\ndevelopers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore\ncrypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable\nfeedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to\nshowcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical\nCrypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure\nand is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!\n\nConsensus\nWhereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know\nabout the Open Marketplace, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] meant business!\n\nAs you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty\nexpensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping\n$1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people,\nmaking the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This\nactually turned out to be a good thing.\n\nLike many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the\nprevious edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing\naround for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a\nsour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical\nCrypto Conference was created in the first place.\n\nSmaller but Better Crowd\nThis year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The\nquality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts\nand figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto\nfans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives,\nmany team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all\nresulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain\nsolutions could disrupt their respective industries.\n\nAnd as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team.\nIt has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major\nvendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a\ntrustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact,\nwe have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of\nParticl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their\nbusinesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with\nthem.\n\nDisrupting of Supply Chains\nParticl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers\nand vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what\nsome of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that\nthe Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow\nsystem, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how\nsupply chains operate in a major way.\n\nThe Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by\ngetting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely\nmoving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various\napplications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply\nchains, hiding R&D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading\ngoods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.\n\nFrom all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed\nto be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the\nOpen Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely\navoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely\ngroundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.\n\nSeeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one\nof the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.\n\nGreat Connections\nAside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve\nhad quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the\nspace, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it\nless chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.\n\nWe are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and\nwe’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors\nthat have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.\n\nInsights Right From the Trenches\nNot only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those\ndiscussions have also been extremely insightful to the team. The fact that so\nmany people came with so many different backgrounds and areas of expertise, it\ngave us a lot of different perspectives and ways to see how Particl’s Open\nMarketplace could be used in real-life situations. Suffice to say, the potential\nof this marketplace extends much further than just being a cool marketplace for\ncrypto users.\n\nNYC Blockchain Week Recap\nThe NYC Blockchain Week may very well turn out to be a very impactful event for\nParticl. The Particl team is coming back home with a strong sense of mission\naccomplished. We’ve had the opportunity to meet with so many of the users we’re\nbuilding this platform for, collect a vast amount of feedback from them and get\ndecent exposure in the heart of crypto.\n\nThe whole team that attended the conferences feels like this entire week has\nbeen a solid validation of what we’ve known all along — Particl is a highly\ndisruptive marketplace that looks and feels right. The only difference now is\nthat we’ve met some of the very people that need this marketplace the most, and\nwe are all as motivated and optimistic about the future of this project as we’ve\never been!\n\nA Rare Working Blockchain Product\nOnce again, just like the few recent conferences we’ve attended, Particl seemed\nto be among the minority of booths with a working product on display. This was\nsomething that impressed a lot of people.\n\nSometimes, the booth would be so busy that you would need to explain Particl a\nbit further away from the computers. Then, when the person would ask for a video\ndemo, they’d be completely surprised to learn that we actually had a working\nversion of it on mainnet just a few meters away. This was a reaction we’ve seen\ntime and time again, people are still not used to the fact that a blockchain\nproduct could be live on mainnet, and look so damn good.\n\nBest Testing Ground\nOne very interesting aspect of our week in NYC was the fact that for the entire\nduration of the two conferences we’ve attended, the Particl Open Marketplace has\nbeen thoroughly tested on mainnet and under many different circumstances. We\nhave observed no issue whatsoever, and we feel very confident moving forward\nwith this product.\n\nWhat Now?\nWe want to continue traveling the world and keep reaching out to more people.\nWe’ve also made great friendships and connections with people in the space with\nwhom we want to keep spending time with. This is the reason why we’ll actively\nbe looking around at other conferences and keep an eye out for any interesting\nevent.\n\nAs such, we likely will have a few team members going to San Francisco on the\n25th and 26th of June for the Bitcoin2019 conference\n[https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/]. We will announce more details shortly,\nbut if you are planning on going as well, definitely drop us a message and let’s\ntry to meet up at the conference!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the NYC Blockchain Week Recap part of this Community Update.

We’ve met vendors, developers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore crypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable feedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to showcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical Crypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure and is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!</p><h2 id=\"consensus\">Consensus</h2><p>Whereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know about the Open Marketplace, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019\"><strong>Consensus</strong></a> meant business!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-nARXbCJNMcUjiJmrCPgKWQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty expensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping $1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people, making the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This actually turned out to be a good thing.</p><p>Like many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the previous edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing around for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a sour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical Crypto Conference was created in the first place.</p><h3 id=\"smaller-but-better-crowd\">Smaller but Better Crowd</h3><p>This year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The quality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts and figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto fans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives, many team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all resulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain solutions could disrupt their respective industries.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-voIPMRhL2RfDNElVliA1gg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>And as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team. It has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major vendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a trustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact, we have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of Particl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their businesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with them.</p><h3 id=\"disrupting-of-supply-chains\">Disrupting of Supply Chains</h3><p>Particl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers and vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what some of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that the Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow system, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how supply chains operate in a major way.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-I9y28fq0kQ51wJolPi9_SQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by getting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely moving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various applications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply chains, hiding R&#x26;D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading goods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.</p><p>From all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed to be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the Open Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely avoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely groundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.</p><p>Seeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one of the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.</p><h3 id=\"great-connections\">Great Connections</h3><p>Aside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve had quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the space, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it less chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.</p><p>We are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and we’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors that have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.</p><h3 id=\"insights-right-from-the-trenches\">Insights Right From the Trenches</h3><p>Not only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those discussions have also been extremely insightful to the team. The fact that so many people came with so many different backgrounds and areas of expertise, it gave us a lot of different perspectives and ways to see how Particl’s Open Marketplace could be used in real-life situations. Suffice to say, the potential of this marketplace extends much further than just being a cool marketplace for crypto users.</p><h2 id=\"nyc-blockchain-week-recap-1\">NYC Blockchain Week Recap</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-kklvFWzk6Lnrc3O84nW5tw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The NYC Blockchain Week may very well turn out to be a very impactful event for Particl. <strong>The Particl team is coming back home with a strong sense of mission accomplished.</strong> We’ve had the opportunity to meet with so many of the users we’re building this platform for, collect a vast amount of feedback from them and get decent exposure in the heart of crypto.</p><p>The whole team that attended the conferences feels like this entire week has been a solid validation of what we’ve known all along — Particl is a highly disruptive marketplace that looks and feels right. The only difference now is that we’ve met some of the very people that need this marketplace the most, and we are all as motivated and optimistic about the future of this project as we’ve ever been!</p><h3 id=\"a-rare-working-blockchain-product\">A Rare Working Blockchain Product</h3><p>Once again, just like the few recent conferences we’ve attended, Particl seemed to be among the minority of booths with a working product on display. This was something that impressed a lot of people.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-MTndfC0uAEaLX8b4w9Re5A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Sometimes, the booth would be so busy that you would need to explain Particl a bit further away from the computers. Then, when the person would ask for a video demo, they’d be completely surprised to learn that we actually had a working version of it on mainnet just a few meters away. This was a reaction we’ve seen time and time again, people are still not used to the fact that a blockchain product could be live on mainnet, and look so damn good.</p><h3 id=\"best-testing-ground\">Best Testing Ground</h3><p>One very interesting aspect of our week in NYC was the fact that for the entire duration of the two conferences we’ve attended, the Particl Open Marketplace has been thoroughly tested on mainnet and under many different circumstances. We have observed no issue whatsoever, and we feel very confident moving forward with this product.</p><h3 id=\"what-now\">What Now?</h3><p>We want to continue traveling the world and keep reaching out to more people. We’ve also made great friendships and connections with people in the space with whom we want to keep spending time with. This is the reason why we’ll actively be looking around at other conferences and keep an eye out for any interesting event.</p><p>As such, we likely will have a few team members going to <a href=\"https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/\"><strong>San Francisco on the 25th and 26th of June for the Bitcoin2019 conference</strong></a>. We will announce more details shortly, but if you are planning on going as well, definitely drop us a message and let’s try to meet up at the conference!</p><hr><p>This concludes the NYC Blockchain Week Recap part of this Community Update.

us, now is the time to entirely focus on the\nmainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nIn a progress update posted on Discord on the 1st of May, we’ve mentioned that\nthe team was pretty much done with the integration of the blind escrow and was\nrunning automated tests on the OMP Library integration.\n\nIf you would like to read the other parts of this Community Update, simply\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * NYC Blockchain Week Recap\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-2-f4ca972abed0]\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Mainnet Release Timeline\nSince Particl has updated its core to 0.18 just 13 days ago\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7], we would like\nto let you know exactly where we currently stand, what’s the current projected\nmainnet release timeline, and what to look out for in the next few days!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Marketplace Mainnet Release Roadmap\n * (1) Finish blind escrow integration (Done)\n * (2) Finish the OMP Library integration tests (In progress)\n * (3) Tweak Particl Desktop to integrate the OMP Library (Pending) -> ETA: 1–2\n   days\n * (4) Publish final testnet build to the community before mainnet release \n   (Pending) -> ETA: Approximately 1 week if all goes smoothly\n * (5) Mainnet release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinish the Blind Escrow Integration (Done)\nDuring the last few weeks, the team had the opportunity to integrate the blind\nescrow in full and make a series of critical tweaks to the OMP Library just\nbefore releasing the marketplace on mainnet. The OMP Library was written some\ntime ago by Particl’s developer Kewde, but the team wanted to make some\nmodifications to it and run proper testing, specifically related to the buy\nflow, before putting it onto mainnet.\n\nThe OMP Library is a major improvement to the backend of the Particl Open\nMarketplace, allowing for example escrows to process transactions automatically\nusing Confidential Transactions or for listings to have more attributes.\n\nWe are happy to say that the integration of the blind escrow system into the\nmarketplace is now complete.\n\nFinish the OMP Library Integration Tests (In Progress)\nThe next step is to finalize the OMP Library integration by running the whole\nsuite of automated tests the team has built over the last two years. These\nautomated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break\nthem in any possible way.\n\nWhen a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be\nupdated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until\nit finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results,\nwe would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until\nafter these tests are complete.\n\nWe initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC\nBlockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the\nconferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead\nMarketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open\nMarketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason\nwhy we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it\nback home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the\nfinal testnet build before the first mainnet release.\n\nNote that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To\nthe contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a\nmajority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a\nclear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We\nactually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will\ncommunicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.\n\nWhy are These Tests so Important?\nThese automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes\nParticl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put\nout in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it\nis as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.\n\nThe tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components.\nIn fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved\nonto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there\nwill always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a\nhuge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the\nsecurity of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while\nit’s on the track racing.\n\nTake the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the\nseller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds\nlocked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that\ncould potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can\nimagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet\nenvironment!\n\n> Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track\nracing. — Joe Fisher\nThat doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after\nit launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time\nconsuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and\nare fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of\ntesting before unleashing on mainnet.\n\nThis is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet\nrelease.\n\nIntegrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)\nOnce the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate\nthe last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick\nto complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the\nbackend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works\nflawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the\nintegration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to\nParticl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy\nflow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.\n\nLast Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)\nAs soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the\ncommunity, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release\nof the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nBecause the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few\nmonths, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the\nimportant thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as\nthey will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being\nreleased on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.\n\nNevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet\nclient before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be\nrunning a short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500\nworth of PART to the best bug hunters out there! We will reveal all of the\ndetails once we publish the testnet build.\n\nWe estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a\nduration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard\ndate, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major\nissue arises.\n\nThen, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live\non mainnet will be upon us!\n\nMainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\nThis is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open\nMarketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto\nmainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with\nreal funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet\nrun of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.\n\nSo When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?\nAt this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that\nthe tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed\nwithin a pretty short time frame of a few days, though. Then, once it’s done, 1\nto 2 days will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last\ntestnet will be released to the public for a period of approximately 1 week, if\nall goes smoothly. We definitely want and will communicate a more precise\ntimeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library\nintegration tests. However, this development update should still be able to give\nyou a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.\n\nIn the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at\nthe Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to maximize the exposure of\nthe mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in\nlight of the new contacts we’ve made.\n\nAfter nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there! All\nfeatures intended to be part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nhave been integrated and are going through their final automated testing rounds.\nAlthough we are not able to give a definitive date for the mainnet release\ntoday, we will be communicating one very shortly.\n\nHang tight because from here on out, things will get very interesting!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews Flash: Particl Bulletproofs Audit by Quarkslab\nOn a non-marketplace related note, we are pleased to announce that Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] has started auditing our Bitcoin-based\nBulletproofs integration. Quarkslab is a world-renowned security firm having\naudited codes and projects like OpenSSL\n[https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/], \nVeraCrypt\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/veracrypt-audit-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities,32878.html]\n, OpenVPN [https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-assessment-of-openvpn.html], and,\ninterestingly enough, Monero’s Bulletproofs implementation\n[https://blokt.com/news/monero-fixes-all-bulletproof-protocol-vulnerabilities-found-in-second-security-audit]\n.\n\nOnce the audit is done, we’ll look into the report, address any potential issue\nit identifies, and start planning ahead for a hardfork of Particl’s RingCT with\nBulletproofs on mainnet.\n\nWe will keep you informed as details come in!\n\nWelcome — Quarkslab [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\nEvery security issue is different, every solution must be\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]www.quarkslab.com [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming up?\nWith all the intended features for the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nbeing integrated, part of the development team has now started working on the\nnext features that will be integrated into the marketplace. Note that none of\nthese new features will be included in the first mainnet version of the Open\nMarketplace. As the build is pretty stable right now, we do not want to\nintegrate new functions that could delay the mainnet release.\n\nQuantity Management\nA must-have for vendors running a business out of their sales. Quantity\nManagement is like a lite version of the full Inventory Management system we\nplan on integrating later during the Beta phase of development. It allows\nvendors to set quantities for their listings and lets people bid multiple times\non the same listings if the vendors set their quantity accordingly.\n\nFuture Features\nThe Particl team also has other features it would like to focus on first after\nthe mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. We still want to go through a few\nother development meeting sessions before communicating what other features\nother than Quantity Management will be worked on first. We will let you know all\nof the information after the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the Development Update part of this Community Update.

These automated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break them in any possible way.</p><p>When a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be updated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until it finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results, we would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until after these tests are complete.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-3/1-kumyXfSTRhXArYocWrrNHw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>We initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC Blockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the conferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead Marketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open Marketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason why we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it back home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release.</p><p>Note that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To the contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a majority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a clear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We actually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will communicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.</p><h3 id=\"why-are-these-tests-so-important\">Why are These Tests so Important?</h3><p>These automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes Particl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put out in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it is as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.</p><p>The tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components. In fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved onto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the marketplace.</p><p>In fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there will always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a huge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the security of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while it’s on the track racing.</p><p>Take the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the seller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds locked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that could potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can imagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet environment!</p><blockquote>Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track racing. — Joe Fisher</blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after it launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time consuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and are fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of testing before unleashing on mainnet.</p><p>This is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet release.</p><h3 id=\"integrate-the-omp-library-into-particl-desktop-pending-\">Integrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)</h3><p>Once the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate the last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick to complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the backend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works flawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the integration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to Particl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy flow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.</p><h3 id=\"last-testnet-build-before-mainnet-pending-\">Last Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)</h3><p>As soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the community, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace!</p><p>Because the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few months, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the important thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as they will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being released on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.</p><p>Nevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet client before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be running a <strong>short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500 worth of PART to the best bug hunters out there</strong>! We will reveal all of the details once we publish the testnet build.</p><p>We estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a duration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard date, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major issue arises.</p><p>Then, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live on mainnet will be upon us!</p><h3 id=\"mainnet-release-of-the-open-marketplace-pending-\">Mainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)</h3><p>This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto mainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with real funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet run of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.</p><h3 id=\"so-when-is-it-coming-out-on-mainnet-exactly\">So When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-3/1-MOqFHxGVVDtIDKXSgp-XCg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that the tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed within a pretty short time frame of <strong>a few days</strong>, though. Then, once it’s done, <strong>1 to 2 days</strong> will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last testnet will be released to the public for a period of <strong>approximately 1 week, </strong>if all goes smoothly. <strong>We definitely want and will communicate a more precise timeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library integration tests. </strong>However, this development update should still be able to give you a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.</p><p>In the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at the Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to <strong>maximize the exposure</strong> of the mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in light of the new contacts we’ve made.</p><p><strong>After nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there!

Whereas last year was focused on building the base\nlayer for the Open Marketplace, this year has been all about refining it and\nstarting to add new features on top of it. That doesn’t mean, however, that the\nonly milestones reached this year were about the marketplace! Here’s a complete\nlist of all the accomplishments and deliverables Particl had so far this year:\n\nParticl Copay 5.4.1 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44] (Jan 17th): A\nnew version of Particl Copay was released on the 17th of January and marked a\nrenewed active development for Particl’s mobile application. This update has\nbeen a major overhaul of the mobile application. It upgraded the application’s\ncodebase, introduced a slew UI/UX and security improvements, fixed a couple of\nminor bugs, and enabled multi-currency support. This major Particl Copay update\nwas pushed to set the stage for a bigger Particl Copay update that came a few\nweeks after: mobile multi-signature cold staking.\n\nParticl Copay 5.4.1 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44]\nYesterday, we released the 5.4.1 version of Particl Copay which sets the\nParticl\nmobile application to the latest Copay…\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44]\n\nParticl Copay Released on iOS\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-now-available-on-ios-3a1c8ebb4b] (Jan 24th): \nParticl Copay was finally released on iOS on the 24th of January.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the\nnetwork as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the\nfunctioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing\nmessages around the network and make the governance system work.

While we initially intended to move entirely on Discord and put\nTelegram in read-only mode, our travels around the world have made it clear we\ncouldn’t do that as some countries exclusively use Telegram. Nevertheless, the\nteam has been mostly moved over there and our Discord server will be the main\nplatform we’ll focus on moving forward even though we will keep our Telegram\nchannel open.\n\nParticl is Officially Moving to Discord\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nThe Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever\nsince\nwe abandoned Slack more than a year…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\n\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d] \n(March 8th): On the 8th March, Particl reached a big milestone by releasing its\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on testnet.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big\nconference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and\nintroducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community.\nNot only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also\nproved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major\nconferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto\nConference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace\nwould be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect\nour commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first\nmainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions\nenabled by default.\n\nAdditionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the\nBitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after\nBitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the\nrelease of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of\ntime the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the\nescrow mechanism.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the network as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the functioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing messages around the network and make the governance system work. The hardfork went through without any issue and the network is now ready for the mainnet release of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83\"><strong>Hardfork Successful</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83\"><em>?

While we initially intended to move entirely on Discord and put Telegram in read-only mode, our travels around the world have made it clear we couldn’t do that as some countries exclusively use Telegram. Nevertheless, the team has been mostly moved over there and our Discord server will be the main platform we’ll focus on moving forward even though we will keep our Telegram channel open.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\"><strong>Particl is Officially Moving to Discord</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\"><em>The Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever since we abandoned Slack more than a year…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\">particl.news</a></p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><strong>Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 Released</strong></a><strong> (March 8th):</strong> On the 8th March, Particl reached a big milestone by releasing its Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on testnet.

This release marked the completion of the base layer of the marketplace, meaning that the development team could now start focusing on adding features on top of it.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><strong>Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 Release &amp; Development Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><em>It’s finally here!

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference. The team made great connections at the event and was able to gather a lot of feedback which we’ve used since then to improve the look and feel of the product.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/token2049-a-recap-review-a29d28151e0e\"><strong>TOKEN2049: A Recap &amp; Review</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/token2049-a-recap-review-a29d28151e0e\"><em>It’s one week past the big event and by now, all Particl participants have safely made it back home.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the network as well as paid SMSG messages.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
