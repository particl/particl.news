In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week has seen only minor progress on Particl Desktop due to our desktop\ndeveloper being mostly unavailable. However, we expect desktop development pace\nto start picking up starting today.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nRemember that, in the interest of pushing updates more quickly and as the array\nof dependency updates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development\ndebts of the past few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with\nmost of the updates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent\nupdate (i.e., 3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n> Note: Particl Desktop development is currently being worked on on a part-time\nbasis, which is expected to result in slower development pace compared to Core\nor BasicSwap DEX. However, we expect to resume development of this department on\na full-time capacity in the near future.\nParticl Marketplace Moderation ?️\nIn our commitment to maintaining the safety and integrity of Particl\nMarketplace, we've resumed our research into a better, more efficient content\nmoderation system. Those familiar with the project know about the\nalready-existing crowdsourced moderation system which, while functional, is\nstill in its early stages and needs further refinement to effectively minimize\nexposure to undesirable content for the end-user while improving it's\npro-activity.\n\nModerating a decentralized marketplace without introducing central points of\nfailure is a real challenge. On one hand, it cannot put too much responsibility\non end-users, as that means they have to be constantly exposed to undesirable\ncontent so that they can vote it out. But on the other hand, it also cannot put\nthat responsibility into specific users, moderation staff, groups of people, or\norganizations, as that defeats the very purpose of a decentralized system and\nintroduces central points of failure and liability.\n\nOur proposed solution would leverage Particl's staking pools, voting delegation,\nand the potential of LLM (large language models) to more proactively moderate\ncontent. This innovative approach would allow for pre-screening based on\ncommunity-driven policies, removing inappropriate listings before they even\nreach users. The end result is a painless user experience that is free from\nundesirable content and doesn't require the end-user to act as a moderator and\nbe exposed to undesirable content.\n\nKeep in mind that this system is still theoretical, with ongoing research\nfocused on integrating LLM capabilities and refining the implementation strategy\nwithout any sacrifice to the level of decentralization or privacy. Once fully\ndeployed, this model could lead the way in terms of decentralized moderation\nwithout central points of failure or undue burden on users.\n\nWe will continue our research and provide a detailed update on Particl News once\nwe finalize the design. This approach, if successful, could set a precedent for\naddressing moderation challenges in decentralized environments without\nsacrifices to decentralization.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nSPV Integration ?\nWe've started looking into more extensive SPV functionalities to Particl Core,\nwhich will eventually enable more portable instances of Particl wallets.\n\nWe have no timeline or ETA on this item, but it has now been added to our list\nof deliverables. \n\nBasicSwap ?\nAs mentioned last week, we've been working on completing a few changes that\nintroduce fixes and improvements to the codebase.\n\nAs it currently stands, all items are now complete and undergoing testing within\nthe dev branch before they go live on the master branch.\n\n☑️ Fix error showing received bids for inactive coins\n☑️ Fix error when display old offers on v13\n☑️ Move protocol_version to the first field in protobuf definitions\n☑️️ Allow users to select which coins to show prices for on offers page\n☑️️ Move v13 from dev to master — not compatible with previous versions\n☑️ Change sending the rate over in bids to sending the amount_to\n☑️ Fix invalid amount error with large values\n\nDecred Integration ✅\nWe're still working on integrating Decred into BasicSwap, making satisfying\nprogress all throughout the week. Here is the relevant progress report in\nregards to that specific deliverable:\n\n☑️ Collect Decred chain parameters\n☑️ Encode and decode Decred addresses\n☑️ Call Decred RPC commands\n☑️ Start and manage DCR daemon from BasicSwap\n☑️ Start and manage DCR wallet from BasicSwap\n☑️ Validate Decred seed and wallet restoration\n☑️ Add extkey class to get from seed to account pubkey\n☑️ Add CTransaction class\n?

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, this time pivoting towards progressing on the\nvarious feature updates planned for it.\n\nIn the interest of pushing updates more quickly, and as the array of dependency\nupdates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development debts of the\npast few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with most of the\nupdates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent update (i.e.,\n3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n   \n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDecred Coming to BasicSwap DEX ✅\nWe are happy to announce that Decred, a pioneering cryptocurrency in atomic\nswap\ntechnology\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, will be integrated into BasicSwap in the coming weeks.\n\nIndeed, the Decred community has voted to support the team in coding the\nintegration of Decred into the DEX, ensuring its inclusion and access to all\ncurrent and future features, releases, and related products or services on\nBasicSwap.\n\nConsequently, we've begun work on the integration last weekend. Although Decred\nuses a UTXO codebase, its components are coded in Go, which requires the\ndevelopment of Go compatibility within certain components of the DEX. While this\nrequires additional effort, it should not present a major obstacle and are\nconfident that it will be integrated and ready for testing within the next few\nweeks.\n\nWownero Coming to BasicSwap DEX ✅\nCommunity member ofrnxmr has recently fundraised via both the Wownero and\nParticl communities to code an integration for Wownero, the Monero-derived\nmemecoin.\n\nWhile a couple of normal roadblocks have been encountered, steady progress is\nbeing made and we should soon see this new coin make its way onto the DEX. We\nare ready to review and merge the integration once ready.\n\nYou can follow ofrnxmr on Twitter [https://twitter.com/ofrnxmr] for updates\nregarding progress on that matter.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWhile a few things have diverted our attention from focusing exclusively on the\nGUI this week, we have continued work on the user interface, focusing on the New\nOffers page and still pushing changes to the Wallets and individual Coin Wallet\npages, but also adding the required assets to prepare for Decred's integration.\n\nKeep an eye out for updates being pushed to the dev branch on Github, and as\nalways, if you would like to test these changes before they make it into the \nmaster branch, you can change your active BasicSwap branch to the dev branch\n(using git checkout dev) and updating BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nas you would typically do for a regular update.\n\nInstallation Wizard V2 (Windows) Updates ?‍♂️\nWe're also preparing an update to the Windows installer based on a variety of\nfeedback and bug reports received from the community. The update is expected to\ngo live shortly.\n\nParticl x Litecoin MWEB Contest ?\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)Here’s your chance to win a 2013\nLealana 1 Litecoin physical coin worth nearly $1,000!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/]To celebrate the launch of\nLitecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX, we're giving away five (5) 2013 Lealana 1\nLitecoin physical coins, each one valued at nearly $1,000 USD, with only two\ncoins remaining.\n\nFor complete details on how to participate, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/] to our contest blog post.

Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, continuing to prioritize updating\ndependencies and addressing reported issues.\n\nWe expect this segment of the Particl Desktop 3.3.3 development to be the most\ntime-consuming, primarily due to the lag in updating dependencies caused by the\nsignificant pause in Particl Desktop development.\n\nOnce the dependency updates and issue resolutions are complete, we will shift\nour focus to the following items and release Particl Desktop 3.3.3 when they are\nwrapped up.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (in progress)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (in progress)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (in progress)\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nWe're happy to announce that Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer has\nofficially resumed work on Particl Desktop as of this week.\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks, you can expect many changes to be pushed\nto Particl Desktop, which will culminate into the three major deliverables that\nwe've mentioned last week, namely Particl Desktop 3.3.3, Particl Desktop 3.4,\nand the required changes to make Particl Desktop compatible with the\nhyper-private and secure TAILS OS.\n\nHas work only resumed now, we will have more details on the progress being made\nto the below items next week.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3.3\nThe most immediate desktop release will focus on minor fixes and items that were\nearmarked for it when development paused a few months ago.\n\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandonned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n * Investigate a potential problem with market identities and fix if issue is\n   found.\n * Investigate a potential issue with the editing functionality for Seller\n   Templates.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.4\nThe subsequent release will be almost exclusively focused on marketplace-related\nbug fixes and improvements. The goal with this update is to get the marketplace\nto a satisfactory level of stability and usability while we transition towards\nbuilding the new marketplace dApp.\n\n * Export Seller Templates to .csv file to easily migrate listings.\n * Allow for batch editing of listing details (i.e., shipping costs).\n * Improve publishing process of listings across different markets/identities.\n * Add an overriding functionality to the batch publish window.\n * Automate batch publishing (retries until all listings are successfully\n   published).\n * Add additional shipping options.\n * Allow Seller Templates to be sorted based on their attributes.\n * Increase character limit to listing description and titles.\n * Allow seller to delete or hide Seller Templates that aren't needed anymore.\n * Enable .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image files.\n\nParticl Desktop for TAILS OS\nAdditionally, we're exploring the requirements to make Particl Desktop\ncompatible with the hyper-private and amnesic TAILS Linux OS. While we have no\nspecific deliverables to announce regarding this, it seems likely that this will\nrequire a specific TAILS-focused version of Particl Desktop as it requires files\nto be managed differently so that it can work in conjunction with persistent\nmemory (i.e., storing required data like orders, Seller Templates, or the\nblockchain on a USB stick) more easily.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nWe announced that Particl Desktop development would resume shortly, and those\nplans are still on track for the 2 weeks approximation we gave last week. Today,\nwe're happy to share some of the deliverables we're exploring for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop releases.\n\n> Note: The items listed below are not set in stone. Some may be taken out and new\nitems may appear as we work on the upcoming releases.\nParticl Desktop 3.3.3\nThe most immediate desktop release will focus on minor fixes and items that were\nearmarked for it when development paused a few months ago.\n\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandonned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n * Investigate a potential problem with market identities and fix if issue is\n   found.\n * Investigate a potential issue with the editing functionality for Seller\n   Templates.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.4\nThe subsequent release will be almost exclusively focused on marketplace-related\nbug fixes and improvements. The goal with this update is to get the marketplace\nto a satisfactory level of stability and usability while we transition towards\nbuilding the new marketplace dApp.\n\n * Export Seller Templates to .csv file to easily migrate listings.\n * Allow for batch editing of listing details (i.e., shipping costs).\n * Improve publishing process of listings across different markets/identities.\n * Add an overriding functionality to the batch publish window.\n * Automate batch publishing (retries until all listings are successfully\n   published).\n * Add additional shipping options.\n * Allow Seller Templates to be sorted based on their attributes.\n * Increase character limit to listing description and titles.\n * Allow seller to delete or hide Seller Templates that aren't needed anymore.\n * Enable .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image files.\n\nParticl Desktop for TAILS OS\nAdditionally, we're exploring the requirements to make Particl Desktop\ncompatible with the hyper-private and amnesic TAILS Linux OS. While we have no\nspecific deliverables to announce regarding this, it seems likely that this will\nrequire a specific TAILS-focused version of Particl Desktop as it requires files\nto be managed differently so that it can work in conjunction with persistent\nmemory (i.e., storing required data like orders, Seller Templates, or the\nblockchain on a USB stick) more easily.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Here's a part of what we've worked\non this week:\n\n * Provide an alternative to secp256k1_clz64_var using HAVE_BUILTIN_CLZLL.\n * Add support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets.\n * Set the createoffers.py script's min_swap_amount variable to offer min bid\n   amount also (currently only used for bids).\n * Allow multiple signing keys to be tried with the basicswap-prepare script.\n * Set the state of expired bids to \"timed-out\".\n * \"Accept bid\" should be removed — like the \"abandon bid\" button — when not\n   it's not possible to accept (e.g., expired bid).\n\nUser Interface ?️\nThis week again, we've rolled out user interface updates to the dev branch which\nyou can now test.\n\nIf you would like to test these changes before they make it into the master \nbranch, you can change your active BasicSwap branch to the dev branch (using git\ncheckout dev) and updating BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nas you would typically do for a regular update.\n\nNotably, we've pushed changes to the way the order book is displayed that\nsimplify and make it more intuitive. More GUI updates coming next week!\n\nParticl x Litecoin MWEB Contest ?\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)Here’s your chance to win a 2013\nLealana 1 Litecoin physical coin worth nearly $1,000!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/]To celebrate the launch of\nLitecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX, we're giving away five (5) 2013 Lealana 1\nLitecoin physical coins, each one valued at nearly $1,000 USD, in a new contest\nthat starts today.\n\nFor complete details on how to participate, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/] to our contest blog post.

Here's a list of what we worked on\nthis week:\n\n * Expired bids to automatically transition to a \"Timed-Out\" status. \n * The option to \"Accept Bid\" should be hidden — similar to the \"Abandon Bid\"\n   button — when it is not possible to accept. \n * Integrate the automated market making script into BasicSwap's GUI and add the\n   ability to create Automation Strategies. \n * Improve the user interface for interacting with the automated market making\n   script and editing Automation Strategies. \n * Upgraded to the latest Firo core version. \n * Build a plugin for Hummingbot (to-do/research). \n * Ensure that remote_daemon_urls is displayed in settings when \n   automatically_select_daemon is enabled. \n * Correct the issue where automatic selection of XMR nodes defaults to using\n   the last RPC host/port. \n * Implement \"order stacking\" to aggregate offers of identical value on the\n   order book, thus improving the clarity and efficiency of the way offers are\n   displayed.\n\nNew Firo Core Update ?\nWe've pushed Firo's latest core update on BasicSwap, meaning that you can now\nupdate its core and run the latest version.

thrilled to announce a major milestone: the initial phase of integrating\nLitecoin MWEB into BasicSwap DEX. With this latest update, users now have the\nability to send MWEB transactions to MWEB deposit addresses on BasicSwap and\neffortlessly convert coins between standard and MWEB balances.\n\nThis integration marks the first step in our commitment to fully integrate\nLitecoin MWEB atomic swaps into BasicSwap DEX. We are closely following\nLitecoin's upcoming major update — which is required for a full integration of\nMWEB swaps — and plan to incorporate full MWEB swaps as soon as feasible. \n\nOur goal is to support innovation in the cryptocurrency space, especially in\nregards to privacy, data protection, and pro-freedom initiatives, and we are\nconfident that adding Litecoin's MWEB capabilities to our DEX will go a long way\nin making this important privacy contribution from the Litecoin community more\naccessible to a wider audience. \n\nTable of Contents\n * How to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\n * Providing Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\n * (Contest) Win a Physical Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)\n * Dr. Kap to Speak at the Litecoin Summit 2024\n * About Litecoin's MWEB\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\nTo begin using Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap, you need to either install the DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html] \non your computer or update it to the latest version\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n. Detailed instructions for installation and updating can be found at the \nParticl Academy [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/index.html].\n\n> Note: If you're using Windows, you can use our all-in-one .exe installer here\n[https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI] which fully\nautomates the process: \nhttps://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases (latest\ninstaller version)\nOnce installed, navigate to the Wallets page on the DEX where you'll see all the\ncoins you've enabled. To manage your Litecoin wallet, click on the 'Manage\nWallet' button at the top right corner of the Litecoin tile. There, you'll find\nboth your standard and MWEB Litecoin deposit addresses. You can send your coins\nto these addresses as needed.\n\nTo switch coins between standard and MWEB balances, simply make a withdrawal\nfrom one address type to the other. This will create an internal transaction,\neffectively converting your balance between the two states.\n\nFor example, to transfer coins from your standard deposit address to your MWEB\naddress, simply copy and paste your MWEB address into the LTC address field,\nenter the number of LTC you want to transfer, and click on the Withdraw LTC\nbutton.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProviding Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\nWhile full MWEB swaps aren't yet an option on BasicSwap, you still have the\nability to swap Litecoin using either the Secret Hash method or the more\nprivacy-centric Adaptor Signature protocol for atomic swaps. This means you can\ntrade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX,\nincluding Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.\n\nTo make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a \ncompanion automated market making script\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts]. This tool runs in\ntandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book\nonce they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market\nrate. \n\nAdditionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers\nwith a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for\npassive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.\n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the\ncompanion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is\nextremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your\ncomputer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your\npersonal computer.\n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in\noffsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other\npeople pick up your swap offers.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThe second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This\nallows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated\nmanner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\nand add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential passive\nincome whenever others pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node and providing liquidity to Litecoin pairs entirely effortless\nonce the initial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy\nthe market making script, and earn some sweet passive income as people enjoy\nyour liquidity for their swapping needs.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)\nTo celebrate the launch of Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX — the world's safest,\ncheapest and most anonymous decentralized exchange — we're giving away five (5) \n2013 Lealana 1 Litecoin “First Run” bullions, valued at approximately $1,000\neach\n[https://stacksbowers.com/cryptocurrency/litecoin-ltc/#:~:text=Overview%3A%20The%20Lealana%20Litecoin%20series,physical%20bitcoins%20introduced%20in%202011]\n.\n\nTo participate, simply (1) place a bid on the contest listing on Particl's\ndecentralized marketplace dApp (listing title: Particl x Litecoin MWEB Contest),\n(2) like and retweet the contest tweet, and (3) tag three of your friends in the\ntweet's comments section. The link to the tweet will be shared tomorrow in a\nblog post exclusively dedicated to the contest on Particl News\n[https://particl.news].\n\nWe will be picking a lucky winner at random every two Sundays over 10 weeks, for\n5 rounds total.\n\nMark your calendars for these draw dates (all at 2PM EST):\n\n 1.

Derived from the name 'MimbleWimble' originating from the\nHarry Potter series, this protocol was initially proposed by an anonymous user\nnamed Tom Elvis Jedusor in a Bitcoin research chatroom, signaling its roots in\nthe broader crypto community.\n\nTechnically, MWEB is distinct because it fundamentally alters how transactions\nare constructed in Litecoin's blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain models,\nwhere individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions\ninto a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential\ntransactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted.\nThe encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the\ntransaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel\napproach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to\nobscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.\n\nThe benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly\nenhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by\nobscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark\ncontrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin,\nwhere transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves\nscalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using\ncryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store\nexcessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the\nnetwork. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making\nLitecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This will create an internal transaction, effectively converting your balance between the two states.</p><p>For example, to transfer coins from your standard deposit address to your MWEB address, simply copy and paste your MWEB address into the LTC address field, enter the number of LTC you want to transfer, and click on the Withdraw LTC button.</p><hr><h2 id=\"providing-liquidity-to-litecoin-pairs\">Providing Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs</h2><p>While full MWEB swaps aren't yet an option on BasicSwap, you still have the ability to swap Litecoin using either the Secret Hash method or the more privacy-centric Adaptor Signature protocol for atomic swaps. This means you can trade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX, including Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.</p><p>To make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts\">companion automated market making script</a>. This tool runs in tandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book once they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market rate. </p><p>Additionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers with a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for passive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.</p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the companion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other people pick up your swap offers.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up.

This means you can trade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX, including Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.</p><p>To make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts\">companion automated market making script</a>. This tool runs in tandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book once they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market rate. </p><p>Additionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers with a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for passive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.</p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the companion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other people pick up your swap offers.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up.

Derived from the name 'MimbleWimble' originating from the Harry Potter series, this protocol was initially proposed by an anonymous user named Tom Elvis Jedusor in a Bitcoin research chatroom, signaling its roots in the broader crypto community.</p><p>Technically, MWEB is distinct because it fundamentally alters how transactions are constructed in Litecoin's blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain models, where individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions into a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential transactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted. The encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the transaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel approach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to obscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.</p><p>The benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly enhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by obscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark contrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin, where transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves scalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store excessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the network. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making Litecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

Please follow the instructions provided here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nto update your BasicSwap to the latest version.\n\nWe're now ready to officially launch Litecoin MWEB balances, so stay tuned for\nan official announcement about it next week!\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nAhead of the Litecoin MWEB release, we've rolled out a minor update (currently\nunder the dev Github branch) to BasicSwap's GUI that improves the display of\ninformation on the order book and includes several refinements to the Wallets\npage. This update will hit the master branch shortly next week before\nBasicSwap's Litecoin MWEB release.\n\nWe're also preparing for more comprehensive updates to the GUI as part of the\nbroader version 2.1, which we expect to release shortly.\n\nMiscellaneous ✅\nWe've also made a series of improvements and bug fixes to the DEX.\n\n * Set min_relay_fee for Litecoin.\n * Failing reverse bids at checkQueuedActions now set to \"Error\".\n * Console page does not offer option for XMR / MWEB wallets anymore if they are\n   not enabled.\n * Propagate errors from checkQueuedActions (in progress).\n * Updated the dependencies and the install script.\n * Added delay to time delay settings.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDr. Kap's Privacy Hour ⌚️\nThe second episode of Dr. Kap's Privacy Hour has been published on our YouTube\nchannel and you can watch it right here using the embedded player just below.\n\nDon't miss out on future episodes – they will be broadcast live on X Spaces and\nthen re-uploaded to our YouTube channel shortly thereafter.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, that we are observing a delay that is impacting the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we are working on resolving.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nWork on 26.x Codebase Begins ?️\nWe've also begun work on Particl Core 26.x. Based off of Bitcoin's 26.x\ncodebase, it introduces experimental support for the v2 transport protocol as\ndefined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 324 (BIP324).\n\nWhile it is uncertain yet when we will be ready to release it, you can read more \nhere\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/06/bitcoin-cores-v260-upgrade-aims-to-impede-eavesdropping-tampering/]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we experienced a bit of a slowdown in regards to BasicSwap DEX due to\na particular bug we encountered during testing of some of the components\nincluded in the upcoming GUI update (v2.1). The bug affected the readability of\nSMSG messages when the decryption of an encrypted wallet failed, resulting in\noffers not appearing as expected on the order book. We have now fully resolved\nthis issue, although it took a considerable amount of time to diagnose.\n\nIt's important to note that while this bug posed no risk to user funds or\nsecurity, it did have a significant impact on the user experience when\ntriggered. To ensure the best possible experience on BasicSwap DEX, we recommend\nupdating to the latest version.
