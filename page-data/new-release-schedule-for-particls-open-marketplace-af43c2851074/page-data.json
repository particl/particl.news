It was the first blockchain to \nnatively integrate Segwit and have it enabled for all of its transactions, the\nfirst project to integrate RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase\nother than Cryptonote), the first project to implement\n[https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d]\nConfidential\nTransactions (CT)\n[https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d] on\nBitcoin’s codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d] and push it\nonto mainnet, the first project to implement\n[https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34]cold\nstaking [https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34] \nfor its entire mainnet network, and the first project to enable a true PoS (not \ndPoS [https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/] or \ndBFT [https://thebitcoinnews.com/what-is-delegated-byzantine-fault-tolerance/])\ncoin to safely cold stake from a hardware device\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae] \n(Ledger Nano S). To make all of this a reality, the Particl developers have been\nproducing a lot of high-quality code, earning the team a spot within the top\ntiers of several Github audit reports/reviews\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAll of these achievements are surely impressive, especially coming from a team\nthat’s relatively quite small compared to other projects producing similar\namount [http://coincodecap.com] and quality of code (a look at the contributors\nsection of this code quality ranking [http://coincodecap.com] tells everything\nyou need to know). But what this story fails to mention is that none of the\naccomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the\nproject, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product. In\nfact, all of them exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the security,\nprivacy, stability, and scalability of the network in prevision for the mainnet\nrelease of Particl’s first application: the Open Marketplace.\n\nThe Open Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is a product that’s been in the making for quite some time\nand has proven to be a huge undertaking due to its extremely ambitious nature.\n\nIn short, it is an entirely trustless marketplace with full privacy baked in by\ndefault and with almost no fee at all. The fact that it is trustless means that\nit can function autonomously and without any third-party having to get involved\nat any point in time. This allows fees to be brought down to the bare minimum\nand completely eliminates the trust factor involved when making online sales and\npurchases.\n\nIts privacy aspect, which probably is the most groundbreaking aspect of the Open\nMarketplace, makes it so that all purchases and sales you make are verifiably\nprivate/anonymous. Whatever you do within the platform generates no identifiable\ndata at all, meaning that it can’t be harvested by Particl or any other\nthird-party other than the one you are transacting with. In other words, nothing\nyou do on Particl’s Open Marketplace can leave any trace behind.\n\nThis privacy aspect truly is a revolution within the eCommerce industry, an\nindustry that has made its fortune preying on its own users by collecting their\ndata, without their consent, in order to get profits and influence.\n\nThe simple fact that no other project has ever attempted to build a completely\ntrustless marketplace with rock solid privacy built directly at its core speaks\nabout the complexity of the task. Being the first at doing something also means\nvery few examples and proofs-of-concept are out there to help pave the way\nforward, but it also means that you can create a niche audience around your “new\nway” and capitalize on it!\n\nEven though a lot of development progress has been made to the Open Marketplace\nin 2018, the fact it has only been operable on testnet for the entire year has\nmade people more eager than ever to see some kind of mainnet release and finally\nget their hands on a working version of this groundbreaking technology.\n\nMainnet is Finally Upon Us!\nThe days where the Open Marketplace is only available as a testnet product are\ncoming to an end. We’ve stated in the past we wanted this year to be different\nin nature from the previous one, and so let’s start it with a bang! Whereas 2018\nwas solely focused on development, 2019 will see much more action with the\nrelease of the Open Marketplace on mainnet. The best part? The mainnet release\nof the Alpha version of Particl’s Open Marketplace is now imminent!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Timeline\nAs stated in an answer\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-1-fe6a3f3014c2#3a6d] to a\nquestion asked during our latest AMA/FAQ session, one of the decisions the\nParticl team has taken in South Africa has been to focus on making the current\nAlpha version of the marketplace completely stable and move it onto mainnet as\nsoon as that stability is reached. In other words, in just a short time, it will\nfinally be possible to buy and sell real goods and services on Particl’s Open\nMarketplace and do it with real coins!\n\nAlpha Development Phase Ends and Releases on Mainnet\nThe current Alpha version contains all the necessary tools for basic eCommerce\nto be possible, including weighted decentralized governance to keep it clean\n(which is currently available internally, but is not merged on public testnet\njust yet). Once Alpha is successfully moved onto mainnet, it will mark the end\nof the Alpha period for the Open Marketplace and the beginning of the Beta\nphase.\n\nAlpha Mainnet Features\nIf you’ve played with recent versions of the marketplace on testnet, then you\nwill find yourself within a familiar environment when running it on mainnet. All\nof the features introduced throughout the year on testnet will now be available,\nand very stable, within a real-life environment. There is no better way to test\nfeatures, especially those relying on game-theory such as the MAD escrow and the\ndecentralized governance mechanism, than to put them into the wild where real\nfunds and incentives are involved.\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that, as the current switch from testnet\nto mainnet won’t require any sort of hardfork, the first mainnet version of the\nOpen Marketplace won’t process transactions using Particl’s RingCT protocol \nwhich will stay on testnet for the time being. What this means is that \nmarketplace transactions will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is\nfully implemented into the escrow system at some point in time during Beta’s\ndevelopment phase.\n\nThe mainnet version of the Open Marketplace Alpha will contain these features:\n\n * Buy and sell real products and services with real coins\n * Trustless and fee-less escrow mechanism without RingCT privacy\n * Decentralized governance mechanism to flag listings\n * Community proposals\n\nBeta Development Phase Begins Soon (Testnet)\nWhile the Alpha mainnet version of the marketplace will allow anyone in the\nworld to buy and sell real goods and services using real coins, it will only\ninclude the basic functions that make eCommerce possible. The Beta phase of\ndevelopment, which will run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version, is aimed at\nbuilding the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce\nexperience and slowly integrating them as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nThis phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for\nthe marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features. For this reason,\nBeta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact\nthat every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of\nthe features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta\nphase:\n\n * Inventory management\n * Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)\n * Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging\n   will likely be integrated in more than one way)\n * Private markets (or “Bubbles)\n * Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)\n * Escrow recovery and refunds\n * A section for wanted items\n * Shipping carrier integration\n * …and more (click here)!\n   [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a]\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n> Note: The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon\nas the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each\nnew Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release\nCandidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features\nare not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\nBranching Off\nAs discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see\nits development be split into two branches: the Development branch, and the\nStable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will\nmake testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds\neasier to share with friends.\n\nThe Development branch will be where all the newly introduced features first get\nadded. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues,\nthis simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super\nstable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but\nis necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly\nby the more advanced types of user.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, a new branch, the Stable branch, will be introduced\nwhere only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to\nhave a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also\nhave all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features\nthat will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed\nthrough the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much\nmore enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing\nwith other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).\n\nIn simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it\nwill first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the\nrougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the\nfeature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of\ntesting. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto\nmainnet and able to be used with real funds.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nIt would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace\non mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project\nand the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by\neveryone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the\neCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data\nand shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to\noffer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless,\nprivate-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can\nparticipate.\n\nWhat’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to\nspend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire\ncryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No\nmore will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to\nbuy stuff with crypto.\n\nThis release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of\nblockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at\nthis time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group\nof projects that have a product live on mainnet!\n\nWhile this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the\nfirst full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably\nfunctioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real\ncrypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the\nproject on all angles.\n\nWe cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you\nand watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

It was the first blockchain to <strong>natively integrate Segwit</strong> and have it enabled for all of its transactions, the first project to integrate <strong>RingCT</strong> on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote), the first project to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\">implement </a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\"><strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\"> on Bitcoin’s codebase</a> and push it onto mainnet, the first project to <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34\">implement </a><a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34\"><strong>cold staking</strong></a> for its entire mainnet network, and the first project to enable a true PoS (not <a href=\"https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/\">dPoS</a> or <a href=\"https://thebitcoinnews.com/what-is-delegated-byzantine-fault-tolerance/\">dBFT</a>) coin to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>safely cold stake from a hardware device</strong></a> (Ledger Nano S). To make all of this a reality, the Particl developers have been producing a lot of high-quality code, earning the team a spot within the top tiers of <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9\">several Github audit reports/reviews</a>.</p><p>All of these achievements are surely impressive, especially coming from a <a href=\"http://coincodecap.com\">team that’s relatively quite small compared to other projects producing similar amount</a> and quality of code (a look at the contributors section of <a href=\"http://coincodecap.com\">this code quality ranking</a> tells everything you need to know). But what this story fails to mention is that none of the accomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the project, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product. In fact, all of them exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the security, privacy, stability, and scalability of the network in prevision for the <strong>mainnet release</strong> of Particl’s first application: the Open Marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"the-open-marketplace\">The Open Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-NK_QEHjFX4l0rjIwuXfaoA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Open Marketplace is a product that’s been in the making for quite some time and has proven to be a huge undertaking due to its extremely ambitious nature.</p><p>In short, it is an <strong>entirely trustless marketplace with full privacy baked in by default and with almost no fee at all</strong>. The fact that it is trustless means that it can function autonomously and without any third-party having to get involved at any point in time. This allows fees to be brought down to the bare minimum and completely eliminates the trust factor involved when making online sales and purchases.</p><p>Its privacy aspect, which probably is the most groundbreaking aspect of the Open Marketplace, makes it so that all purchases and sales you make are verifiably private/anonymous. Whatever you do within the platform generates no identifiable data at all, meaning that it can’t be harvested by Particl or any other third-party other than the one you are transacting with. In other words, nothing you do on Particl’s Open Marketplace can leave any trace behind.</p><p>This privacy aspect truly is a <strong>revolution within the eCommerce industry</strong>, an industry that has made its fortune preying on its own users by collecting their data, without their consent, in order to get profits and influence.</p><p>The simple fact that no other project has ever attempted to build a completely trustless marketplace with rock solid privacy built directly at its core speaks about the complexity of the task. Being the first at doing something also means very few examples and proofs-of-concept are out there to help pave the way forward, but it also means that you can create a niche audience around your “new way” and capitalize on it!</p><p>Even though a lot of development progress has been made to the Open Marketplace in 2018, the fact it has only been operable on testnet for the entire year has made people more eager than ever to see some kind of mainnet release and finally get their hands on a working version of this groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"mainnet-is-finally-upon-us-\">Mainnet is Finally Upon Us!</h2><p>The days where the Open Marketplace is only available as a testnet product are coming to an end. We’ve stated in the past we wanted this year to be different in nature from the previous one, and so let’s start it with a bang! Whereas 2018 was solely focused on development, 2019 will see much more action with the release of the Open Marketplace on mainnet. The best part? <strong>The mainnet release of the Alpha version of Particl’s Open Marketplace is now imminent!</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"the-timeline\">The Timeline</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-CG1uULpg0YcDHmdA3af8dQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As stated in an <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-1-fe6a3f3014c2#3a6d\"><strong>answer</strong></a> to a question asked during our latest AMA/FAQ session, one of the decisions the Particl team has taken in South Africa has been to focus on making the current Alpha version of the marketplace completely stable and move it onto mainnet as soon as that stability is reached. In other words, in just a short time, it will finally be possible to <strong>buy and sell real goods and services </strong>on Particl’s Open Marketplace and do it with <strong>real coins</strong>!</p><h3 id=\"alpha-development-phase-ends-and-releases-on-mainnet\">Alpha Development Phase Ends and Releases on Mainnet</h3><p>The current Alpha version contains all the necessary tools for basic eCommerce to be possible, including weighted decentralized governance to keep it clean (which is currently available internally, but is not merged on public testnet just yet). Once Alpha is successfully moved onto mainnet, it will mark the end of the Alpha period for the Open Marketplace and the beginning of the Beta phase.</p><h3 id=\"alpha-mainnet-features\">Alpha Mainnet Features</h3><p>If you’ve played with recent versions of the marketplace on testnet, then you will find yourself within a familiar environment when running it on mainnet. All of the features introduced throughout the year on testnet will now be available, and very stable, within a real-life environment. There is no better way to test features, especially those relying on game-theory such as the MAD escrow and the decentralized governance mechanism, than to put them into the wild where real funds and incentives are involved.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that, as the current switch from testnet to mainnet <strong>won’t require any sort of hardfork</strong>, the first mainnet version of the Open Marketplace<strong> won’t process transactions using Particl’s RingCT protocol</strong> which will stay on testnet for the time being. What this means is that <strong>marketplace transactions will be pseudonymous, not anonymous</strong>, until RingCT is fully implemented into the escrow system at some point in time during Beta’s development phase.</p><p>The mainnet version of the Open Marketplace Alpha will contain these features:</p><ul><li>Buy and sell real products and services with real coins</li><li>Trustless and fee-less escrow mechanism <strong>without RingCT privacy</strong></li><li>Decentralized governance mechanism to flag listings</li><li>Community proposals</li></ul><h3 id=\"beta-development-phase-begins-soon-testnet-\">Beta Development Phase Begins Soon (Testnet)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-wjnOCuj7RO9udfXb_PWj4A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>While the Alpha mainnet version of the marketplace will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell real goods and services using real coins, it will only include the basic functions that make eCommerce possible. The Beta phase of development, which will <strong>run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version</strong>, is aimed at building the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce experience and slowly integrating them as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate\"><strong>Release Candidates</strong></a>. This phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!</p><p><strong>Whereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for the marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features.</strong> For this reason, Beta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact that every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of the features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta phase:</p><ul><li>Inventory management</li><li>Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)</li><li>Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging will likely be integrated in more than one way)</li><li>Private markets (or “Bubbles)</li><li>Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)</li><li>Escrow recovery and refunds</li><li>A section for wanted items</li><li>Shipping carrier integration</li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a\"><strong>…and more (click here)!</strong></a></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon as the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each new Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"branching-off\">Branching Off</h3><p>As discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see its development be <strong>split into two branches</strong>: the Development branch, and the Stable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will make testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds easier to share with friends.</p><p>The <strong>Development branch</strong> will be where all the newly introduced features first get added. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues, this simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super stable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but is necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly by the more advanced types of user.</p><p>For the sake of convenience, a new branch, the <strong>Stable branch</strong>, will be introduced where only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to have a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also have all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features that will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed through the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much more enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing with other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).</p><p>In simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it will first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the feature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of testing.

No new features is currently\nbeing implemented until the Alpha build is made entirely stable. Having a super\nstable build will make integrating new features on it much faster and easier and\nshould lead to more regular (and exciting) releases.\n\nThe Alpha Version Moves Up to Mainnet\nOnce the testnet Alpha version of the marketplace is fully stable and thoroughly\ntested, it will be moved up onto Particl’s mainnet, allowing you to purchase and\nsell real items using real PART coins. This milestone event will mark the end of\nthe Alpha phase of development and initiate the Beta phase.\n\nLimited Features\nThis first ever mainnet version of Particl’s Open Marketplace won’t require any\nsort of hardfork and will only contain a limited set of features. The features\navailable will be the same features that have been on testnet for some time.\nThis includes decentralized governance with coin weight, as well as the complete\nbuy and sell flow. Community proposals, although not directly a marketplace\nfeature, will also be live on mainnet.\n\nNo Privacy Enhancing Features in This Version\nIt’s very important to note that this mainnet version won’t be coupled with the\nRingCT hardfork yet, meaning that the MAD escrow system won’t be enhanced with\nit. This means that all marketplace transactions made on this version of the\nmarketplace will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is hardforked onto\nmainnet and integrated into the escrow system during Beta. You can rest assured,\nhowever, that no other data will be generated by the marketplace.\n\nThe Beta Phase Will be Focused on Adding New Features\nNew features will be introduced during the Beta phase and will be integrated\ninto existing testing builds as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nRelease Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of\nfeatures are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused on building the base layer for the marketplace, Beta\nwill be focused on integrating new features. A fully stable marketplace codebase\nwill result in quicker releases with something new to show for almost everytime,\nand it should also be a much more exciting phase for everyone than Alpha.\n\nBeta Starts as Soon as Alpha Ends\nThe Beta phase of development will start immediately after the Alpha phase is\ncompleted and moved onto mainnet. The next build that will follow the first\nmainnet version of the Open Marketplace will be a Beta build and will be\nreleased, like Alpha was up until the end, on testnet.\n\nTwo Development Branches Used During Beta\nDuring Beta, two types of branches, Development and Stable, will be used to push\ntestnet builds to the community.\n\nDevelopment Branch\n\nThe Development branch will be the first place where new features will be\navailable for community testing. Because introducing new features almost\ninevitably introduces bugs and issues, this may mean the Development branch\nmight not be super stable all the time. This is not ideal to get a good number\nof testers (if it’s broken all the time, people are less interested in testing\nthe builds) and to show friends. After all, what’s worse than showing a friend a\nbuild of Particl’s Open Marketplace only for it to crash in your face).\n\nStable Branch\n\nThis is where the Stable branch comes in. This branch will be used to push\nfeatures that have already went through a good number of tests and that have\nbeen fixed of most bugs and issues. While the Stable branch is still a testnet\nbranch, it will make builds much more stable and easy to share with friends.\nThis branch is the final step before a feature is introduced onto mainnet.\n\nA Feature’s Path to Mainnet\nWith this new strategy, a feature now has to go through one additional hoop\nbefore being implemented on mainnet. It first needs to be tested internally by\nthe team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of\nmost of its bugs and issues, the feature gets implemented onto the Stable branch\nfor its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be\nintegrated onto mainnet.\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nThis mainnet release marks an important milestone for Particl. It separates it\nfrom the group forming the majority of blockchain projects that do not have any\nsort of product ready at this time and gives it an entry ticket into a much more\nlimited category of projects that have a product live on mainnet. What’s more,\nit will signify the beginning of a brand new phase for the project and the\ncommunity as it will now be easier than ever to spend cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

Because introducing new features almost inevitably introduces bugs and issues, this may mean the Development branch might not be super stable all the time. This is not ideal to get a good number of testers (if it’s broken all the time, people are less interested in testing the builds) and to show friends. After all, what’s worse than showing a friend a build of Particl’s Open Marketplace only for it to crash in your face).</p><p><strong>Stable Branch</strong></p><p>This is where the Stable branch comes in. This branch will be used to push features that have already went through a good number of tests and that have been fixed of most bugs and issues. While the Stable branch is still a testnet branch, it will make builds much more stable and easy to share with friends. This branch is the<strong> final step before a feature is introduced onto mainnet.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-feature-s-path-to-mainnet\">A Feature’s Path to Mainnet</h3><p>With this new strategy, a feature now has to go through one additional hoop before being implemented on mainnet. It first needs to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the feature gets implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto mainnet.</p><h3 id=\"biggest-milestone-to-date\">Biggest Milestone to Date</h3><p>This mainnet release marks an important milestone for Particl. It separates it from the group forming the majority of blockchain projects that do not have any sort of product ready at this time and gives it an entry ticket into a much more limited category of projects that have a product live on mainnet. What’s more, it will signify the beginning of a brand new phase for the project and the community as it will now be easier than ever to spend cryptocurrencies.</p><hr><p>Want to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious eCommerce in general?
