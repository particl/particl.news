In fact, the Particl\nproject has grown into an impressive network full of technological innovations.\nWhile some of the innovations are currently available on mainnet (Particl\nDesktop, cold staking, Ledger staking, Confidential Transactions, atomic swaps,\nand etc), most of the really impressive stuff (decentralized marketplace,\ntrustless MAD escrow system, decentralized project governance, decentralized\nmarketplace governance, staking pool, etc) either currently only resides on\nParticl’s public testnet or in developers’ personal repositories and still under\nheavy development.\n\nSome crypto rating agencies have taken notice of the prowesses our development\nteam has pulled off. For example, Particl consistently ranked in the top 7 (\ncurrently ranked 6th\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) of Darpal [https://medium.com/@DPRating]’s monthly reports in 2018, a Github\ncode rating agency, for the entire year of 2018. Particl is consistently ranked\nfirst among privacy coins as well as decentralized marketplaces! CryptoMiso\n[https://cryptomiso.com/], another Github monitoring rating group, currently\nranks Particl in 15th place out of a total of 867 ranked projects within the\nlast 12 months.\n\nWhat if there was a way to visualize Particl’s development history in a more\nuser-friendly way than to manually scan Github stats?\nWith the help of the open-source Github visualizer software Gource\n[http://gource.io/], we produced a series of videos demonstrating the constant\nand impressive work our development team has put into Particl since its\ninception (and the weeks leading up to it).\n\nIn the following videos, you will see visualizations of Particl’s Github\nactivity throughout time. Each moving user you see is a developer that has had\nactivity recorded on one of the displayed repositories. Remember, as we\nconstantly keep our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s, this time-lapse video is\na testament to the cooperation of our 2 teams display. Rather than being in\ncompetition with Bitcoin, Particl is a privacy-focused compliment to Bitcoin,\nand you can see that immediately with both teams represented and developing\nin-step with one another.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Overview of the Particl Network\nLinks: Particl-Core [http://particl-core], Particl-Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop] (market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/market] branch), Particl-Market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market], Partyman (cold staking)\n[https://github.com/dasource/partyman], Copay [https://github.com/particl/copay]\n, OMP-Lib [https://github.com/particl/omp-lib], Atomicswap\n[https://github.com/particl/atomicswap], Particl-Bitcore-Lib\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-lib], Bitcore-Mnemonic, \nParticl-Bitcoind-RPC [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcoind-rpc], \nParticl-Bitcore-Message [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-message], \nParticl-Bitcore-Node [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-node], \nBlue-App-BTC [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc], Particl-Insight-API\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-api], Particl-Insight-UI\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-ui], Partsuite_Partd\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partd], Partsuite_Partutil\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partutil]\n\nWhat Am I Seeing in This Video?\nTecnovert, Particl’s Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer, making some commits\nThis Particl network overview video regroups all of the major development-based\nrepositories, meaning that non-development repositories such as the particl.io\n[https://github.com/particl/particl.io], branding\n[https://github.com/particl/branding], whitepaper\n[https://github.com/particl/whitepaper], as well as a few others are excluded.\nIt shows Particl developers’ Github activity over time. Each moving user is a\nGithub user that has contributed to one of the listed repositories, and each\n“ray” being shot from these users is a contribution. Furthermore, we have\nhighlighted Particl developers so that their names and pictograms appear in\ngreen whereas Bitcoin Core developers appear as a white/grey name color.\n\nEach “node” represents a folder within one of our repositories and their link to\nother folders are identified by “branches”. Every folder within the same\nrepository is represented under the same “master branch”.\n\nNote: None of these visualizations displays all the work done by the development\nteam. Indeed, each repository is represented by a single Git branch, meaning\nthat work accomplished on other git branches is not reflected in the animation.\nFor example, Particl Desktop’s visualization is set up on the “market” branch,\nwhich is the most up-to-date but doesn’t display the work being done on the \nfeature-multiwallet-v2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/feature/multiwallet-v2] and \nproposals [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/proposals] branches\n(see active branches here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/branches]\n).\n\nObservations\nWhat is particularly interesting to notice is just how much the Bitcoin Core\ndevelopers are contributing, indirectly, to the Particl project. In fact,\nbecause we constantly update our codebase to match the latest version of Bitcoin\nCore, we benefit from all the ongoing research and development going on over the\nBitcoin network.\n\nMoreover, keeping our codebase up-to-date not only grants the Particl blockchain\nwith all the security, performance, stability, privacy, and utility enhancements\nmade to the Bitcoin blockchain, but it also enables our development team to fork\nany interesting Bitcoin product and adapt it to work over the Particl network.\n\nParticl Copay, our mobile wallet currently available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay&hl=en] and for \ndesktops [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases], is a great example and\ndemonstration of this concept. In fact, Copay [https://github.com/bitpay/copay] \nhas initially been developed by Bitpay [https://github.com/bitpay] and was\ndesigned to be a Bitcoin-only mobile wallet. It was, however, forked by the\nParticl development team to give its community an easy-to-use mobile wallet that\ncould also double as a tool to generate and use Particl multi-signature\naddresses, a feature that, to this day, is still only available on Particl\nCopay.\n\nParticl Desktop & Particl Market From Up Close\nWe’ve also isolated three of the repositories shown in the Particl Network\nvisualization and zoomed in to show in greater details the work being\naccomplished. These three repositories are the three main ones in the project\nand are the ones which are being developed the most to accomplish our vision.\n\nParticl Desktop\nParticl Market\nParticl Core in Comparison to Bitcoin Core\nIn the video above, you can compare both Bitcoin’s (left) and Particl’s (right)\ncore codebases. This visualization really highlights the relentless work\naccomplished by our Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer Tecnovert as he adds\nfeatures on top of the Bitcoin codebase at a record speed while constantly\nkeeping Particl’s codebase version in sync with that of Bitcoin’s.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Development-Timeline-Video/1-QqvirCy91HiCO2ToI4Il9Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The Particl project has now been around for around 14 months.

Simply put, this\nmechanism allows anyone to be able to vote or submit up for a vote a formal\nproposal to the Particl community.\n\nNote: The initial version of the governance system will not contain all the\nfeatures and functionalities that are planned for later versions (i.e. voting\nweight). It will, however, be its first “working version” and will contain most\n(or all) of the basic functionalities. The governance mechanisms will, of\ncourse, be a moving target for some time as we experiment with it in real-life\nscenarios.\n\nHow Does it Work?\nCommunity Proposal ScreenAs many of you already know, Particl has had a fully\ndecentralized voting system on our mainnet ever since it launched in July 2017.\nThis feature, however, has always only been available on CLI (non-graphical\nParticl wallet) and is relatively restrictive in nature. For example, using the\n“legacy” voting system of Particl, it was not possible to vote on two proposals\nat the same time. This behavior not being the most scalable for a truly useful\ndecentralized governance system, the team has been actively working on improving\nthis voting mechanism to give it more flexibility and accessibility.\n\nThe first improvement was to implement it into Particl Desktop, the main wallet\nfor the Particl network. Because Particl-cli isn’t really used by most people\noutside of staking — and more importantly, because users are more likely to use\na simple, well-designed interface to provide them a voice on the network — it\nwas really important to port this feature over our main client.\n\nDecentralized Voting ScreenOnce implemented, it will be possible to go through\nthe entire proposal process directly from Particl Desktop. Indeed, users will be\nable to both create a proposal from scratch and submit it to the community for a\nvoting round. Any Particl user will then be able to navigate to their voting\nscreen and vote on any ongoing proposal. To vote, users do not need to be\nstaking anymore, and weight will ultimately be based on coin weight rather than\nstaking weight. This decision has been made in order to increase the governance\ntool’s accessibility and speed at which consensuses can be reached.\n\nIn fact, users that own fewer amounts of coins are less likely to put up their\ncoins for staking, yet they ideally still need to have a way to express their\nvoice so that the governance system can truly be considered democratic and\ndecentralized. There are many other reasons users would not want to put their\ncoins up for staking, yet when the project governance tool releases on mainnet,\nthey will still be able to partake in the project’s decentralized governance\nprocess they have a stake in.\n\nTallying the number of coins instead of the staking weights is also a much more\naccurate and quick measurement. Indeed, Proof-of-Stake relies partly on luck,\nsimilarly to PoW mining, which is democratically not ideal for obvious reasons;\naccurate results are more interesting than results partly defined by luck. This\nnew governance system mostly requires users to sign a message proving they own\nthe number of coins that they do and that they are voting from their outputs.\nDon’t worry, this all happens automatically under the hood while the entire\ngovernance process is displayed in a user-friendly fashion on Particl Desktop.\nTallying coins instead of staking weights also allows the mechanism to find\nconsensuses more rapidly in certain situations, a feat that is definitely useful\nas that same mechanism is also the basis for the marketplace governance system\nwhere undesirable content needs to be taken out as quickly as possible.\n\nVotes are tallied every time a user votes, which means that as you move your\ncoins around, so do your votes as well. It is thus possible to easily change\nyour vote if you move your coins before a voting round completes.\n\nCold Voting\nThe project governance mechanism is also built with hardware compatibility in\nmind. In fact, as stated in yesterday’s announcement of the integration of\nParticl on the Ledger Nano S\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae],\nusers will eventually be able to “cold vote” using their Ledger Nano S hardware\ndevice directly from the Particl Desktop client. This is probably not a feature\nthat will be available out of the box once the project governance system hits\nmainnet as it still requires a bit of work on our end, but it will ultimately be\navailable at some point in the future. This is directly related to our\ncommitment to develop and make available the most secure blockchain solutions in\nthe industry. To understand the significance of cold voting vs regular,\nespecially as it relates to security, read our Hardware Cold Staking\nannouncement here\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\n\nCommunity Initiative Fund\nBack when Particl users were asked to generate their keys and prepare for the\nParticl genesis block, an initiative has been proposed by the community to\ncompensate SDC coin holders who had failed to swap their coins within the given\nswap timeframe. As such, the community donated an impressive amount of over \n156,000 PART\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm] \nto be paid to the late swappers. Since the clemency period was set up to last\nup\nuntil the last day of 2017\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it wasn’t\npossible at the time to know how many late swappers would claim their PART\ncoins, thus making the donation target a blind one. For this reason, Particl\nusers ended up donating an excess amount of coins to the Community Initiative\nFund. This address contains, without any late swapping claims being accepted\nanymore, a final total amount of 33,817.64 PART.\n\nThe Community in Control\nThe Community Initiative Fund is a donation address owned by the Particl\ncommunity itself. In fact, since its funds originate from community donations,\nneither the Particl Foundation nor the Particl team can move them around without\nany form of community consensus first.\n\nTo facilitate debates around proposed solutions, ideas, and proposals made on\nhow to best use these funds, we’ve announced\n[https://particl.news/building-a-framework-for-community-contribution-e056c04c9c09] \nand created back in January a Kialo discussion thread\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e].\nKialo is a good debate platform where users can form arguments and\ncounter-arguments in a structured and easy-to-follow fashion.\n\nAs we are nearing the testnet and mainnet implementations of the project\ngovernance system on Particl Desktop, there has never been a better time to put\ndown on paper and on Kialo any proposal idea you have been thinking about. The\nbest way to get your proposal accepted by the community is to create excitement\nleading up to the voting round, therefore initiating discussions around your\nproject early on could end up helping your proposal being voted in favor of. If\nyou submit any idea on Kialo, make sure to post about it on our Discord server\nor in the coming Particl forum so that people can know and discuss it.\n\nAs the decentralized project governance system still requires a bit of work and\nof course, testing, there is still some time left to prepare your proposals\nuntil we hold official voting rounds related to the Community Initiative Fund.\nMore details about these rounds will be included in a next Decentralized Project\nGovernance Update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon’t forget that you can track most of the development process by following us\non Github [https://github.com/particl].

This new report\ncontains a lot of information about the status of the project’s development as\nwell as a pretty good presentation of the features that are most likely to be\nincluded in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace.\n\nWhat We Are Busy With\nThis section of the report shows what the Particl development team is already\nworking on. These items are currently under active development and are the\nprimary short-term focus points of our developers.\n\nMarketplace\nAs many of you already know, the team is currently heavily focused on developing\nand putting together both the project and marketplace governance systems.\n\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThe project governance system\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] will allow users to\ncreate and submit proposals for the community to vote on. These proposals will\nbe extremely useful to reach consensus within the community in a provably fair\nfashion. This proposal system is required for the community to vote on what to\ndo with the remaining funds in the Community Initiative Fund\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e] \n(~33,000 PART, 100% community-owned).\n\nThe marketplace governance system, on the other hand, is the function that\nallows users to flag undesirable content on Particl Marketplace. As no party\nother than the community itself has moderation powers over the marketplace, this\nfeature is considered an absolute requirement for the marketplace DApp to be\nreleased on mainnet. Indeed, this mechanism gives community moderation powers\nover the content posted on it so that it can stay clean and free of\nreprehensible or spammy content.\n\nAside from both governance systems, there is also quite a few improvements being\nmade to the marketplace based on the various feedback we’ve received from all of\nthe people who have tested the Alpha version. This includes the refactoring of\nseveral aspects of the code, making it much smoother, faster, and intuitive to\nuse, and a few new feature enhancements such as advanced filtering options and\nexpiry time on listed products.\n\nA few items here are actually quite interesting. In fact, the team is currently\nworking on a new hardware wallet integration, Trezor, to give users more options\nwhen it comes to secure storage of funds.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nA major and long-awaited Particl Desktop feature has also started being worked\non [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], namely multi-wallets.\nThis function enables the possibility to set up several different wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is a great feature for both security,\nprivacy, and usability.\n\nTwo Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop InstanceMulti-wallets\nallow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of\nmismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen\nas different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each\nwallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace\nprofiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there\nis no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them,\nthe previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other\nwallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type\nof data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same\nParticl Desktop instance.\n\nThis feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles\nor accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing\nmarketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process.\nUsers can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one\nof them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.\n\nIndeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet,\neven if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each\nstaking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a\ndifferent address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per\nwallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by\nredirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they\nwant (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the\nother 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop\nprojects on the Particl network).\n\nTrezor Integration\nTrezor Hardware WalletWe’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration,\nbut we’re not stopping there. With the goal of providing our users with more\nflexibility by making more options available, we can announce that we have\nstarted working on an integration to the Trezor hardware wallet\n[https://trezor.io/]!\n\n> Trezor is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin\ntransactions. With Trezor, transactions are completely safe even when initiated\non a compromised or vulnerable computer. Because the use of Trezor is very easy\nand intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption among people not familiar\nwith the security issues. —https://wiki.trezor.io/FAQ:Overview\nWaiting for Review\nA few items have been completed and are awaiting the final review before being\nintegrated. Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for\nReview”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade,\nhave been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet\npre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated\nsoon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal\nscreen and notification system for order status changes.\n\nWhat’s on the Horizon — Beta\nThis section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items\nfor the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what\nthe Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the\ndevelopment team will be working in the short to mid-term.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nAs pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are\ngoing to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.\n\nStarting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace\nThis simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode\nonly when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl\nDesktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re\nlaunching it from (~400mb less memory required).\n\nPrivate Markets & Listings\nPrivate markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These\nmarkets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of\nParticl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link\n(usually provided by the market creator).\n\nPrivate listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like\nprivate markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market\nunless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings\nintend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you\nwere to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.\n\nWhile these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they\nare deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed\nwith a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold\nin order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing\nwould be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very\npopular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.\n\nEscrow Enhancements & Deposit Negotiations\nThe decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl\nMarketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the\nvery obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration\nof the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by\nthe NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm.\nOther enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its\nstability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and\nmore.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nAnother needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client\nis a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well\nas various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an\never-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more\noptions as the Particl platform grows.\n\nParticl Software Development Kit\nAnother long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development\ntoolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized\napplications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the\nrelease of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where\noutside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own.

This proposal system is required for the community to vote on <a href=\"https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e\">what to do with the remaining funds in the Community Initiative Fund</a> (~33,000 PART, 100% community-owned).</p><p>The marketplace governance system, on the other hand, is the function that allows users to flag undesirable content on Particl Marketplace.

This function enables the possibility to set up several different wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance. This is a great feature for both security, privacy, and usability.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-Qo-jqiEtrW8sAEbyAJNGCg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Two Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop Instance</figcaption></figure><p>Multi-wallets allow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of mismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen as different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each wallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace profiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there is no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them, the previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other wallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type of data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same Particl Desktop instance.</p><p>This feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles or accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing marketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process. Users can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one of them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.</p><p>Indeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet, even if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each staking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a different address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per wallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by redirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they want (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the other 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop projects on the Particl network).</p><h3 id=\"trezor-integration\">Trezor Integration</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-VhiG1xJJr_vYYsJczTCLyw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Trezor Hardware Wallet</figcaption></figure><p>We’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration, but we’re not stopping there.

Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for Review”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade, have been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet pre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated soon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal screen and notification system for order status changes.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-horizon-beta\">What’s on the Horizon — Beta</h2><p>This section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items for the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what the Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the development team will be working in the short to mid-term.</p><h3 id=\"multi-wallets-1\">Multi-Wallets</h3><p>As pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are going to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.</p><h3 id=\"starting-particl-desktop-without-the-marketplace\">Starting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace</h3><p>This simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode only when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl Desktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re launching it from (~400mb less memory required).</p><h3 id=\"private-markets-listings\">Private Markets &amp; Listings</h3><p>Private markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These markets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of Particl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link (usually provided by the market creator).</p><p>Private listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like private markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market unless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings intend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you were to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.</p><p>While these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they are deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed with a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold in order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing would be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very popular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.</p><h3 id=\"escrow-enhancements-deposit-negotiations\">Escrow Enhancements &amp; Deposit Negotiations</h3><p>The decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl Marketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the very obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration of the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm. Other enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its stability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and more.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>Another needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client is a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well as various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an ever-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more options as the Particl platform grows.</p><h2 id=\"particl-software-development-kit\">Particl Software Development Kit</h2><p>Another long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development toolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized applications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the release of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where outside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own. We fully intend on organizing hack-a-thons and development contests using Particl’s SDK, and firmly believe the release of this toolkit will cement Particl as a solid decentralized application platform.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-funding-decentralized-organizations-on-particl\">Decentralized Funding &amp; Decentralized Organizations on Particl</h3><p>Combining multi-wallets and the Particl SDK will allow people to request fundings from Particl stakers for any kind of development actively benefiting the Particl network.

In other words, there is no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them, the previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other wallet.

That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by redirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they want (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the other 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop projects on the Particl network)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"trezor-integration"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Trezor Integration"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-card-hascaption"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-VhiG1xJJr_vYYsJczTCLyw.png","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tagName":"figcaption","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Trezor Hardware Wallet"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration, but we’re not stopping there.

We’ve identified\nimportant items that are focus features over the next 6 months and beyond but\naren’t tying these to quarters as we did in our Roadmap v1.2\n[https://particl.news/project-update-november-8th-2017-c0437292e1f8].\n\n*New items can be added or taken away at anytime, this is a living document.\n\nIN PROGRESS:\nWith the release\n[https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-0-1-1dad242b075] of Particl Core\n0.16.0.1 the development team debuts a couple features that they have been\nworking on.\n\nSupport for Hardware Signing Devices\nParticl Core 0.16 introduces generic support for Hardware Signing Devices to\nprovide key-signing capabilities.\n\nLedger Integration\nInitial support for the Ledger Hardware Wallet is here!\n\nThis has not yet been extended to blind or anon tranactions and therefore\ncurrently cannot be used exclusively for all functions of the wallet. Support\nwill continue to be extended in future versions.\n\nStealth Addresses V2\nIn order to facilitate deterministic generation of stealth addresses between\nParticl Core and Signing Devices the method used to generate these addresses had\nto be changed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Marketplace (MP)\nThe majority of our team will be focused on the private decentralized\nmarketplace over the next 6 months. We are readying our Alpha release of the\nParticl Marketplace as I write this.\n\nALPHA is the long-awaited decentralized marketplace dApp within Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.io/downloads/]. The Alpha release of the marketplace will be\nbarebones to start as users begin to test and progress through the\nbuying/selling process.\n\nAs more users onboard we’ll continue refining the user experience and the tools\navailable to vendors and shoppers.\n\nListing Governance\nGovernance won’t be in our initial release of the Markeplace but is one of the\nitems in the pipeline this year. The vision of the Particl Project is to be a\nprivacy focused platform for decentralized applications.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is being built to be self-sustaining, self-governing and\ncompletely decentralized. Governance is a huge piece of the puzzle that the team\nwill be focused on developing to protect privacy and protect users.\n\nSoftware Development Kit (SDK)\nA plan to have a SDK for developers is in the pipeline. The SDK will allow the\ncreation of applications within the Marketplace or Desktop.\n\nThis might not come in 2018 from the Particl team (it is a pipeline item in the\nfuture) but could be a community development item someone takes on as a side\nproject to create. The full support of the dev team will be available to anyone\nwanting to contribute and help speed of delivery of valuable items.\n\n> A software development kit is typically a set of software development tools that\nallows the creation of applications for a certain software package, software\nframework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating\nsystem, or similar development platform. — Wikipedia\nZMQ for MP Messages\nShort for ZeroMQ [http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#-MQ-in-a-Hundred-Words],\nthis is an automated messaging system that allows messages and notifications to\nbe automatically pushed to Particl Desktop. An example would be if Particl\nDesktop has an update available, ZMQ will push notification to Particl Desktop\nand users will see a notice a new version of the Desktop is available.\n\nBETA Marketplace\nOur next major release of the decentralized marketplace will be BETA.\n\nBeta MP may or may-not be a mainnet viable product. It is too early to tell but\nis something the team will be transparent in communicating.\n\nFactors such as Governance and privacy (RingCT) are big factors on whether a\nmainnet marketplace is available in the next 6 months on mainnet. 50/50 is the\nbest bet at the moment; being completely honest and forthcoming.\n\nA Beta marketplace release with governance but without RingCT could happen with\nour Confidential TX’s (CT) already providing privacy on mainnet. CT do a good\njob of hiding amounts (MAD escrow) but don’t provide complete privacy for\naddresses of vendors and buyers in a escrow contract.\n\nPrivacy and Governance are 2 of the major factors that ultimately will determine\nthe BETA marketplace release in the coming 6 months.\n\nFull Particl Marketplace Release\nAll versions of the MP leading up to full release will be testing versions and\nlive versions with new features introduced at each release. Once RingCT is on\nmainnet, Governance is fully developed, and currency-agnostic options like\ncross-chain atomic swaps/integrations have been through the proper testing\nenvironment we’ll plan a Full Particl Marketplace Release.\n\nThis will be the truly private decentralized marketplace that will disrupt the\nway you buy and sell online.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRing Confidential Transactions (RingCT)\nSpeaking of privacy and RingCT, we will see some exciting movement on this\nprivacy enhancement in the next 6 months.\n\nAcademic Review\nIf you aren’t aware, NJIT research Qiang Tang [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/] is\nleading a group in a review of our RingCT privacy on Particl Testnet. Particl\nFoundation created a grant with the university in Sept. 2017 for this research,\nQiang’s lab received the grant money in Nov. 2017\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#activities] and began working on a 6 month review\nin Dec. 2017.\n\nThey are 3 months into review and will provide the foundation with a report\nafter 6 months on the privacy, cryptography and security recommendations for\nParticl’s RingCT implementation on the latest Bitcoin codebase.\n\nBulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions\nA very exciting paper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] was released in\nthe middle of our grant with Qiang (NJIT) that significantly reduces the burden\nof confidential transactions on the blockchain.\n\n> Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing\nproposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nParticl is the only Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency with Confidential Transactions\nlive and available today. We don’t allow CT to be default because of the\nsize/cost this privacy introduces to transactions. Here is an infographic you\nmay have seen showing the size/cost of each level of privacy for PART.\n\nYou can see that transaction size of CT and RingCT are 20x that of the\npseudo-anonymous “public” state most users default to.\n\nBulletproofs is a big development that we will be reviewing this year. We\nestimate research, development, implementation and testing will be a 3–4 month\npart-time assignment for Tecnovert, Particl Lead Core Developer.\n\nRingCT — Mainnet\nIt is fair to give a realistic checklist of the steps needed to see RingCT on\nParticl Mainnet in the coming months. Some work has begun, some work will need\nto be adjusted and some work has yet to begin.\n\n*Future dates are estimates and subject to change.\n\n * June 2017\n   [https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d]— Particl\n   is the first Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency with CT and RingCT on pre-launch\n   testnets\n * July 2017\n   [https://particl.news/particl-launch-update-july-17th-2017-15ec6d4fd6a8]\n   — Particl launches as first project with privacy available through\n   Confidential Transactions on mainnet.

We plan to\nintegrate Particl Cold Staking into this multi-signature wallet.\n\nCommunity Fund Vote\nThere is PART remaining from the Community Initiative Fund #1\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a]— roughly\n30,000 PART (at this time) with a few more claims still being vetted. The\ncommunity needs to create a plan for these extra coins that were donated but not\nneeded. Start brainstorming!\n\nLightning Network\nA lot of excitement is stirring in the space because of lightning (LND)\nreleasing on mainnet. Obviously, this is a big item on our radar as we build\npaths for other cryptocurrency coins to be used on Particl Marketplace.\n\n#BlindLightning | #BlackLightning\nWhat if Particl Confidential TXs or even RingCT could be leveraged in atomic\nswaps/ lightning network transactions between PART and other coins — providing\ntrue privacy for non-private coins?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop — future versions\nIn our last AMAFAQ livestream we also mentioned the current status of our\nflagship app, Particl Desktop.\n\nNew features related to the Particl Marketplace integration into Desktop will be\nongoing throughout 2018. We’ve had a lot of requests for extra widgets and\nfeatures from the community/team that are moving down the pipeline.\n\nBelow we’ve begun a checklist of requested features.\n\n * Multiwallet modal\n * Coin Control\n * Alias Addresses\n * Balances and Staking graphs\n * Remote Daemon Connection\n * Tor Integration\n * Settings modal\n * Modal Refactoring\n\nParticl Marketplace is the main focus of the team moving forward, but you can\nexpect to see some of these features coming into Desktop as well.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Particl-Qt (on Mac) or\nparticld/ particl-qt (on Linux).\n\nCompatibility\nParticl Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux\nkernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\n\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.0.1]\nparticl-core - Particl Core integration/staging tree\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.0.1]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.0.1]\n\n*Particl Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\n\nNotable changes — Wallet\nSupport for Hardware Signing Devices\nParticl Core 0.16 introduces generic support for Hardware Signing Devices to\nprovide key-signing capabilities.\n\n * New RPC commands\n   * listdevices\n   * getdeviceinfo\n   * initaccountfromdevice\n   * getdevicepublickey\n   * getdevicexpub\n   * devicegetnewstealthaddress\n   * devicesignmessage`\n   * devicesignrawtransaction\n\nLedger Hardware Support\nInitial support for the Ledger Hardware Wallet has been included.\nThis has not yet been extended to blind or anon tranactions and therefore\ncurrently cannot be used exclusively for all functions of the wallet. Support\nwill continue to be extended in future versions.\n\n*Note, this is still considered “expert” mode for those who have a good\nunderstanding of how the Protocol works under the hood and are comfortable\ncompiling and flashing developer tools on a Ledger device.\n\nStealth Address v2\nIn order to facilitate deterministic generation of stealth addresses between\nParticl Core and Signing Devices the method used to generate these addresses has\nbeen changed.\n\n * New RPC command devicegetnewstealthaddress will generate a v2 Stealth Address\n   from the Hardware Signing Device.\n * Updated RPC command getnewstealthaddress now supports a new boolean makeV2\n   (default false) which will generate a v2 Stealth Address from the same method\n   used for hardware wallets. This will be updated in a future release to\n   default to true for all new addresses generated.\n\n*Note, Legacy Stealth Addresses are not supported on Hardware Signing Devices.\nIf you have PART/tPART received on the Legacy Stealth Addresses then we suggest\nyou send those PART/tPART to a non-Stealth Address before attempting to use with\nthe Hardware Signing Devices.\n\n> PART = coins on mainnet | tPART* = coins on testnet*tPART have (0)zero value\n\nReplace-By-Fee by default in GUI\nThe send screen now uses BIP125 RBF by default, regardless of -walletrbf. There\nis a checkbox to mark the transaction as final.\n\nThe RPC default remains unchanged: to use RBF, launch with -walletrbf=1 or use\nthe replaceable argument for individual transactions.\n\nWallets directory configuration (-walletdir)\nParticl Core now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be\nlocated.

RingCT is\nalso available on Particl Testnet 6\n\nRead More: https://particl.wiki/what-is#multi-state_privacy\n\nMulti-State Privacy Balance Transfers\nSimilar to “Send Payment”, when using “Balance Transfer” users can send PART\nbetween Public and Blind addresses only they own. Particl Desktop has an easy to\nunderstand interface to lessen the learning curve on balance transfers.\n\nSort and Filter by Type\nWithin the History window Particl Desktop now has some handy filters to easily\nfind past transactions in your app.*\n\nSort transactions by:\n\n * Time\n * Amount\n * Address\n * Category\n * Confirmation\n * Transaction ID (txid)\n\nFilter by Type:\n\n * All types\n * Standard\n * Anonymous\n * Blind\n\n*Includes a “Clear all filters” button\n\nZAP\nThe addition of the ZAP functionality will greatly assist in successful cold\nstaking activation*.

Functions\nI thought this week I’d show off some of the backend work that is completed for\nthe Particl Marketplace. Some of this might be high-level stuff — I admit I felt\na bunch of it fly right over my head even as I was writing about it :)\n\nNevertheless, here is some of the stellar work the Particl Development Team has\nbeen doing on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nPrecursor: Open Market Protocol (OMP)\nI’ve mentioned the OMP before and the author, Ido Kaiser\n[https://liberate.hcpp.cz/#speaker_ido-kaiser], gave a presentation about how to\nbegin building a decentralized marketplace focused on privacy at this year’s\nHackers Congress Paralelní Polis\n\nHackers Congress Paralelní Polis 2017 [https://liberate.hcpp.cz/#speakers]\nHackers Congress Paralelní Polis is one of the premier events for hackers,\nartists, activists, libertarians, and… [https://liberate.hcpp.cz/#speakers]\nliberate.hcpp.cz [https://liberate.hcpp.cz/#speakers]\n\nThe intent of this specification is to create a standardized and open format\nthat can encompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace. It is\na good reference for the functions the team is building into Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nMarket Protocol · GitBook [https://www.gitbook.com/book/kewde/protocol/details]\nprotocol: [https://www.gitbook.com/book/kewde/protocol/details]www.gitbook.com\n[https://www.gitbook.com/book/kewde/protocol/details]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Market Model\nThe diagram above gives an overview of the market model. While not complete, it\nis a good foundation with which the team is building functionality into.\n\nWhat you are visualizing is basically the creation, discovery, agreement and\nfulfillment vendors and buyers make on the marketplace — as well as the\nprogression of ownership of digital and physical goods (cryptocurrency &\nproducts) during and after the contract.\n\nBid Status(s)\nThe basic item listing only contains rudimentary elements, if these are not\navailable then the listing is rejected.\n\n * NEW\n\n{  \n  \"version\":\"0.0.1.0\",\n  \"mpaction\": {\n    \"action\": \"MPA_BID\", \n    \"item\": \"f08f3d6e\",\n    \"objects\":[\n      {\n        \"id\": \"colour\",\n        \"value\": \"black\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n> biddata can contain some values related to the item that its a bid for. size,\ncolour, etc.\n * ACCEPTED\n\n{\n  \"version\":\"0.0.1.0\",\n  \"mpaction\": {\n    \"action\": \"MPA_ACCEPT\", \n    \"item\": \"f08f3d6e\"\n  }\n}\n\n * REJECTED\n\n{\n  \"version\":\"0.0.1.0\",\n  \"mpaction\": {\n    \"action\": \"MPA_REJECT\", \n    \"item\": \"f08f3d6e\"\n  }\n}\n\n * CANCELLED\n\n{\n  \"version\":\"0.0.1.0\",\n  \"mpaction\": {\n    \"action\": \"MPA_CANCEL\", \n    \"item\": \"f08f3d6e\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFunctions (RPC API)\nIf the market model above is a map, these functions are waypoints along the\njourney.\n\nfinditems\nRoute from RpcController to RpcListingItemService.search\n\n- data.params[]:\n[0]: page, number\n\n[1]: pageLimit, number\n\n[2]: order, SearchOrder\n\n[3]: category, number|string, if string, try to find using key, can be null\n\n[4]: searchString, string, can be null\n\ncall ListingItemService.search with ListingItemSearchParams, validate params\n\nsupport for paging\n\nsupport for sorting and filtering by different fields, which are:\n\n- categories\n\nreturn Collection of ListingItem\n\ngetitem\nRoute to rpcListingItemService.findOne\n\n- data.params[]:\n[0]: id or hash\n\nfindOne is implemented (ListingItemService/Repository), but it uses the item id, need to add findOneByHash\n\n- returns ListingItem with relations\n\nfindownitems\n“ownitem” is a ListingItem which is related to a ListingItemTemplate which is\nrelated to profile.

This is the only key to your wallet. Lose the key,\nlose the wallet!\n\n? Congratulations! You’ve created your Staking Node wallet. Let’s continue.\n\nCreate a Cold Staking Public Key\nNext, we’ll create the public key which we will use within the Particl Core GUI\n(Particl Wallet) to activate Cold Staking. We can use the Partyman App for this\ntoo.\n\nCreate new staking node public key\n./partyman stakingnode new\n\nFollow the directions to complete staking node public key creation. You should\nsee a Particl public key similar to this:\n\n? Congratulations! You’ve created your Cold Staking Public Key.\n\nSummary: Staking Node Setup\nYou’ve successfully setup your first computer:\n\n * Latest Particl Core daemon\n * Created a wallet\n * Created a staking node public key.\n\nYour Staking Node setup for this computer is done. Next we’ll move onto the 2nd\ncomputer and complete setting up Particl Cold Staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Wallet App: An advanced graphical user interface (GUI)\n * The Particl Wallet App works in tandem with Particl Core (daemon).\n * You don’t need to open both applications.\n * Particl Wallet will automatically download, install and run the latest daemon\n   from the Particl Core releases during startup.\n\nOn your 2nd computer: Launch the Particl Wallet App\n\n> If this is your first time using Particl Wallet you’ll be met with a “New\nWallet” screen that recommends you encrypt the wallet before anything and then\ngives you the option to create a new wallet or import an existing wallet. Walk\nthrough the steps if you haven’t already.\nhttps://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*yD1WrAoB69uibKtAFYrYDw.gif\n\nUnlock wallet for staking\nIn the upper right hand of the GUI there are three icons.\n\n * Clicking on the middle “lock” icon brings up a dialog window.\n * Check the “Unlock for Staking only” box\n * Enter your encryption phrase\n * Click “Unlock wallet” button\n\nAdd Cold Staking Node Key\nWithin the Cold Staking modal on the right side of the wallet:\n\n * Click the “+” button for Cold Staking Node\n\nA dialog box saying “Cold Wallet Setup” pops up.\n\n * Enter your Cold Staking Public Key you created earlier on your staking node.\n * Click “Enable cold staking” button\n\nA dialog box saying “Unlock your wallet” pops up.\n\n\n? Congratulations! You’ve initiated the Cold Staking Activation Process\n\nThe Cold Staking box on your dashboard should now show a Cold Staking Progress\nbar. It is very important to follow the instructions in the box that says, \n“Please keep this wallet online until the cold staking activation process is\ncomplete.”\n\nKeep in mind, it may take several weeks to finish the activation process. With\neach stake the percentage increases towards 100%.\n\nSummary\nThis guide is now complete. Here is a list of accomplishments you have achieved\nby reaching the end.\n\n * Created a Staking Node wallet\n * Created a Staking Node Public Key\n * Linked a Staking Node wallet with 0 PART to a 2nd wallet on another computer\n   that has the PART you want to stake.\n * Unlocked wallet with PART tokens for staking only\n * Enabled the Cold Staking Activation Process\n\nOnce you’ve reached 100% complete on the Cold Staking progress bar your two\nwallets are linked. The staking node wallet needs to be online 24/7 to receive\nstaking rewards. The wallet holding your PART tokens can be offline, safe and\nsecure.\n\nFor more information on Particl Cold Staking we created a primer here:\n\nPrimer: Cold Staking on Particl\n[https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac]\nQuantum Computer Resistantparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Who said creating smart contracts had to be complicated?","html":"<h3 id=\"a-node-a-wallet-and-a-smart-contract\">A Node, a Wallet and a Smart Contract</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Guide--Setting-up-Particl-Cold-Staking/0-0Rji14Eh7rHqdiuY.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"components-of-cold-staking\">Components of Cold Staking</h2><ul><li>A <strong>Staking Node</strong> — running a new wallet</li><li>A <strong>Wallet</strong> with your PART tokens</li><li>A <strong>Cold Staking Script </strong>— this is like the script in bitcoin or smart contracts on other alts</li></ul><p>The <strong>Staking Node</strong> is a computer running Particl that is always on and always connected to the internet.

Particl Foundation has been using Particl Copay to manage its affairs\nfor both BTC and PART since inception in July. Available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay] and our Particl\nGithub repository [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases].\n\nQ3 2017 | Particl Electron Wallet App—News Update\n[https://particl.news/built-on-electron-we-proudly-introduce-particl-wallet-v0-1-0-4f312c3df41f]\n\nThe first official builds for this product were for testnet only. However,\neveryone has been free to compile this wallet for mainnet since its release in\nSeptember. The Particl team will be releasing their first official builds of our\nGUI release for mainnet this week. The past 5 weeks have been all hands on deck\nto ensure we have a beautiful, smooth wallet ready for Cold Staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClosing Out\nQ4 2017 | Cold Staking—News Update\n[https://particl.news/alert-particl-hardfork-nov-10th-4ca5b994017c]\n\nThis Friday, Cold Staking will be activated on mainnet meaning it has graduated\nfrom the testing environment (testnet) into the arms of every user working on\nthe network!\n\nDon’t be left behind! You may be one of the nodes still running old protocol.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Additions\nQ4 2017 | Atomic Swaps\n\nThis quarter the PART blockchain will realize it’s not alone in this world! The\ngreat guys at Decred Project tested and approved the PR a couple weeks ago. Keep\na lookout for promotion of DCR/PART atomic swaps. We will continue to test and\ncollaborate cross chain transactions with other projects.

Above, we shared the new team\nmembers that are coming on to help us reach these goals.\n\nThis week also closes the last critical path item (cold staking) for public\nrelease so the team can focus 100% on the Privacy Marketplace. Case in point, a\nnew huge initial commit on paid SMSG code posted earlier today!\n\nInitial paid smsg code. · particl/particl-core@4596cf3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\nNew -smsgsaddnewkeys option restores the old behaviour of searching for\nmessages\non all new keys Moved stake and…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\ngithub.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore 3rd-Party Integrations\nBeginning next week the Dev Team will be back full strength on the Marketplace\napplication. We are always in conversations with people with projects that will\nadd value to Particl. A big piece of the framework that makes up the Particl\nPlatform is having spending/trading/commerce flexibility between\ncryptocurrencies and off platform.\n\nWe’ve shared on Twitter our GUI integrations of some of the popular exchanges\nwe’ve built relationships with — Changelly and Shapeshift among others. These\nintegrations don’t require full-team input, typically just our Lead Core\nDeveloper Tecnovert’s expertise.\n\n> \nAs the opportunity presents itself we will push for valuable integrations that\nwill benefit the Particl Framework and our users. One to keep a lookout for is\nwith the team at Ledger.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch Grant\nOne of our token exchange milestones was to create a research grant with a major\nuniversity.\n\nGiven the resources and focus an education institution can bring to a privacy\nproject like Particl, we saw this as a way to leverage research students and\nfaculty towards decentralized marketplace economics.\n\nThe Foundation began November with a $35,000 donation to the New Jersey\nInstitute of Technology that gives us a focused team of students\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#student] and faculty lead by Assistant Professor \nQiang Tang [http://cs.njit.edu/people/qiang-tang].\n\nHis team will spend 6 months combing over privacy enhancements Particl has added\non top of Bitcoin such as Ring Signature Confidential Transactions (RingCT) and\nfocused research surrounding decentralized marketplaces, privacy and user\nacquisition/localization strategies.\n\nProfessor Tang’s research interests lie in applied & theoretical cryptography,\nprivacy and computer security. In particular: blockchain technology,\npost-Snowden cryptography, accountability, and information theoretic security.\n\nWhen looking for a qualified group of academics to focus on privacy on Particl’s\nblockchain we were very impressed by Qiang’s own research — which we encourage\nanyone to take the time to read through some of his papers and publications.\n\nQiang Tang [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#paper]\n2017.10.

Indeed, at 00:00\nUTC, the Particl blockchain will hardfork to bring many critical changes to its\nProof-of-Stake protocol, insuring that its foundation is as strong and secure as\npossible before the long-awaited Particl privacy marketplace is released. The\ntwo main changes to the protocol are the introduction of cold staking and a\ndramatic increase in quantum computer resistance. The hardfork also enables\nprotocol support for staking pools and staking rewards management, meaning that\nwhile they will now be able to be implemented, they will not be present at the\ntime of the fork.\n\nParticl’s 10th of November Hardfork in one imageCold Staking\nThe main feature the hardfork will bring to Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol is\nthe ability to securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes”. The purpose\nof these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the\nParticl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to\nspend its coins.\n\nThe reason it is called “cold staking” is because this feature is intended to be\nused in combination with cold/hardware/paper wallets as well as multisig\naddresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being\nhacked.\n\nStaking nodes can be set up on public/cloud servers, virtual machines or even on\nRPIs. The staking environment theoretically doesn’t even need to be that much\nsecure since these nodes do not contain or cannot be linked to any coin, meaning\nthat you can pretty much stake from anywhere.\n\nIn the future, this feature is likely to become even more relevant when the\nParticl team will start developing the mobile wallet. This wallet is intended to\nhave most or all of the desktop features, but actually staking from a mobile\nphone is far from being ideal. Not only would the network connection be unstable\nat times, it would also use a lot of data as you’d need to constantly download\nevery blocks. With cold staking, you could simply stake your mobile funds from a\nRPI at home or any dedicated server and still get staking revenues from your\nmobile funds without busting the phone bill.\n\nQuantum Resistance\nCurrent Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in\nProof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they\nfind and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against\npublic key cryptography. On traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128\nbasic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public\nkeys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional\ncomputers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would\ntake a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic\nquantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm.\nThis might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are\nlikely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical. It could be\nestimated that it is maybe 2 to 5 years until quantum computers become an issue,\nbut any project that plans on staying relevant on a long period of time should\ntackle these vulnerabilities way before they become problematic.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that public keys are NOT public addresses. To reverse a\nprivate key from a public address, it would require more energy than what is\navailable in the universe, therefore a quantum hacker cannot just go pick public\naddresses with large amounts and reverse those.\n\nWhen a Particl block is created, the private key of the address that staked it\nis used to sign the block, effectively broadcasting its public key to the entire\nnetwork. After the hardfork, “staking nodes” that do not contain any coin will\nbe able to sign staked blocks on behalf of any wallet, hot or cold. Even if a\nquantum hacker successfully did reverse the staking node’s private key from its\npublic key, he would not find any coin to steal.\n\nStaking Pools (Protocol Support Only)\nOne very practical use case this hardfork enables is that it enables protocol\nsupport for staking pools. It means this feature will not be available at the\ntime of the fork, but is rendered possible to code due to the changes brought by\nthe hardfork.\n\nIt may not be immediately obvious why staking pools would be useful when you can\nsecurely stake from anywhere, but there are a couple of reasons some users may\nbe drawn towards using them. First of all, staking a low Particl balance may not\nalways be ideal. Since each staking reward is around 1.5 PART and the minimum\nyearly interest is 5%, there could be a lot of time in between staking rewards.\nFor example, if someone wanted to buy $500 worth of Particl priced at 25$, he\nwould end up with 20 PARTs. At 5% inflation rate, that person would earn around\n1 Particl a year, which is even less than a single staking reward.\n\nSimilarly to PoW mining where solo mining Bitcoin with a single GPU card is now\ncompletely impractical, users with small Particl balances could simply delegate\nstaking powers to pools and have them stake their coins on their behalf. As\nmentioned above, this will not be coded at the time of the fork, but it would be\npossible to configure staking nodes to be able to spend staking rewards only (no\naccess to the actual staking funds whatsoever).\n\nA pool operator could simply broadcast its staking node’s public key and have\nusers “connect” and stake from it. Since these nodes could spend the rewards but\nnot the staking funds, the pool operators could simply aggregate staking rewards\ninto their own wallets and make custom payouts (i.e. daily or small 0.05 PART\npayouts).\n\nAnother use-case for staking pools is that the entire process of setting up and\nmaintaining a secure staking node is outsourced to the pool operator. Users\nwould only need to “connect” to the staking pool and not have to worry about\nsetting up their own server/RPI. This is ideal for the less technical users that\nmay eventually end up using Particl.\n\nThe current problem with staking pools is the transaction fees. Since the goal\nis to send smaller than 1.5 PART payouts, there may be a point where sending\nvery small payouts would cost too much in terms of transaction fee. This is an\nissue that could easily be solved with the Lightning Network. Payment channels\ncould be opened between users and the pool wallets and could eventually achieve\nnear-zero transaction costs.\n\nStake To Alternative Address(es) (Protocol Support Only)\nA second powerful but underestimated feature the hardfork adds protocol support\nfor is the ability to fully manage staking rewards. This allows users to select\nwhere the rewards should go and in what percentage. This function will not be\ncoded at the time of the fork, but it will now be possible to do it.\n\nBy default, staking rewards are given to the same address that stake (find and\nsign) a block. With this “alternative address” feature enabled, users would be\nable to automatically have these staking rewards sent to any public addresses\nand in any percentage. This killer feature leverages the amazing power of the\nParticl Proof-of-Stake protocol and enables a brand new way to spend, invest and\ndonate money in a completely passive way. Here are a couple of examples that I\nbelieve could really help the Particl project make a name for itself:\n\n1) Passive donations to crypto influencers\nThis, in my opinion, is a very powerful grassroots marketing strategy. The idea\nis to have crypto public figures such as youtubers or crypto celebs get a\nParticl address and share it. Then any Particl staker can choose the\ninfluencer’s address as a receiver of X% of his staking rewards. If enough\nstakers participate, the aggregated effect could make these passive donations\nquite large. If a crypto youtuber received 500$ worth of Particl everyday for\nsome time, he’s for sure going to look in to the project at one point and the\nother and then maybe start talking about it.\n\n2) Passive funding of community initiatives\nAnother brilliant way to use this potential feature is by creating community\nfunds and bounties. If a community member has an idea for a Particl Dapp,\nwidget, integration or marketing idea he could simply set up a public address\nand have X% of his staking rewards sent to it. If his idea gains traction within\nthe community, other stakers could also start funding the initiative’s address\nand eventually create a sizable bounty to attract contributors. Combined with\nParticl’s decentralized voting, it is an entire decentralized ecosystem that\nenables the users to make things happen and get ideas funded without the need of\nany middleman.\n\n3) Passive donations to organizations\nThis use-case is a bit more philanthropic, but practical nonetheless. Passive\ndonations could be set up to any organization or charity that sets up a Particl\npublic address. These organizations could be, for example, ones that seeks to\nfight for privacy and security like the TOR organization or the EFF. Not only\nwould this help them accomplish their goals, but it would also be a good\nmarketing strategy as many of these organizations display/showcase their big\ndonors.\n\n4) Budgeting & Diversification\nMany addresses could be set up with different purposes and be passively funded\nusing Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol. This would make it easier for stakers\nto save or invest money and would be an ideal budgeting strategy. For example, a\nuser could set up a “Vacations Fund”, “Real Estate Downpayment Fund” or a\n“University Fund” and have any percentage of their daily staking rewards sent\nover there. Then, once they would reach their respective funding target, the\nfunds they hold could be traded for fiat and then used to fulfil the goal they\nwere initially created for. Alternatively, this same user could also set up a\n“Bitcoin Investment Fund” or “altcoin Investment Fund” where every week the\nPARTs they hold would be traded for BTCs or other altcoins using a GUI in-wallet\ntoken exchange application (such as Changelly, Shapeshift or flyp.me). This\nwould make it easy for stakers to diversify their holdings into different coins\nwhile at the same time providing exchanges with more liquidity and volume\n\nWhile not implemented yet, this is how Shapeshift would look on the\nParticl walletParticl currently has ~1.5 PART staking rewards and blocks of 2\nminutes, meaning that roughly 1080 PARTs are created everyday. Priced at 7.50$,\nit is worth $8,100 and this daily source of funds will keep growing in value as\nParticl’s price increases. If enough stakers use this feature as a marketing\nstrategy, the aggregated effect it could generate would definitely get people\ntalking. You can only last so long not digging into a project that is funding\nyou hundreds of dollars everyday!\n\nThe hardfork is scheduled for November 10th 2017, 00:00 UTC so make sure you\nupgrade your client to at least version 0.15.2 before that time. You do not need\nto move any wallet file, simply run the client from the updated folder! Since\nthe Particl marketplace will also require a hardfork, it will be interesting to\nobserve how the cold staking hardfork will unfold. At the time of this writing,\n54% of the network has updated, so it seems things should go smoothly.","html":"<p>Particl, a decentralized privacy platform and cryptocurrency, is just about to go through its first hardfork on the 10th of November 2017.

Indeed, at 00:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain will hardfork to bring many critical changes to its Proof-of-Stake protocol, insuring that its foundation is as strong and secure as possible before the long-awaited Particl privacy marketplace is released. The two main changes to the protocol are the introduction of cold staking and a dramatic increase in quantum computer resistance. The hardfork also enables protocol support for staking pools and staking rewards management, meaning that while they will now be able to be implemented, they will not be present at the time of the fork.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-10th-of-November-Hardfork--Cold-Staking---Quantum-Resistance/1-y9pBRrNFWhMCSE2i49Jsiw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s 10th of November Hardfork in one image</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"cold-staking\">Cold Staking</h2><p>The main feature the hardfork will bring to Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol is the ability to securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes”. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the Particl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins.</p><p>The reason it is called “cold staking” is because this feature is intended to be used in combination with cold/hardware/paper wallets as well as multisig addresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being hacked.</p><p>Staking nodes can be set up on public/cloud servers, virtual machines or even on RPIs. The staking environment theoretically doesn’t even need to be that much secure since these nodes do not contain or cannot be linked to any coin, meaning that you can pretty much stake from anywhere.</p><p>In the future, this feature is likely to become even more relevant when the Particl team will start developing the mobile wallet. This wallet is intended to have most or all of the desktop features, but actually staking from a mobile phone is far from being ideal. Not only would the network connection be unstable at times, it would also use a lot of data as you’d need to constantly download every blocks. With cold staking, you could simply stake your mobile funds from a RPI at home or any dedicated server and still get staking revenues from your mobile funds without busting the phone bill.</p><h2 id=\"quantum-resistance\">Quantum Resistance</h2><p>Current Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in Proof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they find and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against public key cryptography. On traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128 basic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public keys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional computers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would take a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm. This might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are likely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical.
