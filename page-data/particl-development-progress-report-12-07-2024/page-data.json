we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe've made significant progress on developing the decentralized, LLM-powered\nmoderation tool for the marketplace. Currently, we have two developers assigned\nto the task: one focusing on the LLM component and the other on\nmarketplace-related adjustments.\n\nWe understand that the community has questions about the system's design and\nwhether it will maintain the marketplace's decentralized and private ethos.\nWhile we plan to release an in-depth blog post explaining all details before the\nsystem's launch, we'd like to provide some additional information now.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation v0.2\nIt's important to understand that the current system will remain in place. Even\nwith upcoming changes, it will still be possible to manually upvote and downvote\nlistings directly in the application.\n\nWhen first released, this system was announced as v0.1, with future iterations\nplanned. Effective moderation of a decentralized system without third-party bias\nis challenging, and what we're working on is essentially v0.2 of that system.\n\nThis new version will use the same downvote/upvote mechanism where listings are\nremoved from the marketplace's interface once they reach a negative threshold,\nbut with more automation, resulting in a much improved user experience.\n\nPro-Active Moderation\nThe updated system will run on staking nodes, and the Partyman cold staking\napplication will likely include a script to guide users through enabling the\nsystem, setting moderation policies and rules, and consulting moderation\nhistory.\n\nWhen enabled, the system will scan the marketplace and extract individual\nlisting titles and descriptions, which will be processed through a decentralized\nLLM network to test against the user's moderation policies.\n\nThis improved version will ensure more effective and proactive marketplace\nmoderation while reducing reliance on manual user interaction.\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, more effective, automated content moderation will\nreduce encounters with undesirable listings before delisting them, benefiting\nmarketplace adoption and directly addressing a theoretical attack vector.\n\nAbsolute Decentralization\nWe've noted concerns about the new system's level of decentralization and\nwhether users will need to create accounts with AI service providers or run\nresource-intensive open-source models locally.\n\nRest assured, our innovative solution requires neither accounts nor local LLM\ninstances. It utilizes a decentralized network of voluntary GPUs collectively\nrunning Llama-based models. Staking nodes will simply send messages to this\ndecentralized LLM network and receive appropriate responses, which will then be\nprocessed by the rest of the moderation system.\n\nIn other words, decentralization and privacy remain intact, with no compromises\ncaused by the new changes.\n\nUpvoting and Downvoting\nOnce a response is received from the LLM network, the node will use the\nassociated wallet's staking weight to upvote, downvote, or ignore the listing.\nThe marketplace will tally votes for each listing, and if the negative threshold\nis reached, it will be removed, as per the current system.\n\nListings can also be upvoted to counterbalance downvotes, and the delisting\nthreshold will be adjusted to account for the expected increased participation\nrate.\n\nUpcoming Blog Post\nWe'll publish a detailed blog post shortly before releasing this new version of\nthe moderation system, including diagrams, in-depth information, and usage\nguides.\n\nWe're confident this new system will improve the user experience by reducing the\nmoderation burden on end users while also improving efficiency.\n\nDisabling of Public Markets and Storefronts\nWe've also noticed concerns regarding a specific commit made in June to Particl\nMarketplace that would disable public markets and storefronts.\n\nThis commit was initially pushed as a proactive measure to prevent potential\nabuse of Particl Marketplace in case we couldn't rapidly improve the moderation\nsystem.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this commit has not yet been included in\nany release and, given our satisfactory progress on the new version of the\nmoderation system, it now appears that implementing it will not be necessary.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
