cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

Due to changes in the data structure of\nBasicSwap-related SMSG messages, previous instances of the DEX are not\nforward-compatible with this new version. This means that offers posted from\nupdated instances will not appear on older instances. All users must update to\nmaintain full network connectivity.\nAfter 171 commits over 164 files changed coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4], we are\nexcited to announce the release of a significant BasicSwap update (v0.14.4)\nalong with an update to its user interface, now at version 3.2.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, new features, and significant refactors of\ndifferent core components of the system. The changes stem from extensive testing\nby both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step\nforward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nNoteworthy Updates ?\nWhile this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to\nimprove efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several\nsignificant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.\n\nVarious Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX.\nWhether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we\nhighly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.\n\nSignificant UI Refactor ?️\nA major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple\nof weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better\npractices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented\nnumerous UI upgrades, including:\n\n * Local reputation tracking\n * Enhanced order book formatting with additional information\n * New Bids page\n * Improved Swaps in Progress page\n * Better Offer pages\n * More responsive and dynamic page behavior\n * Better rate fetching\n * Much more...\n\nThe interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and\nyou'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.\n\nClient Authentication ?\nWe've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client\nauthentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a\npassword of your choosing. \n\nThis is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the\nmarket-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely\ntrust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation\ndocumentation.\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWe've pushed to master the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support\nfor BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure\nupdate to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called\n\"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages\nacross multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network\nexperiences high load.\n\nSince all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even\nnon-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without\ncompromising user privacy or security.\n\nThis new functionality delivers several key benefits:\n\n 1. Improved platform scalability and resilience\n 2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use\n    their preferred compatible networks for message relay\n 3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to\n    operate on the same network during swaps\n\nWhile the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before\nthe implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using\nSimplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific\nrecipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.\n\nThe core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various\nnetworks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency,\nalthough additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG\nmessages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting\npre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through\nP2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex\nnetworks.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its\nflexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be)\nfully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like\nTelegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols\nare particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth\nnoting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some\ninformation pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each\nother.\n\nAcceptance Strategy Knowledge ?\nWhen publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest\nof the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to\nautomatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page\nbefore submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which\noffers to bid on.\n\nPlease note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be\nable to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your\nBasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However,\noffer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so\nupgrading now carries no downside.\n\nDocs ?️\nWe've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses\nReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at \ndocs.basicswapdex.com [https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/]. While we'll\nmaintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates\nwill be provided at the new location.\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\nDue to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related\nmessages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in\nyour instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.\n\nTo install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface\nupdates, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/user-guides/update] (video walkthrough\n[https://youtu.be/obxcmEby64s?si=-kFNfEIJx8yQYJhP]) and launch the DEX again.\n\nDocker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image (docker-compose stop),\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build --no-cache command,\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\n> Note: Depending on your Docker version, adding a dash between docker and compose \nmay not be necessary and may instead throw an error.\nNon-Docker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the non-Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly,\n * From the ~/coinswaps/basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * Execute the following command: pip install --require-hashes -r\n   requirements.txt,\n * Execute the following command: pip3 install .,\n * Launch BasicSwap as usual.\n\nInstall Script\n> If you've installed BasicSwap using Nahuhh's Github installation script\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/]...\n * Execute the update command: bsx-update && bsx-update.\n\nChangelog ?\nCoin(s)\n * Bitcoin — Added support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets\n * Bitcoin — Update Bitcoins' fast sync blockchain file\n * Bitcoin — Add a workaround to prevent Bitcoin wallets' seeds changing after\n   enabling encryption\n * Bitcoin Cash — Upgraded Bitcoin Cash node to version 28.0.1\n * Bitcoin Cash — Refresh BCH keypool\n * Monero — Upgrade Monero node to version 0.18.4.0\n * Monero — Corrupt Monero wallets are now detected\n * Monero — Remove inaccurate fee rates for Monero and hide sweep all checkbox\n * Monero — Make Monero's fork height a transient error\n * Monero — Sets Monero's trusted_daemon setting to true by default\n * Litecoin — Fixed a bug with MWEB wallet generation\n * PIVX — Fixed issues with PIVX\n * Namecoin — Large array of fixes and improvements to the Namecoin integration\n * Wownero — Fixed Wownero's Windows download URL\n * Fixed a reseed wallet regression error\n\nAPI\n * Better handling of errors with the API\n * Fixed bug with Firo's API\n * Simplified API requests\n * Identities API updated\n * Use CryptoCompare pricemulti endpoint for multiple coins\n * Reduced lookupFiatRates debug message\n\nUI Code\n * Fixed various memory leaks and improved memory efficiency\n * Major UI refactor;

The changes stem from extensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step forward for user experience and platform stability.</p><h2 id=\"noteworthy-updates-\">Noteworthy Updates ?</h2><p>While this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to improve efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several significant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.</p><h3 id=\"various-coin-core-updates-\">Various Coin Core Updates ✅</h3><p>We've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX. Whether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we highly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.</p><h3 id=\"significant-ui-refactor-\">Significant UI Refactor ?️</h3><p>A major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple of weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better practices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented numerous UI upgrades, including:</p><ul><li>Local reputation tracking</li><li>Enhanced order book formatting with additional information</li><li>New Bids page</li><li>Improved Swaps in Progress page</li><li>Better Offer pages</li><li>More responsive and dynamic page behavior</li><li>Better rate fetching</li><li>Much more...</li></ul><p>The interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and you'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.</p><h3 id=\"client-authentication-\">Client Authentication ?</h3><p>We've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client authentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a password of your choosing. </p><p>This is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the market-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely trust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation documentation.</p><h3 id=\"multi-net-support-\">Multi-Net Support ?</h3><p>We've pushed to <code class=\"language-text\">master</code> the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support for BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure update to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called \"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.</p><p>Since all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even non-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without compromising user privacy or security.</p><p>This new functionality delivers several key benefits:</p><ol><li>Improved platform scalability and resilience</li><li>Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use their preferred compatible networks for message relay</li><li>Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to operate on the same network during swaps</li></ol><p>While the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before the implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using Simplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific recipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.</p><p>The core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various networks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency, although additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG messages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting pre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through P2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex networks.</p><p>Not to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its flexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be) fully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like Telegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols are particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth noting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some information pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each other.</p><h3 id=\"acceptance-strategy-knowledge-\">Acceptance Strategy Knowledge ?</h3><p>When publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest of the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to automatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page before submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which offers to bid on.</p><p>Please note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be able to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your BasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However, offer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so upgrading now carries no downside.</p><h3 id=\"docs-\">Docs ?️</h3><p>We've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses ReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at <a href=\"https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/\">docs.basicswapdex.com</a>. While we'll maintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates will be provided at the new location.</p><h2 id=\"install-the-latest-basicswap-update-\">Install the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️</h2><p>Due to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related messages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in your instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.</p><p>To install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface updates, simply <a

an\nupdate to its user interface, now at version 3.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing\nmoderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core\nvalues of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden\non users.\n\nBuilt using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It\nanalyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models,\nrequiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your\ndata stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively\nto Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing\nenvironment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or\nvirtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.\n\nYou can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: \nhttps://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\n\nHow We Got Here: The Current Moderation System\nThis release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system\n(v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users'\nhands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the\nplatform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and\npro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.\n\nThe current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some\nconceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial\ndifferences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users\nencounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the\napplication, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public\nlist where the community can either support the original flag through additional\ndownvotes or contest it with upvotes.\n\nContent removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary\ndecisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of\nParticl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply\nof 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000\ncoins to be removed.\n\nImportantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since\nParticl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple\naddresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the\nvoting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated\nwithin an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote\ncarries.\n\nAddressing Current Limitations\nWhile this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its\ncontinued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:\n\nFirst, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain\neffective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can\nlead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.\n\nSecond, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must\nbe exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it.\nWhile early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary\ntrade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant\nbarrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.\n\nThese challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to\ndecentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving\nthe marketplace experience.\n\nThe Promise of Local LLM Technology\nThe breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology.\nWhile the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT,\nAnthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's\nprivacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean\nhigher total API costs.\n\nIndeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models.\nThese models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving\naccuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever\nconnecting to third-party service providers.\n\nThis technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve\nParticl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without\ncompromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through\nAPIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced\nscaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.\n\nThe New Automated Moderation Script\nGitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered\ncontent moderation script for Particl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without\nconnections to 3rd-parties.Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for\nParticl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without connections to 3rd-parties. -\ncryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-scriptGitHubcryptoguard\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script]We’re proud to\nintroduce, today, a new script that automates the process of moderating Particl\nMarketplace content with minimal user input.\n\nOperating Modes\nThe script offers two distinct approaches to marketplace moderation: manual mode \nand continuous mode.\n\nScript's main menuIn manual mode, you maintain complete control through a CLI menu interface that\nlets you oversee each step of the process. This gives you the ability to review\nand adjust moderation decisions before they reach the network, making it\nespecially valuable during your initial setup phase or when testing new\nmoderation rules.\n\nOptions for the script's manual modeContinuous mode transforms this process into an autonomous operation. The script\nindependently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings,\nanalyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the\nnetwork. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace\nscan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces\nuser exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only\nafter thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.\n\nRule System and Analysis\nAt the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule\nsystem powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor\nmarketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria.\nEach rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving\nyou precise control over the moderation process.\n\nThe system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language\ndescriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters.\nTo help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules\naccessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing\nimmediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can\nuse them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or\nentirely replace them with custom rules of your own.\n\nFor those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of\ntest listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to\nprohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the\ntest. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules\nbefore deploying them in the live marketplace.\n\nThe Judgement Engine\nProcessed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely\nuser-defined)The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to\ncontent analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and\ndescriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than\nusing potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when\nclassifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true',\n'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible\nand unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without\npredetermined assumptions.\n\nModel Selection and Performance\nAfter extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the\noptimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates\nremarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including\nseveral state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being\nvictim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it\nto run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to\nvirtual private servers.\n\nOur commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making\neffective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge.\nWe're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to\nfurther optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains\nunclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if\nany.\n\nWallet Configuration\nThe script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin controlTo operate\neffectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an\nactive Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up\nyour wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.\n\nThe first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which\nstreamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a\nParticl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves\nspecifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and\ninitializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and\nNode Settings/Initialize Wallet).\n\nThe initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It\nincorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling\nsecure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for\nboth accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system.\nWithout proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings\nor cast votes on content.\n\nVote Broadcasting System\nThe process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach\ndesigned to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the\nfirst time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the\nLLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu,\nwhere you can examine each decision in detail.\n\nDuring this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated\ndecisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves\nparticularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique\ncontent patterns.\n\nOnce satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting\nprocess through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in\nyour wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins\ncontained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically,\nensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the\nintegrity of your voting decisions.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use this application without running a local model? \nA: Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU\nnetwork running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option\nin the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider\navailability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the\ncommunity-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation\nperformance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this\nspace for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent\ncompromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its\nminimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like\nRaspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.\n\nQ: How is my data and privacy protected? \nA: Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script\nconnects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data\ncollection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision\nencoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which\naddresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy\nand data security principles, which guided the script's development.\n\nQ: What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? \nA: Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we\nemphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new\nmoderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until\nyou're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides\nan excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM\ninterprets different content types.\n\nQ: Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? \nA: Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority.\nBuilt using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The\ninstallation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all\ndependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's\nexisting Python packages or other software.\n\nQ: What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous\nmode? \nA: The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it\nto resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will\nautomatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime,\nensuring no content goes unprocessed.\n\nQ: How much storage space does the local LLM model require? \nA: The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The\nscript's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies,\nneed roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about\n2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to\naccommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.\n\nQ: What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? \nA: For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:\n\n * RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)\n * Storage: 6GB free space\n * Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity\n\nNote: The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be\nsignificantly reduced.\n\nQ: How does the script handle network connectivity issues? \nA: The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the\nmarketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at\nregular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored\nlocally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and\nprocesses any listings it missed during the downtime.\n\nQ: Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? \nA: Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their\nown wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each\ninstance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool\naccording to its wallet's stake.\n\nQ: How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? \nA: The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config\ndirectory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the\nrules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or\nused to recover your setup if needed.\n\nQ: Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data? \nA: No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond\nthe expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings\nthan what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided\ntest listings (available from the CLI menu).\n\nQ: How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? \nA: LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and\ninitiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become\navailable, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided\nthat you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).\n\nLooking Forward\nThe release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in\ndecentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve\neffective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy,\ndecentralization, and user autonomy.\n\nThis development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It\nshows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while\nminimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized\ncontrol. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and\nits privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other\ndecentralized projects facing similar challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community\nfeedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the\npotential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates,\nand further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even\nmore efficient and user-friendly.\n\nYour feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this\ntool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in\ndecentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with\ndifferent rules, and share your experiences with the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU network running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option in the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider availability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the community-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation performance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this space for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent compromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its minimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like Raspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is my data and privacy protected? <br><strong>A:</strong> Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script connects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data collection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision encoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which addresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy and data security principles, which guided the script's development.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? <br><strong>A:</strong> Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we emphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new moderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until you're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides an excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM interprets different content types.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority. Built using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The installation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all dependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's existing Python packages or other software.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous mode? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it to resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing moderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core values of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden on users.</p><p>Built using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It analyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models, requiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your data stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively to Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing environment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or virtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.</p><p><strong>You can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\">https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script</a></strong></p><h2 id=\"how-we-got-here-the-current-moderation-system\"><strong>How We Got Here: The Current Moderation System</strong></h2><p>This release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system (v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users' hands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the platform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and pro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p><p>The current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some conceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial differences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users encounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the application, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public list where the community can either support the original flag through additional downvotes or contest it with upvotes.</p><p>Content removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary decisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of Particl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply of 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000 coins to be removed.</p><p>Importantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since Particl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple addresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the voting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated within an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote carries.</p><h2 id=\"addressing-current-limitations\"><strong>Addressing Current Limitations</strong></h2><p>While this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its continued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:</p><p>First, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain effective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can lead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.</p><p>Second, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must be exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it. While early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary trade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant barrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.</p><p>These challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to decentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving the marketplace experience.</p><h2 id=\"the-promise-of-local-llm-technology\"><strong>The Promise of Local LLM Technology</strong></h2><p>The breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology. While the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean higher total API costs.</p><p>Indeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models. These models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving accuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever connecting to third-party service providers.</p><p>This technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve Particl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without compromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through APIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced scaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.</p><h1 id=\"the-new-automated-moderation-script\">The New Automated Moderation Script</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for Particl Marketplace.

The script independently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings, analyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the network. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace scan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces user exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only after thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.</p><h3 id=\"rule-system-and-analysis\"><strong>Rule System and Analysis</strong></h3><p>At the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule system powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor marketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria. Each rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving you precise control over the moderation process.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BGhzhwa8wQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Automated and LLM-powered marketplace content moderation script\"></iframe></figure><p>The system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language descriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters. To help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules accessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing immediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can use them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or entirely replace them with custom rules of your own.</p><p>For those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of test listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to prohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the test. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules before deploying them in the live marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"the-judgement-engine\"><strong>The Judgement Engine</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2024/11/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2024/11/image-6.png 600w, /glink/2024/11/image-6.png 671w\"><figcaption><em>Processed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely user-defined)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to content analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and descriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than using potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when classifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true', 'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible and unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without predetermined assumptions.</p><h3 id=\"model-selection-and-performance\"><strong>Model Selection and Performance</strong></h3><p>After extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the optimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates remarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including several state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being victim of strong bias during training).

When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

proposal has been passed with\nsuccess. We're happy to report a 84.5% approval rate with a 50% participation\nrate. Thanks to everyone that has voted!\nAs we close the chapter on our fourth funding cycle, we're thrilled to announce\nour fifth funding request. This new funding request\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] marks a new phase for\nParticl, with a renewed strategy for innovation and growth within the PART\necosystem. In this post, we will outline our proposal and share our vision for\nthe coming months.\n\nTeam Funding Request 5\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-5.html]The funding\nproposal is live on the CCS platform [https://ccs.particl.io/] and is now open\nfor community comments. Voting will start soon and will last for 5,040 blocks\n(approximately one week). We will notify you a few days before the voting period\nbegins. In the meantime, you can review the proposal and share your thoughts by\nfollowing this link [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19].\n\n> Reminder: The CCS platform is open to all. We encourage you to submit proposals\nfor treasury funds to support projects that improve and benefit the Particl\necosystem.\nTable of Contents\n * Milestones from the Fourth Funding Cycle\n * Current Priorities and Ongoing Initiatives\n * Detailed Funding Request\n * How to Vote\n * Looking Ahead: A Bright Future for Particl\n\nMilestones from the Fourth Funding Cycle\nThe past year has been foundational for Particl, especially with regards to how\nwe’ve been able to strategically position BasicSwap in such a way that will\ndirectly benefit the wider PART ecosystem. These developments and their\nrelevance for the project and its continuation will be expanded further down\nthis blog post.\n\nHere are some highlights of our achievements since the last funding cycle:\n\n * Particl added to MEXC (PART/USDT)\n   [https://particl.news/part-usdt-listed-on-mexc/]\n * Large number of updates to BasicSwap's codebase and GUI\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/master/]\n * Particl and BasicSwap join the PFS\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-joins-pfs/]\n * BasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows\n   [https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases/]\n * Talks at Monerokon (2023\n   [https://particl.news/monerokon-2023-presentation-kewde/] and 2024\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-at-monerokon-2024/])\n * Litecoin MWEB balances added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * BasicSwap on stage at the 2024 Litecoin Summit\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-to-present-at-litecoin-summit-2024/]\n * Decred added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/decred-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * Wownero added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/wownero-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\nOngoing Initiatives and Current Priorities\nEmbracing New Opportunities with BasicSwap\nWhile we recently encountered challenges in the development of Particl\nMarketplace, notably in terms of developer availability, these obstacles have\nled us to devote more time and effort towards BasicSwap. This strategic pivot\nhas allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a\nlevel of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and\necosystem revenue.\n\nWith this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving\nthe DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow\nBasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party\napplications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These\nefforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and\nutility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent\nPART price fluctuations.\n\nInnovative Funding Strategies\nThe recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've\nalso sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.\n\nIndeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize\nBasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community,\nwithout introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX\n(decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).\n\nOur immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for\nBasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART\ndonations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various\nstrategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning,\nexternal revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar\nmechanisms.\n\nIn other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its\ncontributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable\nenvironment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors,\nand the project as a whole.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the\nBasicSwap protocol free and open. Our monetization efforts are solely targeted\nat third-party integrations, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both\nthe community and our partners.\n\nDiversifying Funding Sources\nWe're also making strides in securing non-PART donations from communities that\nshare our vision and/or want to be integrated into BasicSwap.\n\nFor instance, one of our beloved community contributors, Ofrnxmr, has recently\nsubmitted a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/ofrnxmr_basicswap.html] to the Monero\ncommunity that got funded, and we've also received a donation\n[https://proposals.decred.org/record/0757fea] from the Decred community\nfollowing our successful integration of their coin into BasicSwap.\n\nThese initiatives are part of our broader strategy to achieve full\nself-sustainability and reduce — or, in the best of cases, completely eliminate\n— our reliance on the network treasury over time while improving our products\nfor the benefit of all.\n\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThese upcoming changes are the reason we are proposing a shorter team funding\ncycle this time around.\n\nIndeed, this proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] seeks a\nmonthly allocation of 35,250 PART from the Treasury Fund for a 6-month period.\nThis funding will support the Particl team and fuel our operations as we work\ntowards our goals of integration and self-sustainability.\n\nWe've opted for a 6-month funding request in order to provide stability for our\ncurrent projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while allowing\nflexibility for potential external funding opportunities and team expansion. \nThis timeframe also gives our community the chance to discuss and propose\nmodifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.\n\nFund Allocation\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to support the\necosystem and its dApps.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nAcknowledging Community Discussions on Treasury and Emission\nWe're aware of the ongoing community discussions regarding potential changes to\nthe treasury system, its parameters, and/or the blockchain's coin emission rate.\nThese conversations are crucial for the long-term sustainability and health of\nthe Particl ecosystem, and we strongly encourage their continuation.\n\nOur decision to request funding for a shorter 6-month period, as opposed to a\n12-month period as was the case with previous proposals, aligns directly with\nthese discussions. It provides the flexibility needed to pursue our new funding\nstrategy and adapt to any potential changes that may arise from community-driven\nproposals. We believe that this shorter claim period strikes a healthy balance\nbetween ensuring the continued, uninterrupted development of Particl and\nremaining responsive to the evolving needs and decisions of the community.\n\nHow to Vote\nWe encourage all stakeholders to participate in this crucial decision-making\nprocess. To cast your vote on proposal #24\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24], we recommend using the\npartyman cold staking application to register your vote on the blockchain.\n\nYou have three options:\n\n * Abstain (0)\n * Vote in favor (1)\n * Vote against (2)\n\nEvery vote counts! Higher participation ensures a broader consensus and a\nhealthier decision-making process for our entire community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running its latest version. To do so, \nrun git pull from inside your partyman folder, and then type the ./partyman\nupdate command from that same partyman folder.\nLooking Ahead: A Bright Future for Particl\nThe challenges we've faced recently have only strengthened our resolve and led\nus towards innovative solutions that will benefit our entire ecosystem.\n\nOur focus on BasicSwap integration, coupled with our efforts to diversify\nfunding and optimize our economic model, sets the stage for a resurgence of\nParticl and a renewed growth, much like the phoenix reborn from its ashes.

This strategic pivot has allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a level of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and ecosystem revenue.</p><p>With this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving the DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow BasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party applications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These efforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and utility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent PART price fluctuations.</p><h3 id=\"innovative-funding-strategies\"><strong>Innovative Funding Strategies</strong></h3><p>The recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've also sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.</p><p>Indeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize BasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community, without introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX (decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).</p><p>Our immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for BasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART donations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various strategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning, external revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar mechanisms.</p><p>In other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its contributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable environment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors, and the project as a whole.</p><p><strong>It's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the BasicSwap protocol free and open. Our monetization efforts are solely targeted at third-party integrations, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both the community and our partners.</strong></p><h3 id=\"diversifying-funding-sources\"><strong>Diversifying Funding Sources</strong></h3><p>We're also making strides in securing non-PART donations from communities that share our vision and/or want to be integrated into BasicSwap.</p><p>For instance, one of our beloved community contributors, Ofrnxmr, has recently submitted a <a href=\"https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/ofrnxmr_basicswap.html\">CCS proposal</a> to the Monero community that got funded, and we've also <a href=\"https://proposals.decred.org/record/0757fea\">received a donation</a> from the Decred community following our successful integration of their coin into BasicSwap.</p><p>These initiatives are part of our broader strategy to achieve full self-sustainability and reduce — or, in the best of cases, completely eliminate — our reliance on the network treasury over time while improving our products for the benefit of all.</p><h2 id=\"the-funding-request-in-detail\"><strong>The Funding Request in Detail</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>These upcoming changes are the reason we are proposing a shorter team funding cycle this time around.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24\">this proposal</a> seeks a monthly allocation of <strong>35,250 PART from the Treasury Fund for a 6-month period</strong>. This funding will support the Particl team and fuel our operations as we work towards our goals of integration and self-sustainability.</p><p>We've opted for a 6-month funding request in order to provide stability for our current projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while allowing flexibility for potential external funding opportunities and team expansion. <strong>This timeframe also gives our community the chance to discuss and propose modifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.</strong></p><h3 id=\"fund-allocation\"><strong>Fund Allocation</strong></h3><p>Given the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily allocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as cover various operational expenses.</p><p>Should the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be accumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of marketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to support the ecosystem and its dApps.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"acknowledging-community-discussions-on-treasury-and-emission\"><strong>Acknowledging Community Discussions on Treasury and Emission</strong></h3><p>We're aware of the ongoing community discussions regarding potential changes to the treasury system, its parameters, and/or the blockchain's coin emission rate.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy.

By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

thrilled to announce a major milestone: the initial phase of integrating\nLitecoin MWEB into BasicSwap DEX. With this latest update, users now have the\nability to send MWEB transactions to MWEB deposit addresses on BasicSwap and\neffortlessly convert coins between standard and MWEB balances.\n\nThis integration marks the first step in our commitment to fully integrate\nLitecoin MWEB atomic swaps into BasicSwap DEX. We are closely following\nLitecoin's upcoming major update — which is required for a full integration of\nMWEB swaps — and plan to incorporate full MWEB swaps as soon as feasible. \n\nOur goal is to support innovation in the cryptocurrency space, especially in\nregards to privacy, data protection, and pro-freedom initiatives, and we are\nconfident that adding Litecoin's MWEB capabilities to our DEX will go a long way\nin making this important privacy contribution from the Litecoin community more\naccessible to a wider audience. \n\nTable of Contents\n * How to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\n * Providing Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\n * (Contest) Win a Physical Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)\n * Dr. Kap to Speak at the Litecoin Summit 2024\n * About Litecoin's MWEB\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\nTo begin using Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap, you need to either install the DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html] \non your computer or update it to the latest version\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n. Detailed instructions for installation and updating can be found at the \nParticl Academy [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/index.html].\n\n> Note: If you're using Windows, you can use our all-in-one .exe installer here\n[https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI] which fully\nautomates the process: \nhttps://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases (latest\ninstaller version)\nOnce installed, navigate to the Wallets page on the DEX where you'll see all the\ncoins you've enabled. To manage your Litecoin wallet, click on the 'Manage\nWallet' button at the top right corner of the Litecoin tile. There, you'll find\nboth your standard and MWEB Litecoin deposit addresses. You can send your coins\nto these addresses as needed.\n\nTo switch coins between standard and MWEB balances, simply make a withdrawal\nfrom one address type to the other. This will create an internal transaction,\neffectively converting your balance between the two states.\n\nFor example, to transfer coins from your standard deposit address to your MWEB\naddress, simply copy and paste your MWEB address into the LTC address field,\nenter the number of LTC you want to transfer, and click on the Withdraw LTC\nbutton.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProviding Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\nWhile full MWEB swaps aren't yet an option on BasicSwap, you still have the\nability to swap Litecoin using either the Secret Hash method or the more\nprivacy-centric Adaptor Signature protocol for atomic swaps. This means you can\ntrade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX,\nincluding Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.\n\nTo make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a \ncompanion automated market making script\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts]. This tool runs in\ntandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book\nonce they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market\nrate. \n\nAdditionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers\nwith a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for\npassive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.\n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the\ncompanion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server.

Derived from the name 'MimbleWimble' originating from the\nHarry Potter series, this protocol was initially proposed by an anonymous user\nnamed Tom Elvis Jedusor in a Bitcoin research chatroom, signaling its roots in\nthe broader crypto community.\n\nTechnically, MWEB is distinct because it fundamentally alters how transactions\nare constructed in Litecoin's blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain models,\nwhere individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions\ninto a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential\ntransactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted.\nThe encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the\ntransaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel\napproach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to\nobscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.\n\nThe benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly\nenhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by\nobscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark\ncontrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin,\nwhere transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves\nscalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using\ncryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store\nexcessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the\nnetwork. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making\nLitecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This means you can trade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX, including Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.</p><p>To make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts\">companion automated market making script</a>. This tool runs in tandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book once they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market rate. </p><p>Additionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers with a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for passive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.</p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the companion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other people pick up your swap offers.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up.

cryptocurrency for\nanother in full privacy and without any counterparty risk at all. And to top it\nall, it's completely free to use.\n\nThe platform's unique benefits sure are drawing attention, but as it's still in\nthe early stages of development, some users find its quirks a bit challenging to\nwork with. This has unfortunately affected the liquidity available on the DEX's\norder book.\n\nTo help overcome these challenges and improve liquidity, we present you today\ntwo video tutorials that will show you how to smoothly run BasicSwap on a cloud\nserver and automate the process of providing liquidity on the DEX using\nBasicSwap's automated market making script. When combined together, this will\nlet you set your desired spread based on current market prices and potentially\nearn you arbitrage profits whenever other traders pick up your offers.\n\nIf you want to jump straight to the video tutorials, click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAddressing Some of BasicSwap's Main Challenges\nAs BasicSwap is currently in its beta phase, it's natural and expected that\nusers might need to put in extra effort to get it up and running. Fixing these\nobstacles is all a part of our development roadmap, and we're actively working\nto address them through ongoing updates; our goal being to evolve BasicSwap into\na highly user-friendly and intuitive trading platform.\n\nHowever, for those eager to leverage the benefits of BasicSwap today, there are\na few challenges to navigate in the meantime.\n\nThe Need to Run and Store BasicSwap Nodes Locally \nOne of the current challenges with BasicSwap is the necessity to run the DEX\nlocally. This can be resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU usage and storage\nspace as it requires running full nodes — and storing blockchains — for each\ncryptocurrency you wish to enable and swap.\n\nWhile BasicSwap works with pruned blockchains, which considerably reduce the\nstorage footprint, the DEX still demands several gigabytes of space. And while\nthis approach offers the highest level of security and privacy, it comes with\nsignificant resource requirements that may not be feasible for everyone.\n\nAnother consideration when running a full node is the need to keep your computer\nrunning continuously if you want your offers to remain visible on the order book\nand to execute swaps. This can be inconvenient for those who aim to provide\nliquidity reliably and continuously, and makes your setup vulnerable to power\ncuts and internet downtimes. \n\nThe Need to Manually Update and Republish Offers\nWith BasicSwap's current version, offers listed on the order book are\ntime-sensitive, expiring after a maximum of 48 hours. Once an offer expires, it\nrequires you to manually republish it so that it reappears on the order book.\nThis process sure can be cumbersome, especially for those looking to passively\nprovide liquidity and with hopes of earning profits from it.\n\nAdditionally, BasicSwap does not currently have a built-in feature for\nautomatically calculating current market rates for the trading pairs you offer.\nThis means each time you refresh your offers, you need to manually determine the\nmarket rates, another potentially time-consuming task especially when working\nwith multiple pairs.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a 24/7 BasicSwap Cloud Instance\nAs we progress in our development roadmap, addressing these challenges and\nimproving the user experience to make the DEX more intuitive is a top priority.\n\nIndeed, our roadmap includes plans to enable light nodes, remote services, web\ngateways, and the integration of advanced market making strategies directly into\nthe DEX, among other items.\n\nBut in the meantime, we understand the importance of providing immediate\nsolutions to these issues. To that end, we have prepared two specific video\ntutorials that are designed to help you navigate through the aformentioned\nchallenges effectively, offering practical solutions that you can implement\nright away. \n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first step is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is\nextremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your\ncomputer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your\npersonal computer.\n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting\nthe costs via any potential trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThe second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This\nallows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated\nmanner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\nand add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential profits\nwhenever people pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node and providing liquidity to the DEX entirely effortless once the\ninitial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy the\nmarket making script, and earn arbitrage profits as people trade using your\nliquidity.\n\nWhy Providing Liquidity is Important\nBasicSwap, as an order book-based DEX, significantly differs from Automated\nMarket Maker (AMM) style exchanges. While AMM DEXs can achieve deeper liquidity\nthrough algorithmic aggregation of all provided liquidity, they face several\ncritical issues that BasicSwap effectively addresses. These include\nsusceptibility to front-running, the prevalence of rug pulls, lack of financial\nprivacy, potential slippage on large trades, and other related challenges.\n\nHowever, order book-based platforms like BasicSwap require more liquidity to\nfill various price ranges for each pair, as this liquidity isn't being\nalgorithmically driven towards a calculated market price. A lack of sufficient\nliquidity can make the exchange less appealing, leading to larger spreads and\nfewer trading opportunities. Conversely, when there's an abundance of liquidity,\norder book-based DEXs can outperform AMM platforms by offering traders more\ncontrol over the prices at which they wish to trade.\n\nIn essence, for BasicSwap and other order book-based exchanges (including most\ncentralized exchanges), liquidity is the name of the game. It's the key factor\nthat determines the platform's effectiveness and appeal. As such, we are calling\non you to contribute to BasicSwap's growth by helping to increase its liquidity. \n\nUshering a Better World for Crypto Trading\nAs liquidity on BasicSwap increases, it will improve the appeal of each trading\npair, offering traders what they need to permanently move away from centralized\nexchanges; a shift that is essential for taking back control over their own\ncoins and financial privacy.\n\nCentralized exchanges have long maintained a firm grip over the cryptocurrency\nmarket, acting as gatekeepers and creating central points of failure. This is in\ndirect contradiction to the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies. After all,\nrecent events have clearly demonstrated the severe repercussions of\nover-reliance on such centralized systems.\n\nIncidentally, this is precisely the reason behind the creation of BasicSwap DEX.\nIts non-custodial nature, commission-free model, and privacy-first approach\nrepresent the comprehensive solution needed for the crypto ecosystem to progress\nand withstand the upcoming regulatory attack against it. \n\nBy contributing liquidity to BasicSwap, you're not just participating in the\nplatform's growth; you're becoming a part of the historical movement fighting\nfor our digital sovereignty.

Fixing these obstacles is all a part of our development roadmap, and we're actively working to address them through ongoing updates; our goal being to evolve BasicSwap into a highly user-friendly and intuitive trading platform.</p><p>However, for those eager to leverage the benefits of BasicSwap today, there are a few challenges to navigate in the meantime.</p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-run-and-store-basicswap-nodes-locally\">The Need to Run and Store BasicSwap Nodes Locally </h3><p>One of the current challenges with BasicSwap is the necessity to run the DEX locally. This can be resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU usage and storage space as it requires running full nodes — and storing blockchains — for each cryptocurrency you wish to enable and swap.</p><p>While BasicSwap works with pruned blockchains, which considerably reduce the storage footprint, the DEX still demands several gigabytes of space. And while this approach offers the highest level of security and privacy, it comes with significant resource requirements that may not be feasible for everyone.</p><p>Another consideration when running a full node is the need to keep your computer running continuously if you want your offers to remain visible on the order book and to execute swaps. This can be inconvenient for those who aim to provide liquidity reliably and continuously, and makes your setup vulnerable to power cuts and internet downtimes. </p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-manually-update-and-republish-offers\">The Need to Manually Update and Republish Offers</h3><p>With BasicSwap's current version, offers listed on the order book are time-sensitive, expiring after a maximum of 48 hours. Once an offer expires, it requires you to manually republish it so that it reappears on the order book. This process sure can be cumbersome, especially for those looking to passively provide liquidity and with hopes of earning profits from it.</p><p>Additionally, BasicSwap does not currently have a built-in feature for automatically calculating current market rates for the trading pairs you offer. This means each time you refresh your offers, you need to manually determine the market rates, another potentially time-consuming task especially when working with multiple pairs.</p><h2 id=\"automated-market-making-on-a-24-7-basicswap-cloud-instance\">Automated Market Making on a 24/7 BasicSwap Cloud Instance</h2><p>As we progress in our development roadmap, addressing these challenges and improving the user experience to make the DEX more intuitive is a top priority.</p><p>Indeed, our roadmap includes plans to enable light nodes, remote services, web gateways, and the integration of advanced market making strategies directly into the DEX, among other items.</p><p>But in the meantime, we understand the importance of providing immediate solutions to these issues. To that end, we have prepared two specific video tutorials that are designed to help you navigate through the aformentioned challenges effectively, offering practical solutions that you can implement right away. </p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first step is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs via any potential trading profits.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up.

While AMM DEXs can achieve deeper liquidity through algorithmic aggregation of all provided liquidity, they face several critical issues that BasicSwap effectively addresses. These include susceptibility to front-running, the prevalence of rug pulls, lack of financial privacy, potential slippage on large trades, and other related challenges.</p><p>However, order book-based platforms like BasicSwap require more liquidity to fill various price ranges for each pair, as this liquidity isn't being algorithmically driven towards a calculated market price. A lack of sufficient liquidity can make the exchange less appealing, leading to larger spreads and fewer trading opportunities. Conversely, when there's an abundance of liquidity, order book-based DEXs can outperform AMM platforms by offering traders more control over the prices at which they wish to trade.</p><p>In essence, for BasicSwap and other order book-based exchanges (including most centralized exchanges), liquidity is the name of the game. It's the key factor that determines the platform's effectiveness and appeal. As such, we are calling on you to contribute to BasicSwap's growth by helping to increase its liquidity. </p><h3 id=\"ushering-a-better-world-for-crypto-trading\">Ushering a Better World for Crypto Trading</h3><p>As liquidity on BasicSwap increases, it will improve the appeal of each trading pair, offering traders what they need to permanently move away from centralized exchanges; a shift that is essential for taking back control over their own coins and financial privacy.</p><p>Centralized exchanges have long maintained a firm grip over the cryptocurrency market, acting as gatekeepers and creating central points of failure. This is in direct contradiction to the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies. After all, recent events have clearly demonstrated the severe repercussions of over-reliance on such centralized systems.</p><p>Incidentally, this is precisely the reason behind the creation of BasicSwap DEX. Its non-custodial nature, commission-free model, and privacy-first approach represent the comprehensive solution needed for the crypto ecosystem to progress and withstand the upcoming regulatory attack against it. </p><p>By contributing liquidity to BasicSwap, you're not just participating in the platform's growth; you're becoming a part of the historical movement fighting for our digital sovereignty.

MoneroKon 2023 in Prague\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-talk-at-monerokon/], where our team from\nBasicSwap DEX was represented. Our developer, Kewde, gave an insightful\npresentation on the evolution, future, and historical context of atomic swaps,\nwith a particular focus on their application with Monero.\n\nThe presentation is available, in full, on our Youtube channel, and you can\nwatch it here.\n\nWhat we've Achieved Since the Presentation\nSince presenting in June 2023, we achieved significant milestones in our road\ntowards making the DEX more usable, accessible, and feature-complete.\n\nBidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nProbably the most significant achievement since has been the deployment of\nbidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n.\n\nAdaptor signature swaps were groundbreaking when they were first published\nbecause they enabled atomic swaps between two blockchains, even if only one had\nprogrammable outputs. \n\nThis development was a game-changer, particularly for Monero, as it allowed for\natomic swaps with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Particl, marking a\nsignificant leap forward in our collective goal of preserving our financial\nprivacy and sovereignty.\n\nHowever, these swaps had a limitation: they were unidirectional. This meant they\ncould only occur when the coin with programmable outputs (i.e., Bitcoin) was the\none being offered. In practical terms, that means Monero couldn't be the coin\noffered in the swap; it could only be received in exchange for another coin like\nBitcoin.\n\nThe introduction of bidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps by BasicSwap\nDEX is a pivotal contribution to this technology. By utilizing Particl's\nSecureMessaging Network (SMSG), we've developed a method that, from the user's\nperspective, enables the coin without scriptable outputs to be swapped from both\nthe offerer and bidder sides.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper understanding of this significant advancement\nin atomic swap technology, we highly recommend reading this blog post\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/] \non the subject or exploring our DEX Revolution series available here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n. Additionally, we've published a detailed article here\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] that compares standard HTLC\natomic swaps with adaptor signature-based atomic swaps, providing more insights\ninto the differences between these two atomic swap technologies.\n\nBetter User Interface\nBasicSwap’s GUI 2.0.2 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 2.0.2 user interface is now\navailable, featuring a wide range of improvements to the user experience and UI\ncodebase.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/]We've been\ncontinuously improving BasicSwap's user interface, and we're pleased to share\nthat a major UI/UX update (version 2.1) is on the horizon.\n\nFor those interested in what this update entails, we've provided a detailed\noverview in our weekly development progress update here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n. We encourage you to head over there to learn more about all the improvements\nand changes that will be part of this upcoming release. \n\nGraphical Installers\nBasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows Released (.exe)The installation wizard\n(.exe) for BasicSwap DEX is now available for Windows users.Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-installer-for-windows-released-exe/]We've\nrecently released a graphical installation wizard for Windows users (.exe) for\nthose looking for an easier approach to setting everything up. This new feature\nnot only simplifies the installation process for Windows users but has also\ndriven a series of back-end improvements.\n\nCurrently, the installation wizard is exclusive to Windows, but we're actively\nworking on extending it to MacOS and Linux users. We aim for a release on these\noperating systems shortly, stay tuned for more any news in that regard published\non Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\nWhat's on the Horizon\nWhile 2023 was focused a lot on the DEX's back-end and developing some of its\ncore features, 2024 is poised to be a pivotal year for BasicSwap as we will\nrelease some of its most significant updates in terms of usability and\naccessibility.\n\nHere are just a few main items we plan on working on. Note that this isn't a\nfully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well,\nespecially back-end improvements and new functionalities.\n\nLight Nodes / Remote Services\nThis improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place,\nit eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which\ncurrently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup\ntimes. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX,\npotentially by more than 90%.\n\nCurrently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive\nprocess and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements.\nHowever, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level\nof security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and\nremote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands,\nthey will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize\nmaximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who\nprefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking\nfor.\n\nWeb Framework\nAs an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a\nweb framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services\ndirectly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even\n\"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.\n\nHowever, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that\nhosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore,\nsimilar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based\nversion of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a\nweb-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional\noptions, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to\nattracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's\norder book which is critical to its success.\n\nThe exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and\nthe specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet\ncommit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular\nupdates on this development in our weekly progress reports here\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/].\n\nMore Coins\nWe are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in\nprivacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize\nthe importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To\nthis end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and\nits various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.\n\nAgain, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it\ndirectly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This,\nin turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and\npractical for trading purposes.\n\nSince our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on\nessential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new\ncoins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of\nnew coins and tokens to the DEX.\n\nWe're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build\nmore bridges between communities! ?\n\nTaproot Integration\nBecause Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the\nSchnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot\nupdate which will bring massive privacy benefits.\n\nWhile our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the\nblocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature\ntransaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for\nexample, Bitcoin in a BTC <> XMR swap). It's important to note that this does\nnot disclose any information about the swap to outside observers. The\ntransaction doesn't reveal itself as a swap; it appears as a standard\nmulti-signature smart contract. However, it still doesn't look like a perfectly\nregular Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe full integration of Taproot into Bitcoin and Particl pairs using adaptor\nsignature swaps will be a game changer. It will make the multi-signature\ntransaction indistinguishable from regular transactions on the blockchain of the\ncoin with programmable outputs, significantly boosting the fungibility and\nprivacy of BasicSwap-powered swaps done this way.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that even in their current state, adaptor signature swaps\nare exceptionally private. However, we always strive to improve the privacy of\nour platform in any way we can, and integrating Taproot into our swaps is simply\na logical step forward in pushing the boundaries in the realm of financial\nprivacy and digital sovereignty. \"Hide within the noise\"!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and\nfor participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution — your\ninvolvement is a valuable contribution to this movement. \n\nThank you for being a part of this journey towards a more secure, private, and\ndecentralized digital future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This new feature not only simplifies the installation process for Windows users but has also driven a series of back-end improvements.</p><p>Currently, the installation wizard is exclusive to Windows, but we're actively working on extending it to MacOS and Linux users. We aim for a release on these operating systems shortly, stay tuned for more any news in that regard published on <a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-horizon\">What's on the Horizon</h2><p>While 2023 was focused a lot on the DEX's back-end and developing some of its core features, 2024 is poised to be a pivotal year for BasicSwap as we will release some of its most significant updates in terms of usability and accessibility.</p><p>Here are just a few main items we plan on working on. Note that this isn't a fully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well, especially back-end improvements and new functionalities.</p><h3 id=\"light-nodes-remote-services\">Light Nodes / Remote Services</h3><p>This improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place, it eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which currently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup times. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX, potentially by more than 90%.</p><p>Currently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive process and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements. However, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level of security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and remote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands, they will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize maximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who prefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking for.</p><h3 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h3><p>As an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a web framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services directly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even \"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.</p><p>However, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that hosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore, similar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based version of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a web-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional options, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to attracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's order book which is critical to its success.</p><p>The exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and the specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet commit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular updates on this development in our weekly progress reports <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"more-coins\">More Coins</h3><p>We are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in privacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize the importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To this end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and its various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.</p><p>Again, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it directly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This, in turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and practical for trading purposes.</p><p>Since our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on essential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new coins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of new coins and tokens to the DEX.</p><p>We're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build more bridges between communities! ?</p><h3 id=\"taproot-integration\">Taproot Integration</h3><p>Because Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the Schnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot update which will bring massive privacy benefits.</p><p>While our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the blocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature transaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for example, Bitcoin in a BTC &lt;&gt; XMR swap). It's important to note that this does not disclose any information about the swap to outside observers. The transaction doesn't reveal itself as a swap; it appears as a standard multi-signature smart contract. However, it still doesn't look like a perfectly regular Bitcoin transaction.</p><p>The full integration of Taproot into Bitcoin and Particl pairs using adaptor signature swaps will be a game changer. It will make the multi-signature transaction indistinguishable from regular transactions on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs, significantly boosting the fungibility and privacy of BasicSwap-powered swaps done this way.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that even in their current state, adaptor signature swaps are exceptionally private. However, we always strive to improve the privacy of our platform in any way we can, and integrating Taproot into our swaps is simply a logical step forward in pushing the boundaries in the realm of financial privacy and digital sovereignty. \"Hide within the noise\"!</p><hr><p>If you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and for participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution — your involvement is a valuable contribution to this movement. </p><p>Thank you for being a part of this journey towards a more secure, private, and decentralized digital future.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

BasicSwap's installation\nwizard [https://particl.news/firo-added-to-basicswap-installer-exe/]. This\naddition makes it easy for users to set up the DEX with Firo using the\ninstaller's graphical interface.\n\nFiro Added to BasicSwap Installer (.exe)The Firo privacy coin has been added to\nBasicSwap’s installer.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/firo-added-to-basicswap-installer-exe/]But we have even more good news about Firo to share today! As mentioned in our\nrecent weekly development updates [https://particl.news/tag/progress/], we've\nbeen working on improving Firo's integration into the DEX. Today, we're thrilled\nto announce that Firo is now fully compatible with bidirectional adaptor\nsignature swaps! \n\nThis marks a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to improve and expand\nprivacy-first technologies across different chains.\n\nWhat are Bidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps?\nHTLC-Based (“Secret Hash”) Swaps vs Adaptor Signature Swaps in\nBasicSwapShedding\nsome light on the distinctions between BasicSwap’s atomic swap technologies\ncurrently available, and their respective privacy and decentralization\nimplications.Particl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]Adaptor signature atomic swaps\nare an innovative kind of atomic swap, initially conceptualized for Monero to\nfacilitate its atomic swapping with Bitcoin (read more about it here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n). This new type was necessary because Monero lacks programmable outputs, a key\nfeature needed for the kind of smart contract required to complete its part in\nthe swap process.\n\nAdaptor signature atomic swaps use what's known as \"semi-scriptless scripts.\"\nThis approach allows for a secure swap when only one party has programmable\noutputs (specifically, the other party needs to have SegWit). This breakthrough\nmade Monero <> Bitcoin atomic swaps possible, representing a major step forward\nin the development of decentralized, privacy-first financial technologies.\n\nHowever, the utility of adaptor signatures extends beyond just enabling Monero\ncompatibility. \n\nAnonymous Atomic Swaps\nOne of the key advantages of adaptor signature-based swaps is their inherent\nanonymity. To appreciate this benefit, it's crucial to understand what causes\nthe lack of privacy in standard Hashed TimeLock Contract (HTLC) based atomic\nswaps.\n\nWhy Standard Atomic Swaps are Terrible for Your Privacy\nStandard atomic swaps, while innovative, have significant privacy drawbacks. The\ncore issue arises from the use of an identical hash that is recorded on each\ninvolved blockchain, typically at very close timestamps. Although the hash\nitself doesn't directly disclose any information when singled out, it poses a\nserious privacy threat when cross-referenced against blocks from other\nblockchains. Indeed, blockchain analysis firms can easily detect this identical\nhash on two different blockchains, allowing them to infer that the owners of the\ntwo corresponding addresses have conducted a swap together.\n\nThe situation worsens when the swap involves two transparent coins, such as\nBitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC), for example. In such cases, the transaction\namounts and the addresses of the participants are fully visible on the\nblockchain, essentially revealing all useful information to passive observers.\nThis level of transparency is akin to smart-contract swaps on platforms like\nEthereum, where the specific details of every swap, including the amounts and\ninvolved parties, are openly visible to anyone.\n\nSuch visibility is a stark contrast to the privacy expectations many users have\nwhen dealing with cryptocurrencies, especially when trading outside of\ncentralized exchanges. It highlights the need for more privacy-preserving\nsolutions, especially for those who value anonymity and confidentiality in their\ntransactions. This is why adaptor signature swaps are so relevant!\n\nSwapping Anonymously Using Adaptor Signature Swaps \nAdaptor signature swaps address the privacy issue inherent in standard HTLC\natomic swaps. When conducting a swap using this newer method, there isn't a\nmatching hash recorded on both blockchains involved in the transaction. This\nmeans the swap-related data remains exclusive to the two participating parties,\neffectively shielding it from external observation.\n\nThis confidentiality ensures that neither passive nor active blockchain tracing\ntechniques can deduce that transactions on two different blockchains are\nconnected. Although one side of the swap — the programmable side, such as\nBitcoin in a BTC <> XMR swap — will still exhibit a multi-signature transaction\non its blockchain, this transaction won't contain any identifiable, traceable\ndata, or even hints that this is specifically a swap transaction. As a result,\nit becomes impossible for anyone to link this transaction to another one on a\ndifferent blockchain.\n\nCan it be Further Improved?\nIn the case of coins paired with Bitcoin and Particl, yes. As part of our\nongoing development for BasicSwap, we're looking forward to integrating Taproot\nfunctionalities into our swap processes. This integration will begin once the\nfinal component of Taproot, known as Tapscripts, is released by the Bitcoin\ndevelopment team.\n\nTaproot is set to significantly enhance transaction privacy and fungibility. It\nachieves this by aggregating multiple signatures in a transaction into a single\none, making the transaction appear typical. Currently, a multi-signature\ntransaction on Bitcoin might still be perceived as non-standard, even though it\ndoesn't reveal extra information to an outside observer. However, once Taproot\nis fully integrated into BasicSwap, such transactions will resemble any other\nregular transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThis update will be a game-changer in ensuring swaps are not just anonymous, but\nalso seamlessly blend in with the regular transaction \"noise\" on the blockchain.\nIt's a crucial step towards achieving the goal of making swaps completely\nanonymous and fungible.\n\nAutomated Market Making on BasicSwap? Yes!\nWhile BasicSwap provides advanced functionality, it is still an early piece of\nsoftware and its liquidity is nascent. \n\nThat's why we've prepared two video tutorials that will help you setup BasicSwap\non a cloud server and automatically provide liquidity to the order book via its\ncompanion automated market making script.\n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nSetting up BasicSwap on a cloud instance is extremely useful because it won't\nrequire you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage\nspace on your personal computer. \n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting\nthe costs via any potential trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThis second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script. This allows you to provide liquidity on the\norder book in a completely automated manner, ensuring that your offers are\nrepublished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\n(via API price fetching) and add a markup on top of that market rate, netting\nyou profits when people pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with a cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node a breeze once the initial setup is complete. You can simply\nlaunch your server, deploy the market making script, and earn profits on your\nprovided liquidity with very minimal manual inputs required.\n\nHow to Swap\nOf course, nothing stops you from picking offers from other swappers if you see\ngreat opportunities. In that case, the tutorial linked below will teach you how\nto go through all the steps required.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a world increasingly marked by restrictions, censorship, and centralization,\nembracing decentralized and privacy-first platforms like BasicSwap DEX and Firo\nis crucial for reclaiming our digital sovereignty. Each individual's decision to\nuse these platforms plays a significant role in advancing these technologies and\nfostering their wider adoption for the greater good.\n\nIf you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and\nfor participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution.
