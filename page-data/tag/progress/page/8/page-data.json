This week has been a busy one with two Particl Desktop releases\nand the important detailed announcement of BasicSwap, Particl's upcoming\nprivate, free, and unrestricted DEX.\n\nSo let's not wait any longer and get down to the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nDesktop Client Updates ✅\nThis week, we've released two Particl Desktop updates (3.2.1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1] and 3.2.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]). Both of these\ndesktop client updates are intended to fix bugs and improve the overall user\nimprovements with a few tweaks to the desktop client and marketplace dApp. \n\nNotably, Particl Desktop 3.2.2 fixes a particular bug that caused, in some\ncircumstances, listings and orders to not show up on some user's clients due to\nthe market service not being able to receive SMSG messages from Particl Core\nwhen offline. This is now resolved.\n\nBecause both of these clients fix a lot of issues, we strongly recommend\nupdating your desktop client as soon as you can so that you can benefit from the\nmost up-to-date Particl experience.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 ?️\nAs the two previously-mentioned Particl Desktop client updates occupied most of\nthis week's time, the work related to Particl Desktop 3.3 mentioned in last\nweek's development progress report is still ongoing.\n\n> We're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts with Particl\nDesktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when the desktop\nclient is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related updates coming\nto Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nIndeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that\nmay be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be\nable to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to\nconfigure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor\nfrom the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already\nrunning core service. — Quote from last week's progress report\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-24-06-2022/]\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAs we find ourselves in the final phase of BasicSwap's closed beta, we are\npreparing the ground for the open beta release. \n\nAs such, we've published an in-depth presentation of what BasicSwap is, what\nmakes it unique, what benefits you can draw from it, and how it's going to\nfoster a more private, free, and open financial system with no central point of\nfailure. Yes, we know this is a bold claim, but we completely own it and will\nlet BasicSwap speak for itself when it goes live. Stay tuned for more BasicSwap\nupdates coming very soon to Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]Aside from\nthis announcement, we've been running various tests and minor updates to\nBasicSwap, which will keep on going up until the release point.\n\nAs for the DEX's GUI, all of the independent modules and pages are now completed\nand we're in the final process of stitching everything together. This is the\nlast remaining part before we can start the last round of internal testing, and\nwe'll then be able to release the open beta publicly.\n\nUpdate on Marketplace Listing Fees\nBack in February, we proposed a hardfork that was accepted by stakers. This\nadded Taproot functionality into the Particl blockchain, but also fixed a bug\nwith the dynamic marketplace listing fee functionality.\n\nSince then, stakers have signaled to the network that they wanted lower SMSG\nfees, effectively massively reducing marketplace listing fees. We wanted to take\nthe opportunity, this week, to update you on what the current figures are.\n\nWhen Particl hardforked in February, the SMSG fee rate was standing at 20767.\nAfter a few months of signaling, it now stands at a mind-blowing 37!\n\nFor reference, we've polled a seller with ~300 listings on the marketplace and\nthey've stated that, in the past 30 days, they've only paid ~2.77 PART in\nlisting fees for the totality of their listings, listed every day.\n\nWithout applying any conclusion to the numbers above, we felt necessary to\nupdate the community on the current figures so that it can decide whether the\nfees should keep going down, stay as is, or be raised. As a reminder, this blog\npost [https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] explains, in\ndetail, how to signal your fee preference as a staker.\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing FeesAdjust the Particl Marketplace listing fees\nusing your staking power.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/]If anything, this\nshows that the bug fix back in February was successful and that the community\ncan now effectively and promptly adapt listing fees to any situation,\npreference, or need. This is a great news for the future of the platform and the\nnetwork's commitment to decentralized governance!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Both of these desktop client updates are intended to fix bugs and improve the overall user improvements with a few tweaks to the desktop client and marketplace dApp. </p><p>Notably, Particl Desktop 3.2.2 fixes a particular bug that caused, in some circumstances, listings and orders to not show up on some user's clients due to the market service not being able to receive SMSG messages from Particl Core when offline. This is now resolved.</p><p>Because both of these clients fix a lot of issues, we strongly recommend updating your desktop client as soon as you can so that you can benefit from the most up-to-date Particl experience.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-3-3-\">Particl Desktop 3.3 ?️</h3><p>As the two previously-mentioned Particl Desktop client updates occupied most of this week's time, the work related to Particl Desktop 3.3 mentioned in last week's development progress report is still ongoing.</p><blockquote>We're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts with Particl Desktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when the desktop client is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related updates coming to Particl Desktop 3.3.<br><br>Indeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that may be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be able to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to configure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor from the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already running core service. <strong>— Quote from l<a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-24-06-2022/\">ast week's progress report</a></strong></blockquote><h2 id=\"particl-core-and-basicswap-progress-report\">Particl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report</h2><h3 id=\"core-codebase-maintenance-\">Core Codebase Maintenance ?️</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Commits · tecnovert/particl-core</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Core integration/staging tree.

On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1.

That's how it goes! This\nweek, we've been making progress on all fronts while maintaining the Particl\nDesktop 3.2.1 testnet round that's currently ongoing and working along the\nfeedback received from the community.\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump into the nitty gritty details of this week's\ndevelopment progress!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nTestnet Status ?\nShortly after the publication of last week's progress report, we released, on\ntestnet, the latest version of Particl Desktop (3.2.1). So far, we have received\nvery few reports of issues from the community. And so, the builds seem to be\nstable on the various environments that used to be problematic, which means\nwe'll be able to release it on mainnet within the next few days. Should there be\nany issue with the \n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 ?️\nAside from taking care of the current testnet round, most of the rest of the\nweek has been spent digging into the coming changes for Particl Desktop 3.3. \n\nAt this time, we're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts\nwith Particl Desktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when\nthe desktop client is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related\nupdates coming to Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nIndeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that\nmay be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be\nable to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to\nconfigure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor\nfrom the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already\nrunning core service.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

It\nchanges the code so that outputs will be marked as \"change only\" if the script\nthey're received on is derived from the internal key chain and the containing\ntransaction spends outputs from the wallet.\n\nBefore this fix, the only criteria was that the output script was from the\ninternal key chain, meaning if a transaction was sent from another wallet to an\ninternal key (path m/1/...), the receiving wallet would treat all the outputs as\n\"change\" despite not owning any of the inputs to the transaction. And because\nchange outputs are hidden in the output of some RPC functions, the transaction\nwould not show in listtransactions or listsinceblock without a debit entry. It\nwould, however, show in filtertransactions, but without output details.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've merged minor BasicSwap DEX improvements\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master] and have been working\nthrough the process of finalizing the first version of the GUI for the open beta\nphase before we run a final internal testing round. As always, we've been making\nsteady progress and haven't encountered many obstacles, although there is\nnothing specific or that stands out to be mentioned.

And because change outputs are hidden in the output of some RPC functions, the transaction would not show in <code class=\"language-text\">listtransactions</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">listsinceblock</code> without a debit entry.

Desktop 3.2.1. This\nupdate does not introduce any new feature but rather pushes a lot of bug fixes,\nimprovements, as well as major dependencies updates.\n\nBecause the scope of the changes is relatively large, especially regarding the\ndependencies update, we highly encourage the community to test the new builds on\ntheir devices to ensure they run smoothly across all operating systems and\nenvironments. \n\nPlease refer to the end of this article for a full list of changes introduced by\nthis update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2.1-RC-001: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1-RC-001\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.2.1 Public Testnet · particl/particl-desktopParticl\nDesktop v3.2.1 Public TestnetRELEASE INFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN\nVERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.2.1testnet0.21.2.90.3.101.7.0\nUPDATES AND FIXES...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1-RC-001]To get\ntestnet coins, visit the Particl faucet [https://faucet.particl.xyz/].\n\nIf you happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\nIf you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\nnumber of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your Particl\nDesktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a seeding\nnode: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode \"165.22.203.185:51938\"\n\"add\".\n\nIf you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly on\nthe Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] page.\n\nYour wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\nmarketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered to\nbe a Beta release.\n\nThe Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\napplication can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2.

This should\n   prevent a common error where a market with an image is promoted but, due to\n   insufficient utxos available, the market itself is promoted, but the image is\n   sent and the GUI shows that an error occurred (despite the actual market\n   being  promoted but without an associated image).\n * The smsg keys for a market are now only removed from particl-core after the\n   market is successfully removed from particl-marketplace database (should\n   prevent an error with the removal of the market from the database from\n   stopping the market from receiving new listing items).\n * The Cart page > Shipping form now defaults the 'Save shipping profile'\n   checkbox to true if there are no addresses previously saved.\n * Adds the 'Add to cart' functionality for the listing item details modal that\n   is launched from the Chat Messages > Conversations tab (for Listing Item type\n   chats).\n * Removes the marketplace service's monitor functionality for now.\n\nWallet Module\n * Transaction table entries now display the confirmation count after the\n   transaction description rather than before it: this both keeps the layout\n   consistent and prevents the transaction amount from being cutoff\n   (half-hidden) when the application window is at its smallest dimensions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs stated, because of the scope of the changes introduced by this release,\nnotably related to major dependencies updates, we highly encourage the community\nto test it out extensively to ensure it runs smoothly on all platforms and\nenvironments.

You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nOn top of these usual merges, we've added a minor improvement to the display of\ncold staking information\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commit/37aba5f02c9639933b2fe03e5071921908dd6722]\n. \n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe're happy to confirm that we've nearly completed an important update to\nBasicSwap, which allows for the fast syncing of a full Bitcoin node using \nBTCPayServer's \"datadir\"\n[https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker/blob/master/contrib/FastSync/README.md] \nfile. That means BasicSwap can be configured to quickly sync the Bitcoin\nblockchain so that you can get started swapping cryptocurrencies in just a few\nminutes! Keep in mind that Monero can simply connect to a public node, so Monero\nswappers can get started super fast as well! ?\n\nAdditionally, we've also almost completed a major change to BasicSwap's behavior\nthat allows for multiple or fractional orders to be picked up to complete one\ntrade. For example, if you wish to swap XMR for a total of 0.15 BTC, but there\nisn't any order of precisely 0.15 BTC on the order book, this change allows you\nto either take a fraction of a larger order or multiple smaller orders.\n\nWhile these two major changes are nearly completed, there are a few DB-related\nchanges that still need to happen before they are fully ready, but that should\nbe completed shortly.\n\nFinally, we've been making additional back-end improvements to the BasicSwap\nprotocol and have been making steady progress to the DEX's user interface as\nwell.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

progress report has come.\nThis week has been a continuation of the previous endeavors mentioned in the\nmost recent development updates with more time spent on finalizing the details\nof Particl's upcoming major development cycle coming after Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump into the details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nAs we near the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.1, we've been finishing up with\nthe two remaining issues and running tests to ensure their integration. So far,\nwe've picked up a small issue in relation to the Electron dependency update in\nParticl Desktop, and we'll be addressing that this weekend and going into next\nweek.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAside from the usual and steady progress made to the upcoming DEX's user\ninterface, this week we've been exploring different ways to get a Bitcoin node\nsynced up rapidly.\n\nFor reference, while BasicSwap connects directly to a Monero public node, it\nrequires a full node for both Bitcoin and Particl to function. And while syncing\nthe Particl blockchain is not so tedious, syncing the whole Bitcoin chain can\ntake quite a lot of time. \n\nAnd so, to ensure the best user experience and as few adoption obstacles as\npossible, we've started looking at different options to circumvent that process.\nAt this time, we've identified one solution that would work relatively well and\nvery significantly cut the time required to get BasicSwap ready to swap Bitcoin,\nbut we'd like to test it more before we're ready to announce it.\n\nIn other BasicSwap news, we are almost ready to push a bunch of changes to the\nDEX's protocol that will allow users to pick up multiple orders from the order\nbook or fractions of orders. We are putting the final touches on this update and\nwill be pushing the code shortly!\n\nPlanning Ahead for the Upcoming Major Evolutionary Phase of Particl\nAs we've mentioned in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/], we are planning on\nbeginning with Particl's next evolutionary process right after the release of\nParticl Desktop 3.3. This process will not only introduce a new layer of\ndistributed services to the ecosystem and bring Particl up to par with the\nexpected level of accessibility from Web3 apps, but it will also improve said\nWeb3 in many ways by tackling some of its most urgent issues, as we've\nhighlighted in this Particl Story\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/].\n\nIn fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to\nmake the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers,\nvendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable\nwith established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work,\nand more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3\necosystem and community.\n\nWhile we are still spending time to finalize the details of this significant\nevolutionary phase, we are now almost ready to publicly reveal the big plans\nwe've got lined up for Particl going forward and we'll be announcing it very\nshortly on Particl News with a comprehensive and in-depth blog post. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving. None of it would be possible without you\nall!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend we'll see you all back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

\n\nWithout losing any time, let's get down to the crux of this week's update right\naway!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nAs we've mentioned in recent past updates, we've been working on updating\nParticl Desktop's dependencies to make the client up-to-date with all the latest\nversions of the packages it uses. This would, notably, fix some launch issues\nthat have been happening with some OS environments such as Manjaro or Fedora\nLinux distributions.\n\nToday, we can report that the base changes are mostly sorted out and that there\nare 2 changes left before we can officially mark this task as completed:\n\n 1. Complete the marketplace tests (ensuring that all updated dependencies work\n    as expected);\n 2. Complete the ZMQ-related changes for electron to ensure that Particl Desktop\n    works without issues on Windows.\n\nOnce those changes are done, we'll start the process of building Particl Desktop\nacross the different platforms and then test that all the expected functionality\nworks within these environments. We expect to get started on that during the\ncourse of next week. \n\nOnce everything is tested and confirmed to be ready, we'll create test builds\nfor internal testing, and if no issues are detected, then we'll end up releasing\nthis as Particl Desktop 3.2.1.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

We've made, once again, some good progress on both the DEX's user\ninterface and the ability to pick up multiple or fraction of orders from its\norder book, although that feature is not fully ready yet.\n\nListing Seeding Proposal\nWith product codes now integrated into Particl Desktop 3.2, we can now move\nahead with the marketplace listing seeding CCS proposal\n[http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nAs a reminder, this CCS proposal, headed by Arnold Bansemer and Cryptoguard,\naims at populating the marketplace with a significant number of listings and\nautomating some of the processes involved with the publishing of listings and\nprocessing of orders.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we'll have the first iteration of this proposal ready after\nwhich point we'll iterate it over and improve as we move ahead.

Indeed, you can now download and\ninstall the new desktop client and enjoy all the new features, improvements, and\nbug fixes!\n\nMarketplace Messaging System ?\nNotably, this release introduces the widely-anticipated messaging system that\nallows sellers and buyers (and potential buyers as well) to communicate with\neach other. This new functionality is available in two different ways.\n\nOn one end, each listing now has a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask\nquestions to the seller. All messages posted in a listing's chatroom are\npublicly viewable, meaning anyone can see current and past messages sent this\nway.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\nProduct Codes ?️\nProduct codes allow a seller to uniquely identify their items according to their\nown predefined system. Note that this has no impact on the buyer side as the\nproduct codes are not publicly displayed along with a listing; they simply exist\nto provide some assistance to sellers in terms of inventory management. \n\nThe introduction of product codes is necessary for future additional features\nand for the deployment of the listing seeding system as detailed in this CCS\nproposal [http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nVarious Improvements ✔️\nAside from the two new features mentioned above, Particl Desktop 3.2 introduces\na few more improvements to both the marketplace app and the wallet.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1.

A product code can only be added to a product template but\n   it is visible on the market specific templates that are derived from the same\n   product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a\n   market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify\n   specific items.\n * The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page),\n   is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should\n   now be more easily identified.\n * Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing\n   messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any\n   chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages\n   are only visible between the buyer and seller.\n\nWallet\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI and functionality of the\nwallet module, for convenience:\n\n * An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration\n   input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at\n   the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or to\n   the beginning of the value only).\n * It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmations.\n * A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\"\n   to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. \n * Wallets are now grouped according to location/function. This all should make\n   wallet selection slightly easier particularly when a number of wallets have\n   been created.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.2 and the long-anticipated messaging system now out on\nmainnet, stay tuned for a follow-up blog post that will detail what's to come\nnext with Particl Desktop 3.3. and beyond ?\n\nWe hope you enjoy this new Particl Desktop release and thank you for your\npassion and dedication to the Particl mission.

the time of our weekly\nprogress update. \n\nThis week has been a positive and interesting one with the release of the\nParticl Desktop 3.2 on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-testnet/] and we'd like to report on\nhow this testing round is going and on what else we've been working on as we\napproach the long-anticipated release of this desktop client update on mainnet.\n\nSo let's jump right into it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nParticl Desktop 3.2 Testnet is LiveThe long-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.2\nupdate is now publicly available on testnet!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-testnet/]As mentioned, earlier this\nweek, we've released Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001] to allow\nfor community-wide testing of the new client before it hits mainnet.\n\nWe can happily report that no significant issue has been found by the community\nyet in any of the new features and functionality introduced by the new update.\nHowever, we are currently investigating an OS-specific display/launch issue\nobserved in Manjaro and potentially some Fedora environments as well. The\ninvestigation is still underway and the issue is intended to be fixed for the\nmainnet launch of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nOther than testnet-related matters, we've started preparing and setting things\nup for the development cycle of Particl Desktop 3.3. This upcoming cycle will\nfocus on improving the back-end code of the desktop application, as opposed to\nadding new features to the wallet or marketplace, and will lay very important\ngroundwork for the next major phase of the Particl ecosystem. We'll communicate\nmore information about this next major phase, which aims at dramatically\nimproving Particl's potential for adoption, shortly in a blog post dedicated to\nthat topic coming soon to Particl News [particl.news].\n\nBut what we can say now, in regards to Particl Desktop 3.3, is that it will\nimprove the desktop's application level of privacy and security as well as give\nusers more control over the way they want to use the desktop client. This will\nbe reflected, for example, by better integrating the Tor network, or by adding\nmore user-defined configuration, among other similar back-end improvements. \n\nStay tuned for more information about what Particl Desktop 3.3 will bring and\nwhat the next major development phase will bring to the Particl ecosystem as a\nwhole (hint: not exclusively desktop-focused ?). \n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort in\nmaintaining Particl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. And this\nweek, this process has taken a particularly good amount of time. You can always\nkeep track of those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. \n\nNote that, in the past, we've referred you to look at Particl's \"Particl Core\"\nrepository to track core updates. But if you've had a look at it this week,\nyou've probably noticed that no code was pushed. That's because new updates are\nonly merged periodically while the bleeding edge stuff stays on a private\nrepository.\n\nIndeed, if you really want to keep track, in real-time, of the progress being\nmade on Particl Core, then the absolute best way to do it is by tracking Particl\ncore developer Tecnovert's private repository here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].

You can now download and install the new desktop client and thoroughly\ntest all the new additions and improvements.\n\nUser Messaging (Marketplace) ?\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new Particl Desktop client update introduces a new and major\nmarketplace feature: user messaging. It lets sellers and buyers (as well as\npotential buyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form.\n\nUser messaging is available in two different ways. On one end, each listing now\nhas a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to the seller. All\nmessages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable, meaning anyone\ncan see current and past messages sent this way. This function is likely to\nreplace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get your feedback\nand thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet round.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\n> Note: At this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make\nit possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use\nParticl Marketplace.\nDefault Market Behavior ?\nStarting from Particl Desktop 3.2, the Open Market is not automatically joined\nby default anymore and it is also possible to leave that market.\n\nThis new approach gives you more control over your experience and will reduce\nyour market file size should you not be interested in what's on the Open Market.\nThe Open Market remains available to join at any time within the Market Browser\nand a link to join it is clearly displayed upon first launching the marketplace\napp (for newcomers/fresh installs).\n\n> Note: If you have already used Particl Marketplace in the past, your client will\nremain connected to the Open Market unless you manually leave it. \nProduct Codes ?️\nThis update introduces product codes to help vendor better manage their products\nand integrate their inventory into their already-existing inventory management\nsystems.\n\nProduct codes are unique identifiers that can be added to listing templates.\nThey are user-defined and do not show up publicly when publishing items on the\nmarket; they are purely intended as back-end information for the seller.\n\n> Note: This feature was a prerequisite for the deployment of the listing seeding\nproposal. [http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]\nAnd many more... ?\nThere are a lot of other UI and user experience improvements coming along with\nParticl Desktop 3.2. For a full list of these changes, refer to the change log \nhere [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001] or\nat the bottom of this blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2.0-RC-001: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.2.0 Public Testnet (release 1) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopTestnet release version for the upcoming v3.2.0RELEASE\nINFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET\nVERSION 3.2.0 (RC 001)testnet0.21.2.90.3.91.7.0 ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001]To get\ntestnet coins, visit the Particl faucet [https://faucet.particl.xyz/].\n\nIf you happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nPARTICL ACADEMY\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode\n   \"165.22.203.185:51938\" \"add\".\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * The Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\n   application can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * The previous default market, the Open Market, is no longer joined by default\n   on a fresh/clean installation.\n * Navigating to the \"listings browser\" section, when no markets are joined,\n   will now indicate that a market needs to be joined (and present navigation\n   options to the \"market browser\").\n * If the Open Market market is not currently joined, the option to join this\n   market is displayed semi-permanently above the list of promoted markets\n   (making it available as an option for new users when no market is actively\n   being promoted).\n * For users updating from earlier versions in which the Open Market was joined\n   by default, the ability to remove/un-join the Open Market is now available\n   (i.e., the Open Market can be removed/un-joined just like any other market).\n * An additional filter has been added to the Batch Publish Modal to allow for\n   the filtering of items that have previously been published to a selected\n   market.\n * Product codes, or unique seller codes for items, can now be specified for\n   different items. A product code can only be added to a product template but\n   it is visible on the market-specific templates that are derived from the same\n   product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a\n   market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify\n   specific items.\n * The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page),\n   is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should\n   now be more easily identified.\n * Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing\n   messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any\n   chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages\n   are only visible between the buyer and seller.\n\nWallet\n * An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration\n   input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at\n   the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or the\n   beginning of the value only).\n * It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmation.\n * A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\"\n   to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. Wallets are now also grouped according to\n   location/function. This all should make wallet selection slightly easier\n   particularly when several wallets have been created.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n * Please only use the .dmg file to install the application for Mac OSX 10.15 or\n   greater. The .app file extracted from the zip package does not currently run\n   on OSX 10.15 (although it should work correctly on 10.14 (Mojave) or\n   earlier).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned above, we would love to get your input on the deprecation of the\n\"Reviews\" functionality in favor of the new Chat system. Feel free to test it\nout, ask questions, and leave your remarks on our chatrooms, your thoughts are\ngreatly appreciated and help us shape a better product for the benefit of all!\n\nOnce a few days of testnet have passed and barring any major issue, Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release on mainnet. We will soon communicate what\nare the plans for moving towards Particl Desktop 3.3 and beyond, so make sure to\nstay tuned!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

progress report! This\nweek, we've got some exciting news to share we're sure you'll love in regards to\nParticl Desktop 3.2, so let's not waste time and get to it right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've finally completed the integration of the new messaging system\ninto Particl Marketplace! This new feature lets sellers and buyers (or potential\nbuyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form. \n\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new update introduces user messaging in two different ways. On one end,\neach listing now has a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to\nthe seller. All messages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable,\nmeaning anyone can see current and past messages sent this way. This function is\nlikely to replace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get\nyour feedback and thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet\nround.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\nAt this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make\nit possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use\nParticl Marketplace.\n\nPrivate in-order conversation between a seller and a buyerWith the messaging\nsystem now ready for the marketplace, we are currently looking at a few minor\nissues raised within the last few days and, if there's any fix required, they'll\nbe included in Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nBarring any issue stemming from the current round of internal testing, we'll be\nready to release Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet within the next 24 to 72 hours.\nThen, if all goes well, we'll be able to release it, on mainnet, a few days\nafter that.\n\nAs always, we highly encourage you to come and help us test this new major\nParticl Desktop release to ensure that no edge case or environment-specific\nissue is missed by the team. Additionally, as we've mentioned just a bit above,\nwe're also curious about your feedback regarding the deprecation of the Reviews\nfunctionality in favor of public chatrooms within listing pages.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nNew Particl Core Version ✅\nRelease Particl Core 0.21.2.9 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129Hashes56c899c09cb11948c9b81e92ff2599fbcf8cd18b10fd3e708064d37b1b1c4bbd\nparticl-0.21.2.9-aarch64...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]Earlier this\nweek, we pre-released Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9], a release\nfocused on network stability, on Github. It includes a variety of SMSG network\nimprovements and also improves the stability of the blockchain's connectivity by\nbanning misbehaving peers more effectively. Follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129] \nfor the full list of changes.\n\nWhile this is still marked as a pre-release, meaning your cold staking nodes\nwon't update automatically through Partyman, we encourage you to install this\nnew version and report back to the team should you encounter any issues. It will\nbe marked as a full release shortly.\n\nParticl Electrum ✅\nRelease 4.2.1.5 Particl · tecnovert/electrum\nHashesdb67abb00dc575a4270c88cbd36105ae72355f7edc1c21830865fd8f9769afcb\nElectrumParticl-4.2.1.5-arm64-v8a-release.apkf8df945d44de292395cdc20452931fa12d2fd2a1fa9352a794e76be74ab8da15\nElectrumPart...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl]We've also\npushed a minor cosmetic fix\n[https://github.com/particl/electrum/commit/f1b8c13636c9ffcf6fd37a03340d4eff2d7f0354] \nto Particl Electrum mobile which changes the display of staking transactions\nfrom a negative fee to a correctly marked staking reward.\n\nTo that effect, we pushed, a few hours ago, new mobile builds (.apk) for Android\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl] that fix\nthis issue.\n\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute\nto particl/particl-core development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]As usual,\nvarious code adaptions and merges have been done as part of our ever-ongoing\nprocess of keeping Particl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You\ncan always keep track of those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nAs a reminder, while this task may appear \"mundane\" on the surface, it is vital\nfor the deployment of certain functionalities that are critical to the success\nof our ecosystem. \n\nFor example, Taproot, which is now available on Particl, is poised to become an\nimportant feature of the upcoming BasicSwap DEX. By not keeping the Particl Core\ncodebase up-to-date with the ongoing Bitcoin developments, integrating such a\nmajor feature would not only be very messy and time-consuming, but it would also\npotentially be unsafe as it would be missing important dependencies.\n\nWhat keeping up with the Bitcoin codebase allows Particl to do is to leverage\nall the new exciting updates, features, and functionalities of Bitcoin and\nintegrate them, when and if needed, into our wider ecosystem in a timely and\nsafe manner.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe do not have anything in particular to mention this week on BasicSwap other\nthan what was mentioned in last week's report. We are still working on\nfinalizing the DEX's user interface and it is the current main focus of our\ndesigner and lead UI/UX, Gerlof van Ek.\n\nExclusive Episode of the Super Dangerous Club\nYou're probably already aware of the Super Dangerous Club, the weekly show by\nParticl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe Fisher. They talk about\nvarious topics touching on technology, geo-politics, futurism, and more. \n\nLast week, they focused their episode on the Particl project and Particl\nMarketplace. If you're a fan of Particl, then this one is an episode you must\nnot skip.\n\nWhile the episode itself is not yet released anywhere other than on Clubhouse,\nwe thought of sharing it here in advance for our weekly progress update readers\nonly.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below!\n\n@superdangerous | Linktree?Meet Kap and Joe talk about anything outside ? of\npolitics, society, tech ?Linktree [https://linktr.ee/superdangerous]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

In fact, cold staking pools that were using\nmulti-signature addresses (i.e., coldstakingpool.com\n[https://coldstakingpool.com]) had been affected by a bug that prevented the\nautomated distribution of staking rewards after the release of Particl Core\n0.19.2.19. \n\nThis bug has been resolved yesterday, cold staking pools operators have been\nnotified of the fix, and rewards have already been successfully distributed to\nstakers that are staking on pools that have since then made the update. The\napplied fix has for bonus effect to make cold staking pools significantly\nfaster.

This\nweek, we've got some exciting development on the side of Particl Desktop, with\nits new version finally nearing the beginning of the testnet round of testing!\n\nLet's jump right in and get into these details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week we've seen significant progress with the upcoming messaging system\nthat will be added to the marketplace. Dare we say that it is...right around the\ncorner? ?\n\nIn fact, it is now nearing completion, with the majority of the work in Particl\nDesktop being now completed. As it stands now, there are only a couple of issues\nthat still need to be addressed and one or two additional features that still\nneed to be implemented relating to the messaging. Still, those are minor\ncompared to the work that's already been done on that end.\n\nFor example, the ability to save a label, like a name or an identifier, to a\nparticular chat address still needs to be added to the desktop client; a feature\nthat should take no time to add. \n\nIn addition, there are still a couple of non-messaging issues that we've come\nacross that need to be looked at. By fixing these, along with the\nnow-quite-impressive number of improvements and bug fixes since our last desktop\nclient update, you can guess that Particl Desktop 3.2 is going to have a much\nbetter user experience and feel much smoother, especially for vendors who've\nsubmitted a non-negligible list of feedback, comments, and suggestions! Thank\nyou all for your constant reports; they help immensely in improving Particl!\n\nWith all of the above in mind, the focus for next week will be to complete all\nof the messaging-related changes (final desktop client implementation issues and\nfinal additional features) and do the final internal testing of the entirety of\nthe messaging implementation. We'll also strive to finish off the other\nnon-messaging issues. \n\nAnd so, we hope to be able to initiate the building process for Particl Desktop\n3.2 towards the end of next week or early into the following week. Regardless of\nwhen that process starts, expect a thorough update on the matter in next week's\nprogress report!\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've rebased the PartPayServer based on a request from a\npotential new partner to use the latest version of Particl Core. That means the\npayment server is now compatible with Taproot!\n\nFor those who don't know, PartPayServer is a payment module that can be\nintegrated into any website to accept both Bitcoin and Particl payments. The\npayment module can be integrated onto almost any website or platform or be added\nto any WooCommerce shop using the BtcPayServer plugin (cross-compatible with\nPartPayServer). \n\nIf you would like to accept Bitcoin or Particl payments on your website or\nonline shop (not hosted on Particl Marketplace), we recommend getting\nPartPayServer here [https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver].\n\nGitHub - tecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor.Accept Bitcoin payments. Free,\nopen-source & self-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor. - GitHub -\ntecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin pa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver]You'll find all the required\ndocumentation on setting it up here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver/blob/master/README.md]. Additionally,\nif you want to install and run the WooCommerce plugin, refer to this document \nhere [https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/]. Although the documentation is\nmade for BtcPayServer, PartPayServer is completely cross-compatible with the\nplugin and will work without issue. Just make sure to enable the Separate\nPayment Gateways setting to accept PART and get to the api key from btcpayserver\nby going to: Account -> Manage account -> api keys. It's listed in the next\nsection after automatically setting up the api key. Finally, for this to work,\nyou'll need to set up your own store and wallets in PartPayServer.\n\nAside from this rebase, the rest of the focus has gone towards keeping the\nParticl codebase up-to-date with Particl Core, as is usual.\n\nBroadcasting Lower Market Listing Fees\nAs most of you know, the size of the Particl Marketplace listing fees is\ndependent on what the network wishes to see. Anyone who stakes PART can\nbroadcast their fee preferences and influence the rate with which the\nmarketplace bases its listing fees.\n\nSince the fee broadcasting feature was fixed and re-enabled on our last\nhardfork, the community has lowered listing fees significantly. Indeed, we've\nseen a 66.6% decrease in listing fees, going from a target fee rate of 20,767 to \n6,935 at the time of this writing. So how does that translate into real-world\ndata? Let's check it out.\n\nFor this example, let's assume a seller sells 100 items over 30 days. He\naverages three high-quality images and a reasonable description length in each\nlisting. Thus, this example assumes an SMSG message size of around 0.5 MB. In\ntotal, after a month's worth of listing with PART's value set at $0.80), the\nseller would have paid $83.22 in total. Note that because there is no sales fee\nor any other eCommerce-related fee on the platform, that is all the seller will\npay, regardless if sales are made or not. However, the fiat valuation of the\nlisting fee does change depending on the PART price.\n\nWith this data on hand, now you're in a better position to judge whether or not\nyou want to broadcast lower or higher fee target rates. If you'd like to change\nyour preferences, we invite you to read the blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] and change your\npreferences accordingly!\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing FeesAdjust the Particl Marketplace listing fees\nusing your staking power.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

We're currently nearing completion of its integration into the ordering\nprocess (buy flow), and once that is complete, we'll start on its listing-based\nintegration.\n\nAside from work being done on the new messaging system, we've received a few\nissue and bug reports from some of the vendors currently operating on the\nmarketplace. This has led to the discovery of a couple of issues in the\nmarketplace codebase, as well as the addition of additional functionalities.\n\nFor this reason, we've seen a temporary decrease in the number of listings\ncurrently published on the marketplace as some of the sellers, some of which\nhave encountered similar issues, are waiting for them to be resolved before\nrelisting. In some cases, the changes can be made locally, and so we expect some\nmore listings to come back up even before the next release of Particl Desktop\n3.2.\n\nBasicSwap and Particl Core Progress Update\nThis week has seen the long-anticipated release of Particl Electrum, the light\nwallet which lets you manage your PART wallets without having to sync the entire\nblockchain. As such, two releases have been made this week with the second one\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/] adding the ability to\ncold stake funds stored on Electrum using Partyman as well as introducing the\nability to send funds to stealth (private) PART addresses.\n\nParticl Electrum 4.2.1.4 AvailableCold stake funds held on Particl Electrum\nusing Partyman and send funds to stealth addresses.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/]But as mentioned,\nmanaging funds through the Particl Electrum client is merely scratching the\nsurface of what we intend to do with it. Indeed, its back-end codebase provides\nlight services that can be used to make distributed applications more\naccessible. In Particl's case, it becomes notably useful for future web and\nlight releases of BasicSwap and the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, large merges have been made from Bitcoin's upstream code into\nParticl Core.
