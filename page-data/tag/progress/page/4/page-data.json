we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, that we are observing a delay that is impacting the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we are working on resolving.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits ·

updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nWork on 26.x Codebase Begins ?️\nWe've also begun work on Particl Core 26.x. Based off of Bitcoin's 26.x\ncodebase, it introduces experimental support for the v2 transport protocol as\ndefined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 324 (BIP324).\n\nWhile it is uncertain yet when we will be ready to release it, you can read more \nhere\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/06/bitcoin-cores-v260-upgrade-aims-to-impede-eavesdropping-tampering/]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we experienced a bit of a slowdown in regards to BasicSwap DEX due to\na particular bug we encountered during testing of some of the components\nincluded in the upcoming GUI update (v2.1). The bug affected the readability of\nSMSG messages when the decryption of an encrypted wallet failed, resulting in\noffers not appearing as expected on the order book. We have now fully resolved\nthis issue, although it took a considerable amount of time to diagnose.\n\nIt's important to note that while this bug posed no risk to user funds or\nsecurity, it did have a significant impact on the user experience when\ntriggered. To ensure the best possible experience on BasicSwap DEX, we recommend\nupdating to the latest version. You can find instructions on how to update to\nthe latest version here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n).\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) and Installer ?️\nWe are making steady progress on testing and finalizing the next versions of the\ninstallation wizard and BasicSwap's user interface, and still need a few extra\ndays to finish everything up. \n\nNote that most of our efforts this week were concentrated on troubleshooting and\nresolving the bug mentioned above.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

While this integration is still in the testing phase and not yet\nready for a full production roll-out, it represents a major step forward and has\nbeen updated on BasicSwap's dev Github branch.\n\nOur next focus is addressing the management of change during the conversion from\nregular LTC to MWEB balances.

This feature would work similarly to how users\ncurrently handle public, blind, and anon balances for Particl.\n\nImplementing this integration for Litecoin's MWEB would provide users with the\nability to convert their balances and perform deposits and withdrawals using\nMWEB transactions. However, it's important to note that Litecoin's upcoming\nmajor MWEB update is still required for full MWEB swaps to be possible.\n\nOur research and development efforts in this area will continue in the coming\nweeks alongside other projects, and we stand at the ready for a full MWEB\nimplementation once the update goes live in a few weeks/months.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a Cloud BSX Instance ☁️\nCloud Setup and Automated Market Making for BasicSwapSetup a BasicSwap cloud\ninstance and effortlessly run automated market making 24/7Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-ultimate-cloud-basicswap-setup-and-automated-market-making/]\nTo help improve liquidity and overcome some of the challenges associated with\nrunning BasicSwap in its current form, we've published two video tutorials that\nshow you how to smoothly run the DEX on a cloud server and automate the process\nof providing liquidity on the DEX using BasicSwap's automated market making\nscript. \n\nCombining these features results in a powerful tool: a 24/7 BasicSwap cloud\ninstance that autonomously and dynamically manages your offers. This not only\nsimplifies the process of providing liquidity on the order book, but also allows\nyou to set a premium percentage above the current market price for any pair you\nprovide liquidity to; opening up the potential for earning arbitrage profits\nwith minimal manual effort required on your part.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nEarlier this week, our community encountered an issue with swapping Monero on\nWindows via instances that had been set up via the installation wizard. After\ninvestigating, we identified that the problem stemmed from a need to update the\ncoincurve dependency and worked on a new functionality that allows for updating\ndependencies directly through the installer. \n\nWe believe the update to this functionality is now complete. However, to ensure\neverything works smoothly, we plan to spend a bit more time testing the new\nversion of the installer over the weekend, with plans to release the update\nearly next week if all goes well.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nFiro-related Fix ?\nThis week, we allocated time to develop a solution that would integrate Firo\ninto BasicSwap's installation wizard. We've made satisfactory progress, so much\nthat we believe to have a working fix at the moment, but will require a few more\ndays of testing to ensure no unexpected issue arises. As the main challenge\nstemmed from compatibility issues originating more from Firo's codebase than\nBasicSwap's, resolving the problem ended up being more intricate than one might\nanticipate. This task has thus occupied a significant part of our efforts this\nweek.\n\nOnce the fix is live, Firo will be seamlessly integrated into the current\ninstaller. No update of the installer itself will be required.\n\nWeb Order Book Display ?\nWe have continuing work on the development of a web display for BasicSwap's\ncurrent order book on BasicSwapDEX.com. This feature will let you view all\navailable offers on the DEX's primary order book directly through the website,\nwithout the need to download and install the platform. This capability should\nencourage more people to set up and use the DEX, especially if they identify\nattractive arbitrage opportunities, for example.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe are busy working on a few fixes and improvements to the BasicSwap\ninstallation wizard following community testing and feedback, including the\nfixes related to the addition of Firo. These changes will be included in\nupcoming versions of the installer for the available platforms.\n\nAdditionally, we are currently running tests for MacOS and Linux versions of the\ninstaller so that users on these operating systems can also enjoy the simplicity\nbrought by the installer.\n\nNote that, because most users that had issues installing and setting up\nBasicSwap DEX were on Windows, we opted to focus on providing an installer for\nthat platform first. That being said, be reassured that we are fully committed\nto releasing versions for other platforms as well and are presently working on\nit.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've also made progress working on the user interface, picking up from where we\nleft off when we started mostly focusing on the installer. At this point, we\nfind ourselves in the wrap up phase of the 2.1 GUI update as we test the changes\nand ensure no bugs or unexpected behaviors are encountered.\n\nAs such, we do not expect new items to be added to the upcoming 2.1 release,\nother than what's already been mentioned in previous updates (see here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n), as we're satisfied with the current changelog and are eager to start working\non new, exciting development projects for both BasicSwap and Particl Marketplace\nwhich we'll announce and detail shortly on our blog.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

We anticipate their return at the\nstart of next week, at which point we'll resume full development of the pending\nitems.\n\nWeb Order Book Display ?\nWe have begun the development of a web display for BasicSwap's current order\nbook on BasicSwapDEX.com. This feature will let you view all available offers on\nthe DEX's primary order book directly through the website, without the need to\ndownload and install the platform. This capability should encourage more people\nto set up and use the DEX, especially if they identify attractive arbitrage\nopportunities, for example.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe are busy working on a few fixes and improvements to the BasicSwap\ninstallation wizard following community testing and feedback, with more feedback\nbeing collected from the community this week. These changes will be included in\nupcoming versions of the installer for the available platforms.\n\nAdditionally, we are currently running tests for MacOS and Linux versions of the\ninstaller so that users on these operating systems can also enjoy the simplicity\nbrought by the installer.\n\nNote that, because most users that had issues installing and setting up\nBasicSwap DEX were on Windows, we opted to focus on providing an installer for\nthat platform first. That being said, be reassured that we are fully committed\nto releasing versions for other platforms as well and are presently working on\nit.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've also made progress working on the user interface, picking up from where we\nleft off when we started mostly focusing on the installer. At this point, we\nfind ourselves in the wrap up phase of the 2.1 GUI update as we test the changes\nand ensure no bugs or unexpected behaviors are encountered.\n\nAs such, we do not expect new items to be added to the upcoming 2.1 release,\nother than what's already been mentioned in previous updates (see here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n), as we're satisfied with the current changelog and are eager to start working\non new, exciting development projects for both BasicSwap and Particl Marketplace\nwhich we'll announce and detail shortly on our blog.\n\nBasicSwap DEX AMA on Navcoin's Discord Server ?\nJoin the Navcoin Discord Server!Check out the Navcoin community on Discord -\nhang out with 6409 other members and enjoy free voice and text chat.Discord\n[https://discord.gg/VMAPeHNufC]An AMA session for BasicSwap DEX is currently\nhappening on the Navcoin Discord server.

Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay that is impacting\nthe the development process of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nInstallation Wizard ?\nThe installation wizard (.exe) for BasicSwap DEX is now fully complete. We have\ndistributed it to a few people to test on different Windows versions, and will\nbe ready to push it live this coming Monday!\n\nThe installer simplifies the entire BasicSwap installation and configuration\nprocess using a graphical interface, eliminating the need for terminal\ninteractions. To ensure a successful installation, please make sure to run the\ninstaller as an administrator, as it fetches certain dependencies during the\nprocess.\n\nNote that, currently, the DEX must still be launched via the terminal. However,\nclear instructions are provided on the GUI upon the completion of the\ninstallation. We will be working to include a workaround to this over the\nweekend, but if we can't make it on time for this coming Monday release, we'll\nadd it in a subsequent update.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWith the BasicSwap installer essentially ready for release, we're now shifting\nour focus back to BasicSwap's 2.1 UI and UX update, which we've mentioned a few\nprogress reports ago. \n\nAs a refresher, here is a list of items to be included in this update, with a\ncouple of others currently in progress right now:\n\nUI/UX Changes\n * The Place New Offer page has been redesigned for a cleaner look, featuring\n   options to toggle between simple and advanced modes.\n * The steps for placing a new offer have been simplified.\n * Notifications in the main menu, as well as pop-ups, have been redesigned.\n * The settings page layout has also been redesigned.\n * A new setting allows users to choose their default currency for\n   prices/graphs, such as USD, EUR, or Pound.\n * The layout of the Network Order Book page has been revamped.\n * The \"Swaps in Progress\" page has been redesigned.\n * Both the main menu and sub-menu have been redesigned, now with a better UX\n   logic.\n * Styling improvements have been made to the (SMSG) identity page.\n * The withdrawal section of the single wallet page has also received styling\n   and UX improvements.\n * Better styling for shutdown/error/ pages.\n * Styling for alerts and errors has been revamped.\n * JavaScript browser alerts have been replaced with sleek modals and pop-ups.\n * \"Spinner\" animations have been added for both confirmation and waiting\n   periods.\n * Icons have been appended to all primary buttons.\n * Prices are now displayed on the individual offer/bid pages.\n * Various other tweaks, corrections, and code clean-up have been implemented.\n\nChart and Price Display\n * A new option now lets you only display the coins activated on the Network\n   Order Book Page.\n * Preparations are underway for the introduction of two new privacy coins,\n   including their prices, icons, and graphs.\n * The script calculating the volume of each coin has been restructured, and now\n   includes also USDT as a volume measure from exchanges.\n * Added coin volume bars overlay in the main chart.\n\nAdditionally, we've made a couple of changes and improvements to BasicSwap's\nofficial website — BasicSwapDEX.com [https://basicswapdex.com] — which should go\nlive around the same time as the 2.1 UI update.\n\nBasicSwapDEX.com Website Updates\n * Added dark mode as default.\n * Various GFX/layout tweaks and fixes\n * General UX improvements.\n * Added current coins supported (GFX) + table.\n * Fetch BasicSwap-related blog news and show last 4 items on main page.\n\nAdding New Coins ?\nWe are currently in touch with the Navcoin coin team to review the integration\nof the privacy coin into BasicSwap DEX as it has given us a few challenges. As\nit stands now, the integration should work, but isn't officially supported yet\nuntil we find a more stable way to run and sync the nodes.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we are now considering postponing official support for\nit until after the implementation of light services to the DEX, like Electrum or\nBlockbook integrations for instance. \n\nThis approach will facilitate the smoother integration of not just this coin,\nbut future ones as well. Additionally, it will grant many user experience\nbenefits such as taking out the need for syncing the complete blockchains of\neach enabled coin and maintaining multiple nodes at the same time (including\nhaving to manually update core versions whenever important core updates are\npushed).\n\nIf you still want to test the Navcoin integration in its current state, first\nensure that you're running the latest version of BasicSwap DEX and that it is\nnot currently running. Enable the use of disabled coins by typing the export\nOVERRIDE_DISABLED_COINS=true command from your BasicSwap folder, and then\nproceed to run the usual commands to add new coins to the DEX, which in the case\nof NAV, would be as follows:\n\ndocker-compose stop\nexport COINDATA_PATH=/var/data/coinswaps\ndocker run --rm -t --name swap_prepare -v $COINDATA_PATH:/coindata i_swapclient basicswap-prepare --datadir=/coindata --addcoin=navcoin\n\n> Note: A snapshot of their blockchain can be downloaded here\n[https://info.navcoin.org/navcoin-core/bootstrap-your-wallet/] to speed up the\nsyncing process.\n> Note 2: You can consult the related code by checking out the Navcoin integration\ncommit here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commit/4d8d421de65d32a3ae073d9166ff02824ab513f4]\n.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

We will resume this\ntask in the coming week.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe are in the final stages of a significant UI/UX interface update for BasicSwap\nDEX, which will soon be ready for release. It combines weeks of work aimed at\nenhancing both the user experience and interface. Below is a non-exhaustive list\nof the most notable items to be included in BasicSwap's 2.1 UI update.\n\nUI/UX Changes\n * The Place New Offer page has been redesigned for a cleaner look, featuring\n   options to toggle between simple and advanced modes.\n * The steps for placing a new offer have been simplified.\n * Notifications in the main menu, as well as pop-ups, have been redesigned.\n * The settings page layout has also been redesigned.\n * A new setting allows users to choose their default currency for\n   prices/graphs, such as USD, EUR, or Pound.\n * The layout of the Network Order Book page has been revamped.\n * The \"Swaps in Progress\" page has been redesigned.\n * Both the main menu and sub-menu have been redesigned, now with a better UX\n   logic.\n * Styling improvements have been made to the (SMSG) identity page.\n * The withdrawal section of the single wallet page has also received styling\n   and UX improvements.\n * Better styling for shutdown/error/ pages.\n * Styling for alerts and errors has been revamped.\n * JavaScript browser alerts have been replaced with sleek modals and pop-ups.\n * \"Spinner\" animations have been added for both confirmation and waiting\n   periods.\n * Icons have been appended to all primary buttons.\n * Prices are now displayed on the individual offer/bid pages.\n * Various other tweaks, corrections, and code clean-up have been implemented.\n\nChart and Price Display\n * A new option now lets you only display the coins activated on the Network\n   Order Book Page.\n * Preparations are underway for the introduction of two new privacy coins,\n   including their prices, icons, and graphs.\n * The script calculating the volume of each coin has been restructured, and now\n   includes also USDT as a volume measure from exchanges.\n * Added coin volume bars overlay in the main chart.\n\nAdditionally, we've made a couple of changes and improvements to BasicSwap's\nofficial website — BasicSwapDEX.com [https://basicswapdex.com] — which should go\nlive around the same time as the 2.1 UI update.\n\nBasicSwapDEX.com Website Updates\n * Added dark mode as default.\n * Various GFX/layout tweaks and fixes\n * General UX improvements.\n * Added current coins supported (GFX) + table.\n * Fetch BasicSwap-related blog news and show last 4 items on main page.\n\nNew Particl Website ✅\nWe've also been making steady progress on the new website, as has been the case\nfor the past couple of weeks, which we now expect to have a working version in\ninternal testing soon. \n\nAs it stands today, the design and implementation is mostly complete, and we're\nin the final stages of making adjustments, addressing the last-minute GFX tweaks\nand perfecting the layout.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Notably, it allows for withdrawals of up to 30 BTC per day without the\nneed for intrusive KYC verifications.\n\nWe're optimistic that this new listing, along with the new trading tools it\nrenders accessible to the community such as Hummingbot [https://hummingbot.org/] \nfor example, will improve the trading environment and conditions for the PART\ncoin, effectively broadening its accessibility to a wider audience than ever\nbefore since the project's initial launch in 2017.\n\nUsing Hummingbot ?\nHummingbot - the open source OS for crypto algo tradersHummingbot documentation\nand websitelogoHummingbot Foundation [https://hummingbot.org/]If you've been\nlooking to trade PART or contribute liquidity to its available markets, the MEXC\nlisting is bound to be a major boon for you on that end. \n\nIndeed, a big benefit of MEXC is that it's compatible with the powerful, free,\nand open-source Hummingbot market making and automated trading tool, which means\nyou can now use it to trade PART/USDT leveraging your own custom automated\nstrategies or one from the large array of pre-made templates\n[https://hummingbot.org/strategies/].\n\nAs such, we invite you to take a look at their website, who knows, perhaps\nyou'll find something interesting that also contributes to healthy trading\nconditions for PART at the same time!\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay that is impacting\nthe the development process of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

However, we believe that starting next week should see the\nbeginning of the testing process for some of these coins as we're finally coming\nto the end of their integration process.\n\nDon't forget that, as part of their integration process, we've reworked some of\nthe components of the DEX to make it more readily compatible with a wider array\nof coins, which means we'll generally be able to integrate new coins more easily\nin the future.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe're continuing work on refining the New Offer page, along with integrating\nmore minor improvements to the user interface.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nExploring New Coin Additions ?\nThis week, we've continued the process of exploring new coins for inclusion on\nBasicSwap and started working on a few integrations.\n\nIn the process, we've encountered unique challenges that necessitated\nimprovements to the BasicSwap codebase. Inded, while the Particl blockchain can\ninterpret transactions from various coins, the reverse isn't always true for\nsome of the coins we're aiming to integrate. Given that BasicSwap was initially\ndesigned for a swift launch with the initial coin release lineup we had at that\ntime, certain assets we're considering now aren't fully compatible with specific\naspects of the existing codebase. \n\nConsequently, we've now opted to embed additional functionalities directly into\nBasicSwap to ensure broader cryptocurrency compatibility moving forward. While\nthese modifications aren't too extensive or expected to become time-consuming,\nthey have been a focal point of our work this week.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nIn addition to the minor cosmetic updates highlighted in last week's report, \nwe've begun refining the New Offer page. Our aim is to streamline the user\nexperience by tucking most advanced options into a collapsible menu and focusing\ninstead on what coins, and what amounts, users want to swap. \n\nThis approach ensures a quicker and more intuitive interface, preventing users\nfrom being overwhelmed by technical choices. However, these options remain\neasily accessible for advanced users who seek them.\n\nPrepare Your Nodes, Voting Starts Tuesday ?️ \nTeam Funding Proposal #4Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fourth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-4/]Last week, we have published a\nfourth funding request to ensure the continued growth of the Particl project and\nto support the wide-ranging operations of the team.\n\nWe can now announce that voting will start next Tuesday and last from block \n1,493,000 to block 1,498,039, for a total of 5,040 blocks.\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it will require\na participation rate of 20% or more of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\n> Note: The accompanying CCS page of the proposal should be up in the next couple\nof hours, after which we'll publish a standalone blog post announcing the voting\nparameters and instructions on Particl News.\nHow to Vote ℹ️\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_governance.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n * For the CCS voting page of this proposal, head over here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-4.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.
