The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to\nbuild trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly\nprivate?\n\nOne of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with\nwhom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than\nthey ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get\nour data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have\nspecifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable\npractices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make\nmoney out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the\nvery people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit\nthe servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to\nanother company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard\nto keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for\nwhat purpose.\n\nWhy Does It Even Matter?\n“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically\ncommodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users\nfrom whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified\nabout it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for\nfree while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads? Nothing is\nfree on the internet, companies exist for the sole purpose of making profits and\nhuge websites have huge maintenance costs. When a platform appears as free, it\nis most likely because you are making “personal data payments”.\n\n * “Data is the new oil” — Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC\n   Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of Move Fast and Break Things: How\n   Google, Facebook, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\n\nOn one hand, this “data economy” is good for partner companies that can then\nmake their products and platforms arguably better for their users. The ability\nfor them to know who exactly is using their platform allows them to make a much\nmore customized and personal experience. But on the other hand, things can get\nugly quickly.\n\nMaking money off your back\nThe most common and recurring concern from the public when it comes to personal\ndata sharing is the fact that companies are making millions if not billions\nreselling every single detail of our private lives to whoever is willing to pay\nfor it. Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken\nfrom, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where\nit is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly\nkept in the dark even though it affects them directly.\n\nNo consent\nAs it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what\nhappens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares\nit with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their\npersonal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly\naffect anybody is with the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal. In that particular\nscenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data\nanalytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the\nRepublican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words,\nevery Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their\npolitical rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so\nunwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has\ngone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude\nreality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you,\nwith or without your consent or knowledge.\n\nIn the wrong hands\nWhen you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only\ntrust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it\nsecure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very\nvaluable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the\nexponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal\ndata as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit\ncard numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals\nconstantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of\nthumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from\nits users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that\nyou are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain\ncontinuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being\nbreached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other\ncompanies.\n\nKeeping your private life private\nOne of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact\nthat privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice\nto keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like\nit. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality\nservice without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.\n\n> “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing\nto hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you\nhave nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden\nThe GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?\nA couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when\nthe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into\neffect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses\nthe sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give\ncontrol to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified\nand stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies\nclearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they\nwill do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as\nto how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it\nsecure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the\nprotection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.\n\nDo we really have a choice?\nIn the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the\nnew terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new\nterms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In\nsome cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative\nservices that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an\nundertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users\ncould lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even\ncontact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to\naccept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece\nof software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are\nnow owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or\nApple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their\nwide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a\nrather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior\nuser-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people\nwill accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information\nto the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.\n\nYou still need to trust them!\nSecondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or\nincompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should\nthey misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will\nnever happen, as was evidenced by the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal in which Facebook\nseemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal\ndata. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get\nhacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their\nterms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data\ntheft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of\nregulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases,\nsucceed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.\n\nThe Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers\nIn the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an\nopportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only\nvery recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new\ntechnologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous\nsection, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the\ncompany behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your\npersonal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the\nneed to trust a third-party? There actually is!\n\nBlockchain technology allows two or more users to directly exchange data without\nthe use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular\nuse-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as\nBitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached\nto it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone\nin the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a\npayment processor or a company.\n\nHowever, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual\ncurrencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be\nused to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called\ndecentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with\neach other without any third-party or company running the software. It is\npossible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could\nbuy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company\nlike Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but\ntaken a step further.\n\nIs Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?\nYes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the\nworld in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some\ndrawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are \npublic and permanent data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever\nbe publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain\ntechnology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is\nnot. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while\ntransactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to\ncryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user\nidentities can be revealed.\n\nThe case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being\nstored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain\nanalysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and\ngovernmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on\ntracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s\nDepartment of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense\n(military) contractor, in as early as 2016\n(https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/).\nThis, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly\nvisible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public\ntransactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or\npresent analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really\nwant our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone\ninterested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become\npowerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain\nsomeone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech\ngiant like Amazon.\n\nTaking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level\nThe blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly\nshare data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in\nterms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and\nmade private-by-design, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved\nif combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?\n\nPrivacy-focused blockchains are good…\nThe first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers\nuntraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data\ntransactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and\ngroundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where\ntransactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts,\nparticipants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and\nzero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles.\nNote that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency\ntransactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.\n\nPrivate-by-design blockchains are even better!\nTo be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be\nmandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an\nopt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having\nopt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made,\nthus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more\nsuspect.\n\nNot everything needs to be stored on-chain\nBlockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s\nnot ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound\nfiles, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in\nthere permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the\nentire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage\nboth a scaling and security nightmare.\n\nIt is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that\nuse the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their\naccompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that\nthese P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not\nentirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of\na decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized\nstorage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It\ncould then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and\nbe configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after\npre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the\n“amnesic” properties.\n\nIt’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!\nAnother security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to\nprotecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact,\nmost blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed\nconnection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers,\nmaking it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection\ninformation.\n\nAgain, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing\nbecomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a\nsmall portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking\nsuspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re\nstronger”!\n\nThe Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality\nWith the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable\noption, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application\nplatform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy\nparameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves\nquite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any\ncurrency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS,\nBlockstack, etc).\n\nThe project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design\ndecentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services,\nand is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized\napplications very user-friendly. The project is built on the foundation of\nprivacy and security, and as such is having its breakthrough privacy protocol\n(RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase) reviewed for any flaw by the NJIT Department of\nTechnology.\n\nParticl aims at decentralizing popular web services as well as the\ncryptocurrency ecosystem and making them private-by-default, heralding a new,\nsecure, private and trust-less way for people to use the internet while keeping\ntheir private life provably private.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Case-for-Privacy-in-the-Tech-Industry/1-kjhAZ5nvH9SnqAZGsTCyrQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data.

Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken from, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where it is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly kept in the dark even though it affects them directly.</p><h3 id=\"no-consent\"><strong>No consent</strong></h3><p>As it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what happens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares it with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their personal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly affect anybody is with the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal. In that particular scenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data analytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the Republican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words, every Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their political rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so unwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has gone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude reality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you, with or without your consent or knowledge.</p><h3 id=\"in-the-wrong-hands\"><strong>In the wrong hands</strong></h3><p>When you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only trust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it secure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very valuable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the exponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal data as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit card numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals constantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of thumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from its users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that you are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain continuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being breached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other companies.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-your-private-life-private\"><strong>Keeping your private life private</strong></h3><p>One of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact that privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice to keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like it. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality service without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.</p><blockquote>“Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-gdpr-a-step-in-the-good-direction-but-is-it-enough\">The GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?</h2><p>A couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into effect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses the sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified and stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies clearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they will do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as to how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it secure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the protection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-really-have-a-choice\"><strong>Do we really have a choice?</strong></h3><p>In the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the new terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new terms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In some cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative services that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an undertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users could lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even contact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to accept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece of software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are now owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their wide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a rather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior user-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people will accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information to the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.</p><h3 id=\"you-still-need-to-trust-them-\"><strong>You still need to trust them!</strong></h3><p>Secondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or incompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should they misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will never happen, as was evidenced by the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal in which Facebook seemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal data. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get hacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their terms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data theft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of regulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases, succeed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.</p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-do-away-with-trusting-strangers\">The Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers</h3><p>In the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an opportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only very recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new technologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous section, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the company behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your personal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the need to trust a third-party? There actually is!</p><p><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> allows two or more users to directly exchange data without the use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular use-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached to it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone in the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a payment processor or a company.</p><p>However, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual currencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be used to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called decentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with each other without any third-party or company running the software. It is possible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could buy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company like Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but taken a step further.</p><h2 id=\"is-blockchain-technology-really-better-at-keeping-your-private-data-private\">Is Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?</h2><p>Yes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the world in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some drawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are <strong>public</strong> and <strong>permanent</strong> data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever be publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain technology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is not. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while transactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to cryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user identities can be revealed.</p><p>The case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being stored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain analysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and governmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on tracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s Department of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense (military) contractor, in as early as 2016 (https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/). This, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly visible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public transactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or present analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really want our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone interested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become powerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain someone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech giant like Amazon.</p><h2 id=\"taking-blockchain-technologies-to-the-next-level\">Taking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level</h2><p>The blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly share data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in terms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and made <strong>private-by-design</strong>, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved if combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?</p><h3 id=\"privacy-focused-blockchains-are-good-\"><strong>Privacy-focused blockchains are good…</strong></h3><p>The first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers untraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data transactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and groundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where transactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts, participants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and zero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles. Note that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency transactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"private-by-design-blockchains-are-even-better-\"><strong>Private-by-design blockchains are even better!</strong></h3><p>To be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be mandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an opt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having opt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made, thus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more suspect.</p><h3 id=\"not-everything-needs-to-be-stored-on-chain\"><strong>Not everything needs to be stored on-chain</strong></h3><p>Blockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s not ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound files, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in there permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the entire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage both a scaling and security nightmare.</p><p>It is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that use the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their accompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that these P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not entirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of a decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized storage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It could then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and be configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after pre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the “amnesic” properties.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-not-only-about-transactions-and-uploaded-data-\"><strong>It’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!</strong></h3><p>Another security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to protecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact, most blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed connection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers, making it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection information.</p><p>Again, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing becomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a small portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking suspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re stronger”!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-project-is-making-that-vision-a-reality\">The Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality</h2><p>With the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable option, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application platform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy parameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves quite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any currency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS, Blockstack, etc).</p><p>The project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design decentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services, and is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized applications very user-friendly. The project is built on the foundation of privacy and security, and as such is having its breakthrough privacy protocol (RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase) reviewed for any flaw by the NJIT Department of Technology.</p><p>Particl aims at decentralizing popular web services as well as the cryptocurrency ecosystem and making them private-by-default, heralding a new, secure, private and trust-less way for people to use the internet while keeping their private life provably private.\n\n</p>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"8b8f1175-b758-44c7-93aa-fefa66c3b097","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f76820","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Case-for-Privacy-in-the-Tech-Industry/1-kjhAZ5nvH9SnqAZGsTCyrQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data.

The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to build trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly private?</p><p>One of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with whom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than they ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get our data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have specifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable practices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make money out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the very people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit the servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to another company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard to keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for what purpose.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-it-even-matter\">Why Does It Even Matter?</h2><p>“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically commodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users from whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified about it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for free while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads?

This\nhas given Tecnovert, Core Developer, enough time to work on a little surprise\nwhich has been a very popular request from the community for a long time.\n\nThis surprise can now be revealed! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swaps Live on Mainnet\nOn the 15th of September 2020, the first ever Monero to Particl atomic swap was\nsuccessfully completed on mainnet.\n\n * Particl's xmrswap repository: https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/\n * Transaction: \n   https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30\n\nMonero — Particl Atomic Swap | Particl Insight\n[https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30]\nParticl Insight.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop. Here’s one!\n\nTake note that this mock up is purely a work-in-progress and would most\ndefinitely look a bit different when it’ll be ready for release. It does,\nhowever, gives a good visual representation of how it may look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis news announcement is only part of some more major announcements coming\nsoon. Yes, it’s been a long road to the launch of V3, but it’s given the time\nfor the Particl team to prepare very exciting stuff for the “after-V3” era.\n\nStay tuned, the best is yet to come!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Monero-and-Particl-Atomic-Swaps/1-lx6zvR-f6pN7G9RmKx9otw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"swap-part-and-xmr-on-mainnet-without-any-3rd-party-\">Swap PART and XMR on Mainnet Without Any 3rd Party ?</h3><p>As we head towards the long-awaited <a href=\"https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813\"><strong>Particl V3 release</strong></a>, the Particl developers have been wrapping up the last few pieces required for its launch.</p><p>Particl V3 is Particl’s biggest update to date and it introduces a brand new desktop application as well as greatly improved marketplace experience.
