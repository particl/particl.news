Despite the Christmas and New Year's holiday season, our team has been\nable to make decent strides in all aspects of the project. \n\nLet us review the progress we have made this week.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nParticl Desktop 3.3 Now Live on TestnetParticl Desktop 3.3 is now live on\ntestnet for community testing!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-now-live-on-testnet/]The\nlong-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.3 is now officially live on testnet as of\nthis past Sunday! \n\nWhile it mostly introduces back-end improvements, along with a few front-end\nchanges to accommodate for them, this update is necessary to lay the groundwork\nfor Particl's new development cycle, which is focused on making the project more\nmodular, open, and contributor-friendly.\n\nAs to provide more context to the above statement, the community recently posed\na question to Arnold Bansemer, Particl Desktop developer, inquiring as to\nwhether the team is considering the development of web or mobile versions of the\nmarketplace.

This bug fixes a faulty behavior in which \"filtering by addresses\" wouldn't\nwork (would return nothing). This functionality is used by BasicSwap to allow\nyou to filter offers by the offerer. \n\nBasicSwap ?\nMore Private Swaps ?\nWe've added a new option that lets you select a more private atomic swap\nprotocol (adaptor signature swaps) for a variety of coins on BasicSwap. This\nadditional swap protocol, which uses scriptless scripts, is the same\nprivacy-first protocol that powers Monero and Particl Anon atomic swaps. It is\nnow also available for all coins that have integrated Segwit into their core.\nHere is the list of coins that fully support this privacy-first swap protocol:\n\n * Bitcoin\n * Litecoin\n * Dash\n * Particl, Particl CT, and Particl Anon\n * Monero (of course)\n\nThis new option is not yet available in the GUI but is ready at the protocol\nlevel. We expect it to be included in the GUI shortly into 2023 when we push its\nnext major update. \n\n> Note: While it is possible to swap Firo and PIVX using this more private\nprotocol, it is mandatory for the \"from\" coin to have Segwit enabled. \n\nIn other words, you cannot list a Firo or PIVX offer requesting another coin\nusing this improved protocol. To list a Firo or PIVX offer, you need to use the\nregular atomic swap protocol (Decred-style). \n\nYou can, however, use the more private swaps using Firo or PIVX by instead\npicking up an offer requesting these coins and swap using the more private\nprotocol if it is the swap type selected by the offerer (i.e., an offer offering\nBitcoin and requesting Firo). \nUser Interface ?️\nOn the side of the user interface of BasicSwap, we're still working on the items\nenumerated in last week's update with good progress being made on all fronts.\nThese items are as follows:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler. \n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
