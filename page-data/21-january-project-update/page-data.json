Although there isn’t a ton of new stuff to report,\npartly due to a well-deserved break the developers took during the holidays,\ngood progress has been made on several fronts.\n\nLet’s get down to the details of it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Particl Core Releases\nAs mentioned recently, Particl Core developer Tecnovert has been ramping up\ndevelopment in various areas, notably in keeping Particl Core up-to-date with\nBitcoin’s codebase. As we walk through 2021, you can expect core elements and\nupdates to be more frequent than they have been in the past year or so.\n\nTo that end, two new core releases were published as pre-releases this month;\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3 and Particl Core 0.21.0.1.\n\nToday, on the 28th of January, 2021, Particl Core 0.19.2.3 has been fully\nreleased [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3] and\nhas exited its pre-release phase.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n\nThe new Particl Core 0.19.2.3 full release is mostly composed of minor bug fixes\nand improvements. It also re-introduces 32bit builds for Windows, which has now\nbeen abandoned by Bitcoin, making Particl accessible to an even wider range of\nusers across the globe. This lets users with less powerful or more dated\ncomputers access Particl Core and Particl Marketplace in less technically\nequipped environments. The full changelog is as follows:\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.2 backports.\n * New PoW checkpoints.\n * Fix smsginbox hex encoding bug.\n * Tighten IsStandard() check to fail on trailing script.\n * Re-enable win32 gitian build.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n\nThe Particl Core 0.21.0.1 is a much bigger release compared to the 0.19.2.3 one.\nIt’s the first significant core update since the 4th of December, 2019, and it\nincludes a vast number of improvements derived from Bitcoin Core 0.20 and 0.21.\nHere are some of the most noteworthy.\n\n * New RPC call to easily create and share a secure blockchain snapshot that\n   allows you to start using the blockchain while it hasn’t fully synced yet.\n * Asmap functionality\n   [https://cryptooof.com/bitcoin-core-brings-asmap-as-an-antidote-to-erebus-attack/] \n   for more reliable and decentralized network connectivity.\n * Tor V3 support\n   [https://decrypt.co/44640/bitcoins-next-upgrade-will-support-tor-v3-addresses] \n   for better network privacy. Tor will deprecate V2 addresses in the next year\n   or two, making this a critical update to Particl Core.\n * Schnorr signatures\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496] \n   and Taproot\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin] \n   readiness for more privacy and scalability. This has yet to be activated,\n   however, but Particl Core is now ready for it.\n * No default wallet created when launching Particl Core for the first time.\n * “Compact client-side block filtering” for more privacy-friendly light\n   wallets.\n * Various issue and bug fixes as well as general improvements that operate more\n   in the background\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1 is published as a pre-release, meaning it still requires a\nmore extensive period of testing across different environments before being\ndeployed as a full release. As has been the tradition with Particl, this is to\nensure the stability and security of this new release. Once it gets fully\nreleased, Particl Core 0.21.0.1 will then supercede Particl Core 0.19.2.3.\n\nIf you find any issue with Particl Core 0.21.0.1, please report them directly to \nParticl’s particl-core Github issue page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues].\n\nParticl V3\nParticl V3, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and the improved\nmarketplace codebase, has progressed well. Here are the current two areas that\nare still being worked on.\n\n * Fixing minor bugs and issues identified by the community during the testing\n   round for the first testnet build.\n * Fixing a more extensive problem related to Windows builds prevents some users\n   from launching the application normally.\n\nAlthough the minor bugs and issues are expected to be fixed quickly, the Windows\nissue is a more complicated one, requiring much more effort. A new testnet build\nof Particl V3 will likely be released very shortly, but it may not yet include\nthe fix for the Windows issue.\n\nThis would give the opportunity to the community to, once again, test out the\nbuild and make sure no new issue has appeared as a result of the various fixes\nthat are being implemented. And then, once the Windows issue is fixed, a new\ntestnet build will be immediately published. If no new problem arises after this\npoint, Particl V3 will then be ready to immediately initiate its move towards\nmainnet.\n\nParticl Academy\nThe Particl Academy is nearing completion and is still scheduled for release\nbefore the Particl V3 mainnet. Take note that, following Particl’s ethos, the\nentire Particl Academy platform will be open-sourced on Github. That’ll allow\nanyone in the community to contribute with content, propose changes, or improve\nany aspect.\n\nCCS System\nThere are two important topics worth mentioning regarding the CCS proposal\nsystem.\n\nFirst off, a major proposal was pushed roughly one month ago and has raised\napproximately 65% of its target with 29 participants contributing! It suggests\nseeding the marketplace with thousands of real items that will be able to be\nanonymously purchased. The entire buying process for these items will be\nautomated, meaning a swift and smooth user experience.\n\nTo support this initiative, please feel free to donate to the proposal by\nfollowing this link\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nSeeding Items to the MarketplaceLudx and Cryptoguard\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]Secondly,\nthe Particl team has started preparing, code-wise and logistically, to integrate\nthe new on-chain voting module into the CCS system. This will let community\nmembers push proposals that may require a consensus to be reached. Such\nproposals can include protocol changes, Community Fund movement, etc.\n\nMore details will be provided shortly about the consensus requirements (what is\nneeded for a proposal to be deemed as “having reached consensus”) as well as the\non-chain voting system in general and its expected time of arrival.\n\nParticl.News Translations\nA while ago, valuable Particl community members started translating key blog\nposts. However, due to the limitative nature of Medium, they couldn’t be\nproperly displayed on Particl.News. This has now changed with Particl’s blog\nmigration from Medium to Ghost.\n\nTranslated articles are now being published on Particl News\n[https://particl.news]! These translated articles do not show up, by default, on\nthe blog’s main page but can be easily accessed by clicking the right language\nflag at the top right corner of the screen.\n\nAs translations are a big part of making Particl accessible to the global\ncommunity, we’d like to thank all these contributors for their hard work in\ntranslating these articles. They are WhiteFlag (Spanish), Laurogripa \n(Portuguese), Mbacoinin and Stock999 (Russian), and Anonymouser (Philippines)!\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Particl and help out translating content into\nyour native language, please reach out on Particl’s Discord server or Telegram\nchannels. We’ll be happy to see with you what content is the most important to\ntranslate and publish your work on Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Needs YOU!\nAs we now find ourselves on the verge of going live with the second testing\nround of Particl v3, Particl needs your help! So get your machines ready so that\nwe can all blast through this new testing round ensuring a fast, but secure,\nmigration towards mainnet. \n\nIn the meantime, you can be of crucial help by testing out the new Particl Core\n0.21.0.1 release. Testing it across many different environments (operating\nsystems, hardware setups, etc) helps picking up potential issues more\neffectively and moving forward more effectively.\n\nAs always, the entire Particl team would like to warmly thank you for your\ncontinued support through the years so far. Let's, together, make 2021 a great\nyear for Particl and the world of decentralized e-commerce in general!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

As has been the tradition with Particl, this is to ensure the stability and security of this new release. Once it gets fully released, Particl Core 0.21.0.1 will then supercede Particl Core 0.19.2.3.</p><p>If you find any issue with Particl Core 0.21.0.1, please report them directly to <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\"><strong>Particl’s particl-core Github issue page</strong></a>.</p><h1 id=\"particl-v3\">Particl V3</h1><p>Particl V3, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and the improved marketplace codebase, has progressed well. Here are the current two areas that are still being worked on.</p><ul><li><strong>Fixing minor bugs and issues</strong> identified by the community during the testing round for the first testnet build.</li><li><strong>Fixing a more extensive problem related to Windows builds</strong> prevents some users from launching the application normally.</li></ul><p>Although the minor bugs and issues are expected to be fixed quickly, the Windows issue is a more complicated one, requiring much more effort. <strong>A new testnet build of Particl V3 will likely be released very shortly, but it may not yet include the fix for the Windows issue.</strong></p><p>This would give the opportunity to the community to, once again, test out the build and make sure no new issue has appeared as a result of the various fixes that are being implemented. And then, once the Windows issue is fixed, a new testnet build will be immediately published. <strong>If no new problem arises after this point, Particl V3 will then be ready to immediately initiate its move towards mainnet.</strong></p><h1 id=\"particl-academy\">Particl Academy</h1><p><strong>The Particl Academy is nearing completion</strong> and is still scheduled for release before the Particl V3 mainnet. Take note that, following Particl’s ethos, the entire Particl Academy platform will be open-sourced on Github. That’ll allow anyone in the community to contribute with content, propose changes, or improve any aspect.</p><h1 id=\"ccs-system\">CCS System</h1><p>There are two important topics worth mentioning regarding the CCS proposal system.</p><p>First off, <strong>a major proposal was pushed roughly one month ago and has raised approximately 65% of its target with 29 participants contributing</strong>! It suggests seeding the marketplace with thousands of real items that will be able to be anonymously purchased. The entire buying process for these items will be automated, meaning a swift and smooth user experience.</p><p>To support this initiative, please feel free to donate to the proposal by following <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html\"><strong>this link</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Seeding Items to the Marketplace</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://ccs.particl.io/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Ludx and Cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://ccs.particl.io/img/particl-ccs-logo.svg\"></div></a></figure><p>Secondly, the Particl team has started preparing, code-wise and logistically, to <strong>integrate the new on-chain voting module into the CCS system</strong>. This will let community members push proposals that may require a consensus to be reached. Such proposals can include protocol changes, Community Fund movement, etc.</p><p>More details will be provided shortly about the consensus requirements (what is needed for a proposal to be deemed as “having reached consensus”) as well as the on-chain voting system in general and its expected time of arrival.</p><h1 id=\"particl-news-translations\">Particl.News Translations</h1><p>A while ago, valuable Particl community members started translating key blog posts. However, due to the limitative nature of Medium, they couldn’t be properly displayed on Particl.News. This has now changed with Particl’s blog migration from Medium to Ghost.</p><p><strong>Translated articles are now being published on </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\"><strong>Particl News</strong></a>!

Estos artículos brindarán una buena\nbase de conocimientos sobre las características más técnicas de la plataforma y\npueden servir de guía, en un futuro, para los nuevos miembros de la comunidad o\nlos usuarios de la plataforma.\n\nLa plataforma Particl utiliza una criptomoneda centrada en la privacidad con\ndiferentes niveles de anonimato, llamada PART. Cuando se utilizan monedas PART\npara transacciones financieras, los usuarios pueden elegir entre 3 tipos de\ntransacciones (públicas, ciegas, anónimas). Cada uno de estos tipos de\ntransacciones conlleva su propio nivel de privacidad, así como su propio\nconjunto de propiedades.\n\nEn este artículo se describirán cada uno de estos tipos de transacciones\ndetalladamente, explicando por qué y cuándo se deben usar. Después de leer esto,\nlas transacciones en la plataforma Particl ya no deberían ser un secreto para\nusted.\n\nTabla de contenidos\n\n * Transacciones públicas (Public)\n * Transacciones a ciegas — Blind (CT)\n * Pruebas de rango\n * Bulletproofs (Antibalas)\n * Transacciones anónimas (RingCT)\n * Firmas de anillo (MLSAG)\n * Cómo hacer transacciones anónimas en el Particl Desktop\n * Manteniendo un buen nivel de privacidad\n * Direcciones ocultas\n * CT + RingCT juntos = Posibilidades infinitas.\n\nTransacciones públicas\n * Protocolo: Bitcoin\n * Nivel de privacidad: Bajo.\n * Costo de transacción: Bajo (0.000346 PART).\n * Segwit: Sí (reduce el peso de las transacciones en un 20%).\n * Configuración confiable: no.\n * Salidas programables: Sí\n\nTransacciones públicas en la blockchain de Particl(Fee: 0.000346 PART)Cuando no\nse selecciona ningún protocolo de privacidad para ofuscar sus transacciones en\nla cadena de bloques, las transacciones se envían como \"transacciones públicas\".\nDebido a que la plataforma Particl ha construido su cadena de bloques basada en\nel código base de Bitcoin, las transacciones públicas se registran en la cadena\nde bloques de la misma manera que esperaría que se registren las transacciones\nde Bitcoin.\n\n>  El nucleo de Particl está siempre actualizado con las versiones del núcleo de\nBitcoin, lo que significa que todas las correcciones, parches de seguridad y\nactualizaciones para el núcleo de Bitcoin también se integran en el núcleo de\nParticl.\nAl contrario de lo que mucha gente afirma, Bitcoin no es anónimo. De hecho, es\ntodo lo contrario. Las transacciones de Bitcoin (y las transacciones de Particl,\npor proxy) son lo que llamamos transacciones seudónimas y son bastante\ntransparentes. En lugar de que cada transacción esté vinculada a una persona,\nestá vinculada a un seudónimo alfanumérico compuesto por números y caracteres\nvariados y diferentes.\n\nSi bien esto, probablemente, sea suficiente para proteger tus datos personales\nde otros, el sólido análisis protocolar que realiza la blockchain hace que sea\ndemasiado fácil para cualquier curioso, lo que motiva a terceros a ahondar en la\nblockchain, rastreando así a los usuarios. Este rastreo se vuelve sumamente\nfácil, en el momento en que se realiza un pago a cualquier servicio que\nnecesariamente vincula las direcciones con las identidades (exchanges,\nprocesadores de pagos, proveedores, etc.).\n\nPor esta razón, el equipo de Particl ha implementado dos diferentes protocolos\nde privacidad, que logran ocultar las transacciones en las blockchains. Ambos\nprotocolos no requieren de ninguna configuración confiable y tienen\ndenominadores comunes, pero también tienen diferentes propósitos dentro de la\nplataforma Particl, así como diferentes niveles de privacidad.\n\nTransacciones a ciegas — Blind (CT)\nTransacciones confidenciales\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\nElementos: una blockchain  de código abierto con capacidad para cadenas\nlaterales. [https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\nelementsproject.org\n[/p/57832095-bcbd-4135-a3a5-aadf55f99fe8/elementsproject.org]\n\n\n * Protocolo: Transacciones confidenciales (CT)\n * Nivel de privacidad: Medio (los montos de las transacción están ocultos).\n * Costo por transacción: Medio (~ 0.001962 PART).\n * Segwit: Sí (reduce el peso de las transacciones de CT en un 48%).\n * Bulletproofs (prueba antibalas): sí (reduce el tamaño de las pruebas de rango\n   en un 70%).\n * Configuración confiable: No.\n * Salidas programables: Sí.\n * Whitepaper: \n   https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n   [https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation]\n\nUna transacción a ciegas en la blockchain de Particl (Fee: 0.001962 PART)Las\ntransacciones a ciegas son transacciones de divisas que tienen sus montos de\ntransacción ocultos en la cadena de bloques y solo las dos partes que realizan\nla transacción(el remitente y el receptor) las conocen. Este tipo de transacción\nutiliza el protocolo de privacidad de transaccionesconfidenciales(CT)\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation] .\n\nEnviando una transacción cegada(CT)en Particl DesktopEste protocolo de\nprivacidad no requiere ninguna \" configuración confiable\n[https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/] \" o asistencia de ningún\nintermediario para procesar transacciones ni requiere la interacción directa\nentre las partes que realizan la transacción.\n\n> Las \" configuraciones confiables [https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/] \"\nrequieren una configuración única que implica la generación y uso de claves\nmaestras. Los usuarios deben confiar en quien haya generado esas claves para\ndestruirlas justo después de que hayan terminado de configurar el protocolo; de\nlo contrario, esas claves podrían usarse para crear una cantidad ilimitada de\nmonedas y hacerlo sin que nadie se dé cuenta.\n\nLas transacciones a ciegas utilizan un método de prueba de conocimiento nulo\npara garantizar criptográficamente que no se pueden gastar más monedas de las\nque están disponibles. Particularmente se usa lo que llamamos una prueba de\nrango, la cual garantiza que la cantidad de monedas enviadas en una transacción\ndeterminada esté entre dos valores.\n\nPrueba de rango\n\nUna prueba de rango es un protocolo criptográfico que se utiliza para verificar\nque el monto de un pago sea positivo o cero, sin revelar realmente el monto\ntransferido en la transacción . Sin pruebas de rango, los montos en una\ntransacción podrían establecerse tan grandes que se consideraría un número\nnegativo, lo que permitiría generar monedas de la nada. Un atacante podría\nagregar una cantidad de salida negativa y otra salida diferente, generando\nmonedas adicionales. La producción negativa haría que los compromisos aún sumen\ncero.\nLa desventaja de las pruebas de alcance es que son bastante pesadas en la\nblockchain. Su tamaño escala linealmente con el número de salidas en una\ntransacción y los bits en el rango de la prueba. De hecho, debido a su\nnaturaleza pesada, las pruebas de rango ocupan la mayor parte del tamaño de una\ntransacción a ciegas.\nEsta inconveniente realidad hace que cualquiera que esté pensando en usar el\nprotocolo tendrá que realizar transacciones con montos más grandes que las\nregulares. Una transacción más grande no sólo significa comisiones más altas,\nsino que también el tamaño de la blockchain crece exponencialmente junto con el\nuso. En otras palabras, se vuelve más inconveniente ejecutar la blockchain a\nmedida que se registran más y más transacciones de CT. Este problema de\nescalabilidad es una de las principales razones por las que el equipo de Particl\nse abstuvo de trasladar su implementación de RingCT a la red principal de\nParticl. Debido a que este proyecto tiene en mente una visión a largo plazo, se\nprefirió esperar hasta que se encontrara una solución adecuada a este problema\nde escalabilidad. Y luego vino Bulletproofs (pruebas antibalas).\n\nBulletproofs (Antibalas):\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n   [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf]\n * Informe de la auditoría de Quarkslab sobre la implementación de Bulletproofs\n   de Particl: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n   [https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n   .\n\nBulletproofs es una nueva generación de pruebas de rango que escalan\nlogarítmicamente en lugar de linealmente. En su documento técnico\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] , se les conoce como pruebas breves no\ninteractivas de conocimiento nulo . En términos simples, Bulletproofs es una\nmejora revolucionaria con respecto a las pruebas de rango regular, ya que\nreducen su tamaño en aproximadamente un 70% . Y, debido a que las pruebas de\nrango constituyen la mayor parte del tamaño de una transacción CT, a su vez\nreduce las tarifas de transacción y el espacio que ocupan en la cadena de\nbloques en la misma proporción.\n\n> Dato curioso: El término \"Antibalas\" fue acuñado por Shashank Agrawal cuando\ndescribió el nuevo tipo de antibalas como \"corto como una bala, con un supuesto\nde seguridad antibalas\".\nTransacciones anónimas – RingTC\n * Protocolo: RingCT\n * Nivel de privacidad: Alto (los montos de las transacciones y los usuarios\n   están ocultos).\n * Costo de transacción: De medio a alto, dependiendo de la cantidad de mixins\n   utilizados en las firmas de anillo o el tamaño de los anillos.\n * Costo de transacción para una configuración bajo: 0.003232 PART.\n * Costo de transacción para una configuración de privacidad alta: 0.009032\n   PART.\n * Segwit: Sí (reduce el peso de la transacción en un 47%).\n * Bulletproofs (Antibalas): Sí (reduce el tamaño de las pruebas de alcance en\n   un 70%).\n * Configuración confiable: no.\n * Salidas programables: no.\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n   [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf]\n\nUna transacción a ciegas en la blockchain de Particl (Fee: 0.005708 PART por 8\nmiembros de anillo y 2 entradas)Las transacciones anónimas (Anon transactions),\ncómo es llamado en Particl Desktop, llevan la privacidad al siguiente nivel, no\nsólo ocultando los montos de las transacciones, sino también la identidad de las\npartes que realizan la transacción (el remitente y el receptor). Este tipo de\ntransacciones utilizan el protocolo de privacidad RingCT, un protocolo que se\nhizo popular por Monero, pero adaptado por el equipo de Particl para trabajar\ncon el código base de Bitcoin. Esto permite que la plataforma se beneficie del\nprotocolo de privacidad líder en la industria, que es RingCT, pero sacando\nventaja de la seguridad, estabilidad y comunidad de desarrolladores que ofrece\nBitcoin. En otras palabras, RingCT con el código base de Bitcoin es como tener\nun  pastel y poder comértelo. Lo bueno sin lo malo.\n\nComo buenos ejemplos de esto son: RingCT pudiendo ser usado con la ayuda de\nscripts especiales, en atomic swaps (intercambios atómicos), aplicaciones\ndescentralizadas (como el mercado abierto de Partcl), Lightning Network, etc.\nTambién permite que RingCT esté vinculado directamente a transacciones CT, para\nque pueda alcanzar la capacidad de programación, como veremos más adelante en\neste artículo.\n\nDe igual manera que las transacciones a ciegas que utilizan el protocolo CT, las\ntransacciones anónimas son completamente desconfiadas y no dependen de ningún\ntipo de configuración confiable. Es importante tener en cuenta que las\ntransacciones RingCT son un poco más grandes que las transacciones\nconfidenciales, aunque no por un gran margen. Esto gracias a las firmas de\nanillo (MLSAG) que se añaden a la receta.\n\n> Dato curioso: RingCT se implementó inicialmente sobre el código base de\nCryptonote(Monero). El equipo de Particl es el primero en desarrollar una\nimplementación personalizada, la cual  podría funcionar en cualquier otro código\nbase, en este caso el código base de Bitcoin.\nFirmas de anillo (MLSAG)\n * Informe de la auditoría realizada por Quarkslab sobre la implementación de\n   MLSAG en Particl \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n   [https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n\nLas Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures (MLSAG), o firmas\nde anillo, son la parte anillada de RingCT. Es un tipo de firma digital que es\nrealizada por muchas salidas a la vez dentro de un grupo determinado de salidas\nRingCT (representadas por balances anónimos en la Particl Desktop), haciendo que \nsea imposible para cualquiera espectador darse cuenta cuál de las salidas,\ndentro de esa firma de anillo, es la que está enviando la transacción.\n\nWikipedia define las firmas de anillo de la siguiente manera:  “Una firma de\nanillo es un tipo de firma digital que puede ser creada por cualquier miembro de\nun grupo de usuarios, en el que cada usuario tiene su clave. Por lo tanto, un\nmensaje firmado con una firma de anillo está respaldado por alguno de los\nmiembros de ese grupo creado para tal fin”. \n\nUna de las propiedades de seguridad que las firmas de anillo deben cumplir es\nque no debe ser posible averiguar qué clave concreta de los usuarios del grupo\nfue utilizada para calcular la firma.\n\nEn el caso de RingCT, la firma digital utilizada para ejecutar una transacción\npodría haberse originado en cualquier miembro del grupo de anillo. Los usuarios\ncolocan parte de sus fondos en un balance anónimo. Los fondos que están dentro\nde un balance anónimo, se utilizan para ejecutar transacciones RingCT. Antes de\nque se ejecute una transacción, el protocolo firma anónimamente usando otras\nsalidas RingCT como señuelo, produciendo una firma que cuando es verificada,\nparece que pudo haber sido iniciada por cualquiera de los propietarios de las\nsalidas RingCT, utilizadas por el grupo de anillo. No hay forma de saber quién\nrealizó la transacción porque podría ser cualquiera de los miembros del grupo de\nanillo, ya que todos comparten la misma salida señuelo.\n\nEsto anonimiza, de manera efectiva, todos los valores que contiene una\ntransacción. El monto transferido, así como el remitente y el destinatario de la\ntransacción. También arma a las partes en la transacción con una negación\nplausible muy fuerte (1, 2).\n\nCómo hacer una transacción anónima  (RingCT) en Partcl Desktop\n\nUna transaccion de RingCT contiene 24 miembros de anillo\nEn Particl Desktop, es posible elegir la cantidad de miembros que deseas tener\ndentro del grupo de anillo que vas a utilizar para anonimizar tud transacciones.\nEn el cliente, esto significa un NÚMERO DE SIGNOS DE ANILLO.\n\nEsto simplemente significa que por cada entrada utilizada para generar su\ntransacción, otras series de salidas serán utilizadas para crear una firma\ndigital que pudo haber sido asignada a cualquiera de los 24 participantes. En\ncaptura de pantalla anterior se selecciona el valor 24. Esto significa que se\nusarán 23 salidas falsas y 1 real (el remitente de la transacción) para ofuscar\nla transacción (en el caso de que tenga sólo 1 entrada). Si la transacción\nutiliza 3 entradas, se generarán 3 firmas, una para cada entrada, con 3 grupos\nde anillo diferentes de 24 participantes cada uno, para ejecutar las\ntransacciones. Esto puede parecer complicado, pero no te preocupes, Particl\nDesktop hace todo por ti y hace que las transacciones de RingCT sean tan fáciles\nde enviar como cualquier otro tipo de transacción.\n\nPara realizar una transacción RingCT, simplemente ve a la pestaña Enviar /\nConvertir, elije el tipo de transacción anónima, haz clic en Opciones avanzadas \ny pose el mouse en NIVEL DE PRIVACIDAD (NÚMERO DE SIGNOS DEL ANILLO), que\naparece en la esquina inferior izquierda de la página. El valor que elijas será\nigual al número de miembros del anillo que formarán parte de tu grupo de anillo.\nDe hecho, puedes posarte sobre esta opción, sin clickear, y usar el nivel\npredeterminado de privacidad (8 miembros del anillo). Esto representa un buen\nequilibrio entre privacidad y costo.\n\n> Mientras más entradas utilices para realizar una transacción RingCT, y más\nmiembros del anillo (RING SIGS) se seleccionen antes de realizar una\ntransacción, más costosa se vuelve, pero también será más privada. Si a ti no te\nimporta el costo de una transacción, y lo que deseas es una máxima privacidad,\ncrea transacciones con la mayor cantidad de miembros de anillo y entradas como\nsea posible.\nManteniendo un buen nivel de privacidad\n\nComo regla general y en teoría, RingCT se vuelve más privado a medida que más\npersonas convierten sus saldos públicos en anónimos, creando así más salidas\nanónimas para ser utilizadas por grupos de anillo en transacciones RingCT. Esto\nse debe a que RingCT se basa en los resultados de otras personas para negar, de\nmanera plausible, qué salida realmente firmó una transacción, y también, \nmientras más salidas RingCT haya para firmar transacciones, más fuerte será la\nprivacidad y negación plausible de RingCT.\n\nPero, aunque las salidas son seleccionadas al azar desde cualquier salida\nanónima en la cadena, la mayoría de las veces se seleccionan de las\ntransacciones RingCT más recientes. La razón por la que el protocolo se comporta\nde esta manera es en respuesta a este artículo de investigación\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/], el cual demuestra que se puede suponer que\nlas entradas reales son las más recientes si todos los \"mixins\" están mucho más\nprofundos en la cadena, y no han tenido transacciones en un tiempo.\n\nPor esta razón, se recomienda que todos los usuarios tengan un saldo o balance\nanónimo. De este modo la red pueda utilizar automáticamente (sin costo para los\nusuarios, por supuesto). Adicionalmente, también se recomienda que los usuarios\nrealicen la mayor cantidad posible de transacciones anónimas para contribuir a\nmejorar la privacidad de toda la red. Ten en cuenta que nada de esto es\nnecesario para ejecutar una transacción RingCT, pero mientras más gente lo haga,\nmás fuerte y resistente se vuelve para todos. Esta es una de las principales\nrazones por las que el Open Marketplace de Particl va a utilizar,\npredeterminadamente, RingCT en todas sus transacciones. La mejor manera de\nincrementar el grupo de RingCT, es a través de la actividad transaccional y el\nuso actual de la tecnología. Predeterminar el uso de RingCT en la plataforma\nprincipal es lo más adecuado, en vista que contribuirá en gran medida a que el\nprotocolo RingCT de Particl sea mucho más sólido.\n\nDirecciones ocultas\n\nParticl permite que cualquiera use direcciones ocultas en lugar de las públicas\nusuales. Las direcciones ocultas son direcciones únicas que aumentan la\nprivacidad, porque sólo el propietario de la misma puede saber si una salida le\npertenece o no. Lo que se entiende por \"dirección única\" es que una dirección\noculta puede recibir muchos pagos, pero, a su vez, genera una nueva \"dirección\núnica\" para esa salida / transacción.\n\nSin conocer la clave privada de una dirección, nadie podrá asociar y adivinar\nqué salidas coinciden con cualquier dirección oculta. Esto ayuda a proteger la\nidentidad del receptor de una transacción. Por sí solas, las direcciones ocultas\nprobablemente no sean suficientes para proteger la información de las\ntransacciones de cualquier observador bien financiado y motivado (es decir, un\nactor estatal), pero cuando se combinan con protocolos de privacidad más fuertes\ncomo CT o RingCT, brinda otra capa de privacidad para el usuario.\nEn Particl Desktop las direcciones ocultas se llaman direcciones privadas y se\nusan por defecto en las transacciones anonimas. En la actualidad, las\ntransacciones a ciegas (CT) y anónimas (RingCT) sólo se pueden realizar en\ndirecciones ocultas.\n\nCT + RingCT juntos = Posibilidades infinitas.\n\nAmbos protocolos de privacidad tienen sus pros y sus contras, pero una de las\ndiferencias más notables entre estos dos protocolos de Particl, es el hecho de\nque CT tiene salidas programables, mientras que RingCT no. Esto se traduce a\nque, RingCT, tal como está, no puede usarse dentro de los contratos\ninteligentes. Sin embargo, eso no significa que no se pueda utilizar en\naplicaciones descentralizadas.\n\n¿Cómo puede ser posible, si RingCT no puede ser usado en contratos inteligentes? \nEsta es una de las principales razones por las que Particl mantiene en su red\nambos protocolos, CT y RingCT, en lugar de uno sólo.\n\nDe hecho, debido a que las transacciones CT tienen salidas programables, pueden\nusarse en contratos inteligentes y luego vincularse fácilmente a transacciones\nRingCT. El beneficio de la implementación de Particl es que las salidas se\npueden gastar de RingCT a CT, para lo que requiera un script, y luego enviarse\nde vuelta a RingCT.\n\nEl mejor ejemplo para ilustrar este concepto es el Open Marketplace de Particl.\nEs, por defecto, un mercado privado que utiliza RingCT para hacer las\ntransacciones del mercado lo más anónimas posibles. Lo que pocas personas saben\nes que el Marketplace usa una combinación de RingCT (la transacción) y CT (el\ncontrato inteligente) para su sistema de depósito en garantía, no sólo RingCT.\nEsto se debe a que el sistema de depósito en garantía del Marketplace se basa en\nla funcionalidad de contrato inteligente, lo que requiere que las transacciones\ntengan salidas programables (de ahí la razón por la que utiliza CT). Sin\nembargo, para interactuar con el contrato inteligente, los usuarios deben\nenviarle una transacción RingCT, que el mercado convierte automáticamente en una\ntransacción CT durante la duración del depósito en garantía. Una vez que las\npartes que realizan la transacción la liberan, esta se realiza finalmente como\nuna transacción RingCT.\n\n> Una salida RingCT se convierte en una salida CT, que a su vez forma las entradas\ndel contrato de depósito en garantía. Cuando el depósito en garantía esté listo\npara ser liberado o reembolsado, se entregará directamente a una salida RingCT.\n- Kewde [https://github.com/kewde/], Particl Developer y el autor de OMP Library\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/]. \nEste es sólo un ejemplo de cómo RingCT puede dar todo su potencial y aprovechar\nlos ecosistemas de Particl y Bitcoin, utilizando su contraparte CT. Esta técnica\nse puede aplicar para integrar RingCT a otros protocolos o servicios, como los\nintercambios atómicos, Lightning Network, otras aplicaciones descentralizadas,\netc.\n\nSi te gustó este artículo, no dudes en compartirlo, y atento, ya que en el\nfuturo se publicarán más artículos Explicando a Particl en particl.news\n[https://particl.news].","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/1-rkVSTNwf1chX8iU-XiExbg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/1-rkVSTNwf1chX8iU-XiExbg.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/1-rkVSTNwf1chX8iU-XiExbg.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/1-rkVSTNwf1chX8iU-XiExbg.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/1-rkVSTNwf1chX8iU-XiExbg.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>Esta serie explicará algunos de los aspectos técnicos de la plataforma Particl de una manera que todos puedan entender.

Debido a que la plataforma Particl ha construido su cadena de bloques basada en el código base de Bitcoin, las transacciones públicas se registran en la cadena de bloques de la misma manera que esperaría que se registren las transacciones de Bitcoin.</p><blockquote> <em>El nucleo de Particl está siempre actualizado con las versiones del núcleo de Bitcoin, lo que significa que todas las correcciones, parches de seguridad y actualizaciones para el núcleo de Bitcoin también se integran en el núcleo de Particl.</em></blockquote><p><strong>Al contrario de lo que mucha gente afirma, Bitcoin no es anónimo. De hecho, es todo lo contrario.</strong> Las transacciones de Bitcoin (y las transacciones de Particl, por proxy) son lo que llamamos transacciones <strong>seudónimas</strong> y son bastante transparentes. En lugar de que cada transacción esté vinculada a una persona, está vinculada a un seudónimo alfanumérico compuesto por números y caracteres variados y diferentes.<br><br>Si bien esto, probablemente, sea suficiente para proteger tus datos personales de otros, el sólido análisis protocolar que realiza la blockchain hace que sea demasiado fácil para cualquier curioso, lo que motiva a terceros a ahondar en la blockchain, rastreando así a los usuarios. Este rastreo se vuelve sumamente fácil, en el momento en que se realiza un pago a cualquier servicio que necesariamente vincula las direcciones con las identidades (exchanges, procesadores de pagos, proveedores, etc.).<br><br>Por esta razón, el equipo de Particl ha implementado dos diferentes protocolos de privacidad, que logran ocultar las transacciones en las blockchains. Ambos protocolos no requieren de ninguna configuración confiable y tienen denominadores comunes, pero también tienen diferentes propósitos dentro de la plataforma Particl, así como diferentes niveles de privacidad.</p><h2 id=\"transacciones-a-ciegas-blind-ct-\">Transacciones a ciegas — Blind (CT)</h2><h3 id=\"transacciones-confidenciales\"><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">Transacciones confidenciales</a></h3><p><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong><u>Elementos: una blockchain  de código abierto con capacidad para cadenas laterales.</u></strong></a><a href=\"http://localhost:2368/p/57832095-bcbd-4135-a3a5-aadf55f99fe8/elementsproject.org\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><u>elementsproject.org</u></a><br></p><ul><li>Protocolo: <strong>Transacciones confidenciales (CT)</strong></li><li>Nivel de privacidad: <strong>Medio (los montos de las transacción están ocultos).</strong></li><li>Costo por transacción: <strong>Medio (~ 0.001962 PART).</strong></li><li>Segwit: <strong>Sí (reduce el peso de las transacciones de CT en un 48%).</strong></li><li>Bulletproofs (prueba antibalas): <strong>sí (reduce el tamaño de las pruebas de rango en un 70%).</strong></li><li>Configuración confiable: <strong>No.</strong></li><li>Salidas programables: <strong>Sí.</strong></li><li>Whitepaper:<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> <u>https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</u></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Una transacción a ciegas en la blockchain de Particl <strong>(Fee: 0.001962 PART)</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Las transacciones a ciegas son transacciones de <strong>divisas que tienen sus montos de transacción ocultos en la cadena de bloques</strong> y solo las dos partes que realizan la transacción(el remitente y el receptor) las conocen.

Particularmente se usa lo que llamamos una <strong>prueba de rango</strong>, la cual garantiza que la cantidad de monedas enviadas en una transacción determinada esté entre dos valores.</p><h3 id=\"prueba-de-rango\">Prueba de rango</h3><p><br>Una prueba de rango es un protocolo criptográfico que se utiliza para <strong>verificar que el monto de un pago sea positivo o cero, sin revelar realmente el monto transferido en la transacción</strong> . Sin pruebas de rango, los montos en una transacción podrían establecerse tan grandes que se consideraría un número negativo, lo que permitiría generar monedas de la nada. Un atacante podría agregar una cantidad de salida negativa y otra salida diferente, generando monedas adicionales. La producción negativa haría que los compromisos aún sumen cero.<br>La desventaja de las pruebas de alcance es que son bastante pesadas en la blockchain. Su tamaño escala linealmente con el número de salidas en una transacción y los bits en el rango de la prueba. De hecho, debido a su naturaleza pesada, <strong>las pruebas de rango ocupan la mayor parte del tamaño de una transacción a ciegas.</strong><br>Esta inconveniente realidad hace que cualquiera que esté pensando en usar el protocolo tendrá que realizar transacciones con montos más grandes que las regulares. Una transacción más grande no sólo significa comisiones más altas, sino que también el tamaño de la blockchain crece exponencialmente junto con el uso. En otras palabras, se vuelve más inconveniente ejecutar la blockchain a medida que se registran más y más transacciones de CT. Este problema de escalabilidad es una de las principales razones por las que el equipo de Particl se abstuvo de trasladar su implementación de RingCT a la red principal de Particl. Debido a que este proyecto tiene en mente una visión a largo plazo, se prefirió esperar hasta que se encontrara una solución adecuada a este problema de escalabilidad. Y luego vino Bulletproofs (pruebas antibalas).</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs-antibalas-\">Bulletproofs (Antibalas):</h3><ul><li>Whitepaper:<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> <u>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</u></a></li><li>Informe de la auditoría de Quarkslab sobre la implementación de Bulletproofs de Particl:<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> <u>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</u></a>.</li></ul><p>Bulletproofs es una nueva generación de pruebas de rango que escalan logarítmicamente en lugar de linealmente.

Este tipo de transacciones utilizan el protocolo de privacidad RingCT, un protocolo que se hizo popular por Monero, pero <strong>adaptado por el equipo de Particl para trabajar con el código base de Bitcoin.</strong> Esto permite que la plataforma se beneficie del protocolo de privacidad líder en la industria, que es RingCT, pero sacando ventaja de la seguridad, estabilidad y comunidad de desarrolladores que ofrece Bitcoin. En otras palabras, RingCT con el código base de Bitcoin es como tener un  pastel y poder comértelo. Lo bueno sin lo malo.<br><br>Como buenos ejemplos de esto son: RingCT pudiendo ser usado con la ayuda de scripts especiales, en atomic swaps (intercambios atómicos), aplicaciones descentralizadas (como el mercado abierto de Partcl), Lightning Network, etc. También permite que RingCT esté vinculado directamente a transacciones CT, para que pueda alcanzar la capacidad de programación, como veremos más adelante en este artículo.<br><br>De igual manera que las transacciones a ciegas que utilizan el protocolo CT, las transacciones anónimas son completamente desconfiadas y no dependen de ningún tipo de configuración confiable. Es importante tener en cuenta que las transacciones RingCT son un poco más grandes que las transacciones confidenciales, aunque no por un gran margen. Esto gracias a las firmas de anillo (MLSAG) que se añaden a la receta.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Dato curioso</em></strong><em>: RingCT se implementó inicialmente sobre el código base de Cryptonote(Monero).

Por lo tanto, un mensaje firmado con una firma de anillo está respaldado por alguno de los miembros de ese grupo creado para tal fin”. <br><br>Una de las propiedades de seguridad que las firmas de anillo deben cumplir es que no debe ser posible averiguar qué clave concreta de los usuarios del grupo fue utilizada para calcular la firma.<br><br>En el caso de RingCT, la firma digital utilizada para ejecutar una transacción podría haberse originado en cualquier miembro del grupo de anillo. Los usuarios colocan parte de sus fondos en un balance anónimo. Los fondos que están dentro de un balance anónimo, se utilizan para ejecutar transacciones RingCT. Antes de que se ejecute una transacción, el protocolo firma anónimamente <strong>usando otras salidas RingCT como señuelo</strong>, produciendo una firma que cuando es verificada, parece que pudo haber sido iniciada por cualquiera de los propietarios de las salidas RingCT, utilizadas por el grupo de anillo. <strong>No hay forma de saber quién realizó la transacción porque podría ser cualquiera de los miembros del grupo de anillo, ya que todos comparten la misma salida señuelo.</strong><br><br><strong>Esto anonimiza, de manera efectiva, todos los valores que contiene una transacción. </strong>El monto transferido, así como el remitente y el destinatario de la transacción. También arma a las partes en la transacción con una negación plausible muy fuerte (1, 2).</p><p><strong>Cómo hacer una transacción anónima  (RingCT) en Partcl Desktop</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2538/1*9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Una transaccion de RingCT contiene 24 miembros de anillo</figcaption></figure><p><br>En Particl Desktop, es posible elegir la cantidad de miembros que deseas tener dentro del grupo de anillo que vas a utilizar para anonimizar tud transacciones. En el cliente, esto significa un NÚMERO DE SIGNOS DE ANILLO.<br><br>Esto simplemente significa que<strong> por cada entrada utilizada para generar su transacción, otras series de salidas serán utilizadas para crear una firma digital que pudo haber sido asignada a cualquiera de los 24 participantes</strong>. En captura de pantalla anterior se selecciona el valor 24. Esto significa que se usarán 23 salidas falsas y 1 real (el remitente de la transacción) para ofuscar la transacción (en el caso de que tenga sólo 1 entrada). Si la transacción utiliza 3 entradas, se generarán 3 firmas, una para cada entrada, con 3 grupos de anillo diferentes de 24 participantes cada uno, para ejecutar las transacciones. Esto puede parecer complicado, pero no te preocupes, Particl Desktop hace todo por ti y hace que las transacciones de RingCT sean tan fáciles de enviar como cualquier otro tipo de transacción.<br><br><strong>Para realizar una transacción RingCT</strong>, simplemente ve a la pestaña <strong>Enviar / Convertir</strong>, elije el tipo de transacción anónima, haz clic en <strong>Opciones avanzadas</strong> y pose el mouse en <strong>NIVEL DE PRIVACIDAD (NÚMERO DE SIGNOS DEL ANILLO)</strong>, que aparece en la esquina inferior izquierda de la página. El valor que elijas será igual al número de miembros del anillo que formarán parte de tu grupo de anillo. De hecho, puedes posarte sobre esta opción, sin clickear, y usar el nivel predeterminado de privacidad (8 miembros del anillo). Esto representa un buen equilibrio entre privacidad y costo.</p><blockquote><em>Mientras más entradas utilices para realizar una transacción RingCT, y más miembros del anillo (RING SIGS) se seleccionen antes de realizar una transacción, más costosa se vuelve, pero también será más privada. Si a ti no te importa el costo de una transacción, y lo que deseas es una máxima privacidad, crea transacciones con la mayor cantidad de miembros de anillo y entradas como sea posible.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"manteniendo-un-buen-nivel-de-privacidad\">Manteniendo un buen nivel de privacidad</h3><p><br>Como regla general y en teoría,<strong> RingCT se vuelve más privado a medida que más personas convierten sus saldos públicos en anónimos</strong>, creando así más salidas anónimas para ser utilizadas por grupos de anillo en transacciones RingCT. Esto se debe a que RingCT se basa en los resultados de otras personas para negar, de manera plausible, qué salida realmente firmó una transacción, y también, <strong>mientras más salidas RingCT haya para firmar transacciones, más fuerte será la privacidad y negación plausible de RingCT.</strong><br><br>Pero, aunque las salidas son seleccionadas al azar desde cualquier salida anónima en la cadena, la mayoría de las veces se seleccionan de las transacciones RingCT más recientes. La razón por la que el protocolo se comporta de esta manera es en respuesta a este<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> artículo de investigación</a>, el cual demuestra que se puede suponer que las entradas reales son las más recientes si todos los \"mixins\" están mucho más profundos en la cadena, y no han tenido transacciones en un tiempo.<br><br><strong>Por esta razón, se recomienda que todos los usuarios tengan un saldo o balance anónimo</strong>. De este modo la red pueda utilizar automáticamente (sin costo para los usuarios, por supuesto).<strong> Adicionalmente, también se recomienda que los usuarios realicen la mayor cantidad posible de transacciones anónimas</strong> para contribuir a mejorar la privacidad de toda la red. Ten en cuenta que nada de esto es necesario para ejecutar una transacción RingCT, pero mientras más gente lo haga, más fuerte y resistente se vuelve para todos. Esta es una de las principales razones por las que el Open Marketplace de Particl va a utilizar, predeterminadamente, RingCT en todas sus transacciones. La mejor manera de incrementar el grupo de RingCT, es a través de la actividad transaccional y el uso actual de la tecnología. Predeterminar el uso de RingCT en la plataforma principal es lo más adecuado, en vista que contribuirá en gran medida a que el protocolo RingCT de Particl sea mucho más sólido.</p><h2 id=\"direcciones-ocultas\">Direcciones ocultas</h2><p><br>Particl permite que cualquiera use direcciones ocultas en lugar de las públicas usuales. Las direcciones ocultas son direcciones únicas que aumentan la privacidad, porque <strong>sólo el propietario de la misma puede saber si una salida le pertenece o no. </strong>Lo que se entiende por \"dirección única\" es que una dirección oculta puede recibir muchos pagos, pero, a su vez, genera una nueva \"dirección única\" para esa salida / transacción.<br><br>Sin conocer la clave privada de una dirección, nadie podrá asociar y adivinar qué salidas coinciden con cualquier dirección oculta. <strong>Esto ayuda a proteger la identidad del receptor de una transacción. </strong>Por sí solas, las direcciones ocultas probablemente no sean suficientes para proteger la información de las transacciones de cualquier observador bien financiado y motivado (es decir, un actor estatal), pero cuando se combinan con protocolos de privacidad más fuertes como CT o RingCT, brinda otra capa de privacidad para el usuario.<br>En Particl Desktop las direcciones ocultas se llaman <strong>direcciones privadas </strong>y se usan por defecto en las transacciones anonimas. <strong>En la actualidad, las transacciones a ciegas (CT) y anónimas (RingCT) sólo se pueden realizar en direcciones ocultas.</strong></p><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-juntos-posibilidades-infinitas-\">CT + RingCT juntos = Posibilidades infinitas.</h2><p><br>Ambos protocolos de privacidad tienen sus pros y sus contras, pero una de las diferencias más notables entre estos dos protocolos de Particl, es el hecho de que CT tiene salidas programables, mientras que RingCT no. Esto se traduce a que, RingCT, tal como está, no puede usarse dentro de los contratos inteligentes. Sin embargo, eso no significa que no se pueda utilizar en aplicaciones descentralizadas.<br><br>¿Cómo puede ser posible, si RingCT no puede ser usado en contratos inteligentes? <strong>Esta es una de las principales razones por las que Particl mantiene en su red ambos protocolos, CT y RingCT, en lugar de uno sólo.</strong><br><br>De hecho, debido a que las transacciones CT tienen salidas programables, pueden usarse en contratos inteligentes y luego vincularse fácilmente a transacciones RingCT. El beneficio de la implementación de Particl es que las salidas se pueden gastar de RingCT a CT, para lo que requiera un script, y luego enviarse de vuelta a RingCT.<br><br>El mejor ejemplo para ilustrar este concepto es el Open Marketplace de Particl. Es, por defecto, <strong>un mercado privado que utiliza RingCT para hacer las transacciones del mercado lo más anónimas posibles</strong>. Lo que pocas personas saben es que el Marketplace usa una combinación de RingCT (la transacción) y CT (el contrato inteligente) para su sistema de depósito en garantía, no sólo RingCT.<br>Esto se debe a que el sistema de depósito en garantía del Marketplace se basa en la funcionalidad de contrato inteligente, lo que requiere que las transacciones tengan salidas programables (de ahí la razón por la que utiliza CT). Sin embargo, para interactuar con el contrato inteligente, los usuarios deben enviarle una transacción RingCT, que el mercado convierte automáticamente en una transacción CT durante la duración del depósito en garantía. Una vez que las partes que realizan la transacción la liberan, esta se realiza finalmente como una transacción RingCT.</p><blockquote><em>Una salida RingCT se convierte en una salida CT, que a su vez forma las entradas del contrato de depósito en garantía. Cuando el depósito en garantía esté listo para ser liberado o reembolsado, se entregará directamente a una salida RingCT. - </em><a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><em>Kewde</em></a><em>, </em><strong><em>Particl Developer y el autor de</em></strong><em> </em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><em>OMP Library</em></a><em>. </em></blockquote><p>Este es sólo un ejemplo de cómo RingCT puede dar todo su potencial y aprovechar los ecosistemas de Particl y Bitcoin, utilizando su contraparte CT.

Debido a que la plataforma Particl ha construido su cadena de bloques basada en el código base de Bitcoin, las transacciones públicas se registran en la cadena de bloques de la misma manera que esperaría que se registren las transacciones de Bitcoin.</p><blockquote> <em>El nucleo de Particl está siempre actualizado con las versiones del núcleo de Bitcoin, lo que significa que todas las correcciones, parches de seguridad y actualizaciones para el núcleo de Bitcoin también se integran en el núcleo de Particl.</em></blockquote><p><strong>Al contrario de lo que mucha gente afirma, Bitcoin no es anónimo. De hecho, es todo lo contrario.</strong> Las transacciones de Bitcoin (y las transacciones de Particl, por proxy) son lo que llamamos transacciones <strong>seudónimas</strong> y son bastante transparentes. En lugar de que cada transacción esté vinculada a una persona, está vinculada a un seudónimo alfanumérico compuesto por números y caracteres variados y diferentes.<br><br>Si bien esto, probablemente, sea suficiente para proteger tus datos personales de otros, el sólido análisis protocolar que realiza la blockchain hace que sea demasiado fácil para cualquier curioso, lo que motiva a terceros a ahondar en la blockchain, rastreando así a los usuarios. Este rastreo se vuelve sumamente fácil, en el momento en que se realiza un pago a cualquier servicio que necesariamente vincula las direcciones con las identidades (exchanges, procesadores de pagos, proveedores, etc.).<br><br>Por esta razón, el equipo de Particl ha implementado dos diferentes protocolos de privacidad, que logran ocultar las transacciones en las blockchains. Ambos protocolos no requieren de ninguna configuración confiable y tienen denominadores comunes, pero también tienen diferentes propósitos dentro de la plataforma Particl, así como diferentes niveles de privacidad.</p><h2 id=\"transacciones-a-ciegas-blind-ct-\">Transacciones a ciegas — Blind (CT)</h2><h3 id=\"transacciones-confidenciales\"><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">Transacciones confidenciales</a></h3><p><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong><u>Elementos: una blockchain  de código abierto con capacidad para cadenas laterales.</u></strong></a><a href=\"/p/57832095-bcbd-4135-a3a5-aadf55f99fe8/elementsproject.org\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><u>elementsproject.org</u></a><br></p><ul><li>Protocolo: <strong>Transacciones confidenciales (CT)</strong></li><li>Nivel de privacidad: <strong>Medio (los montos de las transacción están ocultos).</strong></li><li>Costo por transacción: <strong>Medio (~ 0.001962 PART).</strong></li><li>Segwit: <strong>Sí (reduce el peso de las transacciones de CT en un 48%).</strong></li><li>Bulletproofs (prueba antibalas): <strong>sí (reduce el tamaño de las pruebas de rango en un 70%).</strong></li><li>Configuración confiable: <strong>No.</strong></li><li>Salidas programables: <strong>Sí.</strong></li><li>Whitepaper:<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> <u>https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</u></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2020/12/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, /glink/2020/12/image-3.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Una transacción a ciegas en la blockchain de Particl <strong>(Fee: 0.001962 PART)</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Las transacciones a ciegas son transacciones de <strong>divisas que tienen sus montos de transacción ocultos en la cadena de bloques</strong> y solo las dos partes que realizan la transacción(el remitente y el receptor) las conocen.

Particularmente se usa lo que llamamos una <strong>prueba de rango</strong>, la cual garantiza que la cantidad de monedas enviadas en una transacción determinada esté entre dos valores.</p><h3 id=\"prueba-de-rango\">Prueba de rango</h3><p><br>Una prueba de rango es un protocolo criptográfico que se utiliza para <strong>verificar que el monto de un pago sea positivo o cero, sin revelar realmente el monto transferido en la transacción</strong> . Sin pruebas de rango, los montos en una transacción podrían establecerse tan grandes que se consideraría un número negativo, lo que permitiría generar monedas de la nada. Un atacante podría agregar una cantidad de salida negativa y otra salida diferente, generando monedas adicionales. La producción negativa haría que los compromisos aún sumen cero.<br>La desventaja de las pruebas de alcance es que son bastante pesadas en la blockchain. Su tamaño escala linealmente con el número de salidas en una transacción y los bits en el rango de la prueba. De hecho, debido a su naturaleza pesada, <strong>las pruebas de rango ocupan la mayor parte del tamaño de una transacción a ciegas.</strong><br>Esta inconveniente realidad hace que cualquiera que esté pensando en usar el protocolo tendrá que realizar transacciones con montos más grandes que las regulares. Una transacción más grande no sólo significa comisiones más altas, sino que también el tamaño de la blockchain crece exponencialmente junto con el uso. En otras palabras, se vuelve más inconveniente ejecutar la blockchain a medida que se registran más y más transacciones de CT. Este problema de escalabilidad es una de las principales razones por las que el equipo de Particl se abstuvo de trasladar su implementación de RingCT a la red principal de Particl. Debido a que este proyecto tiene en mente una visión a largo plazo, se prefirió esperar hasta que se encontrara una solución adecuada a este problema de escalabilidad. Y luego vino Bulletproofs (pruebas antibalas).</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs-antibalas-\">Bulletproofs (Antibalas):</h3><ul><li>Whitepaper:<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> <u>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</u></a></li><li>Informe de la auditoría de Quarkslab sobre la implementación de Bulletproofs de Particl:<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> <u>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</u></a>.</li></ul><p>Bulletproofs es una nueva generación de pruebas de rango que escalan logarítmicamente en lugar de linealmente.

Este tipo de transacciones utilizan el protocolo de privacidad RingCT, un protocolo que se hizo popular por Monero, pero <strong>adaptado por el equipo de Particl para trabajar con el código base de Bitcoin.</strong> Esto permite que la plataforma se beneficie del protocolo de privacidad líder en la industria, que es RingCT, pero sacando ventaja de la seguridad, estabilidad y comunidad de desarrolladores que ofrece Bitcoin. En otras palabras, RingCT con el código base de Bitcoin es como tener un  pastel y poder comértelo. Lo bueno sin lo malo.<br><br>Como buenos ejemplos de esto son: RingCT pudiendo ser usado con la ayuda de scripts especiales, en atomic swaps (intercambios atómicos), aplicaciones descentralizadas (como el mercado abierto de Partcl), Lightning Network, etc. También permite que RingCT esté vinculado directamente a transacciones CT, para que pueda alcanzar la capacidad de programación, como veremos más adelante en este artículo.<br><br>De igual manera que las transacciones a ciegas que utilizan el protocolo CT, las transacciones anónimas son completamente desconfiadas y no dependen de ningún tipo de configuración confiable. Es importante tener en cuenta que las transacciones RingCT son un poco más grandes que las transacciones confidenciales, aunque no por un gran margen. Esto gracias a las firmas de anillo (MLSAG) que se añaden a la receta.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Dato curioso</em></strong><em>: RingCT se implementó inicialmente sobre el código base de Cryptonote(Monero).

Por lo tanto, un mensaje firmado con una firma de anillo está respaldado por alguno de los miembros de ese grupo creado para tal fin”. <br><br>Una de las propiedades de seguridad que las firmas de anillo deben cumplir es que no debe ser posible averiguar qué clave concreta de los usuarios del grupo fue utilizada para calcular la firma.<br><br>En el caso de RingCT, la firma digital utilizada para ejecutar una transacción podría haberse originado en cualquier miembro del grupo de anillo. Los usuarios colocan parte de sus fondos en un balance anónimo. Los fondos que están dentro de un balance anónimo, se utilizan para ejecutar transacciones RingCT. Antes de que se ejecute una transacción, el protocolo firma anónimamente <strong>usando otras salidas RingCT como señuelo</strong>, produciendo una firma que cuando es verificada, parece que pudo haber sido iniciada por cualquiera de los propietarios de las salidas RingCT, utilizadas por el grupo de anillo. <strong>No hay forma de saber quién realizó la transacción porque podría ser cualquiera de los miembros del grupo de anillo, ya que todos comparten la misma salida señuelo.</strong><br><br><strong>Esto anonimiza, de manera efectiva, todos los valores que contiene una transacción. </strong>El monto transferido, así como el remitente y el destinatario de la transacción. También arma a las partes en la transacción con una negación plausible muy fuerte (1, 2).</p><p><strong>Cómo hacer una transacción anónima  (RingCT) en Partcl Desktop</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2538/1*9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Una transaccion de RingCT contiene 24 miembros de anillo</figcaption></figure><p><br>En Particl Desktop, es posible elegir la cantidad de miembros que deseas tener dentro del grupo de anillo que vas a utilizar para anonimizar tud transacciones. En el cliente, esto significa un NÚMERO DE SIGNOS DE ANILLO.<br><br>Esto simplemente significa que<strong> por cada entrada utilizada para generar su transacción, otras series de salidas serán utilizadas para crear una firma digital que pudo haber sido asignada a cualquiera de los 24 participantes</strong>. En captura de pantalla anterior se selecciona el valor 24. Esto significa que se usarán 23 salidas falsas y 1 real (el remitente de la transacción) para ofuscar la transacción (en el caso de que tenga sólo 1 entrada). Si la transacción utiliza 3 entradas, se generarán 3 firmas, una para cada entrada, con 3 grupos de anillo diferentes de 24 participantes cada uno, para ejecutar las transacciones. Esto puede parecer complicado, pero no te preocupes, Particl Desktop hace todo por ti y hace que las transacciones de RingCT sean tan fáciles de enviar como cualquier otro tipo de transacción.<br><br><strong>Para realizar una transacción RingCT</strong>, simplemente ve a la pestaña <strong>Enviar / Convertir</strong>, elije el tipo de transacción anónima, haz clic en <strong>Opciones avanzadas</strong> y pose el mouse en <strong>NIVEL DE PRIVACIDAD (NÚMERO DE SIGNOS DEL ANILLO)</strong>, que aparece en la esquina inferior izquierda de la página. El valor que elijas será igual al número de miembros del anillo que formarán parte de tu grupo de anillo. De hecho, puedes posarte sobre esta opción, sin clickear, y usar el nivel predeterminado de privacidad (8 miembros del anillo). Esto representa un buen equilibrio entre privacidad y costo.</p><blockquote><em>Mientras más entradas utilices para realizar una transacción RingCT, y más miembros del anillo (RING SIGS) se seleccionen antes de realizar una transacción, más costosa se vuelve, pero también será más privada. Si a ti no te importa el costo de una transacción, y lo que deseas es una máxima privacidad, crea transacciones con la mayor cantidad de miembros de anillo y entradas como sea posible.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"manteniendo-un-buen-nivel-de-privacidad\">Manteniendo un buen nivel de privacidad</h3><p><br>Como regla general y en teoría,<strong> RingCT se vuelve más privado a medida que más personas convierten sus saldos públicos en anónimos</strong>, creando así más salidas anónimas para ser utilizadas por grupos de anillo en transacciones RingCT. Esto se debe a que RingCT se basa en los resultados de otras personas para negar, de manera plausible, qué salida realmente firmó una transacción, y también, <strong>mientras más salidas RingCT haya para firmar transacciones, más fuerte será la privacidad y negación plausible de RingCT.</strong><br><br>Pero, aunque las salidas son seleccionadas al azar desde cualquier salida anónima en la cadena, la mayoría de las veces se seleccionan de las transacciones RingCT más recientes. La razón por la que el protocolo se comporta de esta manera es en respuesta a este<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"> artículo de investigación</a>, el cual demuestra que se puede suponer que las entradas reales son las más recientes si todos los \"mixins\" están mucho más profundos en la cadena, y no han tenido transacciones en un tiempo.<br><br><strong>Por esta razón, se recomienda que todos los usuarios tengan un saldo o balance anónimo</strong>. De este modo la red pueda utilizar automáticamente (sin costo para los usuarios, por supuesto).<strong> Adicionalmente, también se recomienda que los usuarios realicen la mayor cantidad posible de transacciones anónimas</strong> para contribuir a mejorar la privacidad de toda la red. Ten en cuenta que nada de esto es necesario para ejecutar una transacción RingCT, pero mientras más gente lo haga, más fuerte y resistente se vuelve para todos. Esta es una de las principales razones por las que el Open Marketplace de Particl va a utilizar, predeterminadamente, RingCT en todas sus transacciones. La mejor manera de incrementar el grupo de RingCT, es a través de la actividad transaccional y el uso actual de la tecnología. Predeterminar el uso de RingCT en la plataforma principal es lo más adecuado, en vista que contribuirá en gran medida a que el protocolo RingCT de Particl sea mucho más sólido.</p><h2 id=\"direcciones-ocultas\">Direcciones ocultas</h2><p><br>Particl permite que cualquiera use direcciones ocultas en lugar de las públicas usuales. Las direcciones ocultas son direcciones únicas que aumentan la privacidad, porque <strong>sólo el propietario de la misma puede saber si una salida le pertenece o no. </strong>Lo que se entiende por \"dirección única\" es que una dirección oculta puede recibir muchos pagos, pero, a su vez, genera una nueva \"dirección única\" para esa salida / transacción.<br><br>Sin conocer la clave privada de una dirección, nadie podrá asociar y adivinar qué salidas coinciden con cualquier dirección oculta. <strong>Esto ayuda a proteger la identidad del receptor de una transacción. </strong>Por sí solas, las direcciones ocultas probablemente no sean suficientes para proteger la información de las transacciones de cualquier observador bien financiado y motivado (es decir, un actor estatal), pero cuando se combinan con protocolos de privacidad más fuertes como CT o RingCT, brinda otra capa de privacidad para el usuario.<br>En Particl Desktop las direcciones ocultas se llaman <strong>direcciones privadas </strong>y se usan por defecto en las transacciones anonimas. <strong>En la actualidad, las transacciones a ciegas (CT) y anónimas (RingCT) sólo se pueden realizar en direcciones ocultas.</strong></p><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-juntos-posibilidades-infinitas-\">CT + RingCT juntos = Posibilidades infinitas.</h2><p><br>Ambos protocolos de privacidad tienen sus pros y sus contras, pero una de las diferencias más notables entre estos dos protocolos de Particl, es el hecho de que CT tiene salidas programables, mientras que RingCT no. Esto se traduce a que, RingCT, tal como está, no puede usarse dentro de los contratos inteligentes. Sin embargo, eso no significa que no se pueda utilizar en aplicaciones descentralizadas.<br><br>¿Cómo puede ser posible, si RingCT no puede ser usado en contratos inteligentes? <strong>Esta es una de las principales razones por las que Particl mantiene en su red ambos protocolos, CT y RingCT, en lugar de uno sólo.</strong><br><br>De hecho, debido a que las transacciones CT tienen salidas programables, pueden usarse en contratos inteligentes y luego vincularse fácilmente a transacciones RingCT. El beneficio de la implementación de Particl es que las salidas se pueden gastar de RingCT a CT, para lo que requiera un script, y luego enviarse de vuelta a RingCT.<br><br>El mejor ejemplo para ilustrar este concepto es el Open Marketplace de Particl. Es, por defecto, <strong>un mercado privado que utiliza RingCT para hacer las transacciones del mercado lo más anónimas posibles</strong>. Lo que pocas personas saben es que el Marketplace usa una combinación de RingCT (la transacción) y CT (el contrato inteligente) para su sistema de depósito en garantía, no sólo RingCT.<br>Esto se debe a que el sistema de depósito en garantía del Marketplace se basa en la funcionalidad de contrato inteligente, lo que requiere que las transacciones tengan salidas programables (de ahí la razón por la que utiliza CT). Sin embargo, para interactuar con el contrato inteligente, los usuarios deben enviarle una transacción RingCT, que el mercado convierte automáticamente en una transacción CT durante la duración del depósito en garantía. Una vez que las partes que realizan la transacción la liberan, esta se realiza finalmente como una transacción RingCT.</p><blockquote><em>Una salida RingCT se convierte en una salida CT, que a su vez forma las entradas del contrato de depósito en garantía. Cuando el depósito en garantía esté listo para ser liberado o reembolsado, se entregará directamente a una salida RingCT. - </em><a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><em>Kewde</em></a><em>, </em><strong><em>Particl Developer y el autor de</em></strong><em> </em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><em>OMP Library</em></a><em>. </em></blockquote><p>Este es sólo un ejemplo de cómo RingCT puede dar todo su potencial y aprovechar los ecosistemas de Particl y Bitcoin, utilizando su contraparte CT.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
