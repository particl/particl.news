In October 2017\nthey came up with the idea of doing a podcast together which turned out to be a\nbig success. Every month since then they’ve released a podcast\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVVDsIYJBQ_C7Bh_aI3ZMxQ] which is an\ninteresting combination of news, technical issues explained in a way that\neveryone can understand it and humour. In May 2018 the 4 friends all went to\nConsensus. After the initial shock of seeing so little technical content and so\nmany scammy ICOs, they came up with the idea of doing Magical Crypto Conference:\nan affordable, content-driven conference aimed at both technical and\nless-technical people. —MagicalCryptoConference.com\n[https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#about_us]\nMagical Crypto Conference is an event created in response to Consensus. Instead\nof focusing on sales pitches and fanfares like its counterpart, it showcases the\nadvancement in the tech and the projects backing this global financial\nrevolution that is cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also assembles a top quality lineup of speakers composed of the best minds in\nthe industry such as Adam Back, Andrew Poelstra, Charlie Lee, Elizabeth Stark,\nJameson Lopp, Jimmy Song, Peter Todd, Riccardo Spagni, Samson Mow, only to name\na few. In fact, MCC will boast an impressive lineup of more than 40+ speakers\n[https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#speakers]. It also attracts the top\njournalists and media outlets covering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is going to be present at the conference with a booth to demonstrate the\nOpen Marketplace to a crowd of cypherpunks, crypto & privacy enthusiasts, as\nwell as tech junkies. What’s even more exciting is that the event will only have\na handful of booths on display (less than 20), meaning each one of them will get\nmore exposure without being flooded under a sea of seemingly random ICOs. The\nsmaller scale of this event compared to Consensus allows for a much more\nintimate and personal experience with the true leaders behind the crypto\nmovement.\n\n> If you’re going to Consensus and not the Magical Crypto Conference, you are\ndoing it wrong. —Peter McCormack\n[https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack/status/1114531640301297665]\nNot only will this be a great moment to showcase the marketplace and the need\nfor privacy in the eCommerce in front of a crowd of people that actually\nunderstands blockchain and Bitcoin, but it will also be a great moment to meet\nYOU there! In fact, MCC’s tickets are pretty affordable\n[https://www.bigneon.com/events/858ae17f-2582-412b-b581-bd5f5c2efeff/tickets] \n(currently $330). If you wanted to go to at least one event during the\nBlockchain Week NYC, this is the one that will most definitely give you the best\nbang for your buck.\n\n> \nWe surely hope to see you there! Drop us a message on Discord if you plan on\nattending the event and we’ll make sure to meet up during the conference.

Every month since then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVVDsIYJBQ_C7Bh_aI3ZMxQ\">they’ve released a podcast</a> which is an interesting combination of news, technical issues explained in a way that everyone can understand it and humour. In May 2018 the 4 friends all went to Consensus. After the initial shock of seeing so little technical content and so many scammy ICOs, they came up with the idea of doing Magical Crypto Conference: an affordable, content-driven conference aimed at both technical and less-technical people. — <a href=\"https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#about_us\"><strong>MagicalCryptoConference.com</strong></a></blockquote><p>Magical Crypto Conference is an event created in response to Consensus. Instead of focusing on sales pitches and fanfares like its counterpart, it showcases the advancement in the tech and the projects backing this global financial revolution that is cryptocurrencies.</p><p>It also assembles a top quality lineup of speakers composed of the best minds in the industry such as Adam Back, Andrew Poelstra, Charlie Lee, Elizabeth Stark, Jameson Lopp, Jimmy Song, Peter Todd, Riccardo Spagni, Samson Mow, only to name a few. In fact, MCC will boast an impressive lineup of <a href=\"https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#speakers\"><strong>more than 40+ speakers</strong></a>. It also attracts the top journalists and media outlets covering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p><hr><p>Particl is going to be present at the conference with a booth to demonstrate the Open Marketplace to a crowd of cypherpunks, crypto &amp; privacy enthusiasts, as well as tech junkies. What’s even more exciting is that the event will only have a handful of booths on display (less than 20), meaning each one of them will get more exposure without being flooded under a sea of seemingly random ICOs. The smaller scale of this event compared to Consensus allows for a much more intimate and personal experience with the true leaders behind the crypto movement.</p><blockquote>If you’re going to Consensus and not the Magical Crypto Conference, you are doing it wrong. — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack/status/1114531640301297665\">Peter McCormack</a></blockquote><p>Not only will this be a great moment to showcase the marketplace and the need for privacy in the eCommerce in front of a crowd of people that actually understands blockchain and Bitcoin, but it will also be a great moment to meet YOU there! In fact, <a href=\"https://www.bigneon.com/events/858ae17f-2582-412b-b581-bd5f5c2efeff/tickets\"><strong>MCC’s tickets are pretty affordable</strong></a><strong> </strong>(currently $330).

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
