This is the\ndecentralized marketplace Minimal Viable Product (MVP) everyone is most excited\nfor. Alpha will be well designed and bring major protocol changes.\n\nRingCT on mainnet, the audit of Particl Core (including RingCT) and our\nuniversity Research Grant all will likely fall into Q4 as well. This is a good\nexample of versioning on our roadmap. Version 1.1 will get to a point it is no\nlonger useful, at which time we will update it to better reflect real-time\nactivity on the project. RingCT, for example, will be a planned hardfork on\nParticl blockchain so releasing it with other Q4 protocol changes will be\nconsidered by the team.\n\nWhen we launched the Particl blockchain, 996,000 PART tokens were created and\ntime locked in a multi-sig address* that was reserved for our Primary funding\nround.
