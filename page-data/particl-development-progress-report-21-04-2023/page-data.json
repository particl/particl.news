upcoming Monerotopia speech\n[https://monerotopia.com/], and expanding on some of the topics raised in this\nprevious article [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]\n, this article goes over our thoughts on privacy and interoperability in\nprivacy-centric projects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe current state of the world is a cause for great concern, particularly for\nthose who support freedom and oppose censorship, value independent thought, and\nprioritize personal privacy. Global economies are facing an unprecedented\ncrisis, and governments are enacting increasingly oppressive measures that\nthreaten individual autonomy, even discussing outright bans on encryption. It is\nbecoming increasingly difficult to protect one's freedom on a daily basis.\n\nFortunately, the advent of Bitcoin provided a glimmer of hope. In the years to\ncome, the release of Bitcoin may likely be viewed as one of the most influential\nevents in modern history, given that blockchain and decentralized networks\nprovide us with concrete tools to resist those who seek to restrict our rights\nand freedoms.\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto brought this incredible gift to the world, humanity stood\non the precipice. However, Satoshi's legacy now rests with us, as we continue to\npush the boundaries of privacy coins by adding more robust obfuscation layers\nand anonymizing transactions, thereby preventing cryptocurrencies from becoming\na financial surveillance tool.\n\nUltimately, the cypherpunk mission, as bold as it is, is to build a parallel\neconomy, completely independent and separate from the global fiat system, in\nwhich its users can accomplish their everyday needs without having to depend on\nlegacy financial systems anymore.\n\nThis article is about the survival of our privacy and liberties within a world\nthat is actively seeking to destroy them and what we believe the path forward\nis.\n\nPrivacy, Intercompatibility, and Resilience\nCompetition can be a driving force for progress, motivating individuals to\nperform better, increase productivity, and push the boundaries of innovation,\nultimately resulting in enhanced benefits for end-users.\n\nHowever, while this holds true in crypto, it also creates avoidable tensions\nbetween projects and often leads to a situation where the innovations of one\nproject are overlooked by those who do not possess a financial stake in that\nparticular project. This division in the community limits our collective\ncapacity to address the imminent challenges to privacy that we previously\noutlined, a suboptimal outcome given the substantial force wielded by those who\nseek to undermine our freedoms.\n\nUltimately, to stand a chance against this opposition, we should strive to\nembrace our uniqueness and foster creativity; different projects working on\ndifferent ideas and solutions, but we must unite together in a decentralized,\nprivate, and free economy in which all of our projects thrive and can be\nintegrated.\n\nTo do just that, we are presently focused on a comprehensive improvement of our\necosystem codebase\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], which is\ndesigned to reflect our core values. Among them:\n\n * Privacy, obviously.\n * Uncompromising decentralization.\n * And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies\n   with which our dApps function.\n\nWith an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy\nprojects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This\nallows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing\nwithin an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys\nextremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.\n\nEmbodying Agnosticism\nThe Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are\ncurrently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing\nfor various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order\nto power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.\n\nFor instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own\nnative SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our\nmodular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and\nonly request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an\nSMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.\n\nAdopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other\ncompatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps.\nThe final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements\nof their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.\n\nThis not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use\ncases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to\nParticl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have\nworked on.\n\nIt also makes them more resilient.\nConsider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable\nits distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that\nSMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event.\nAlthough such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a\nminor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an\nalternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user\nwould lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers\nfails to act in a timely manner.\n\nThis is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas\nother projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without\ncompeting with each other but without having to start developing together. We\ncould sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples,\nbut I think you get the gist.\n\nBecause technology advances so fast, we must build solutions that will endure\nthe test of time. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger,\ntogether, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the\nperfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.\n\nHowever, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules.\nAfter all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have\nunique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.\n\nIn our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in\nwhich SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl\ndApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying\nthe different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy\nand freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.\n\nCurrency Agnosticism \nCurrency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in\nprivacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example:\nyou can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without\nthird-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely\ndifferent coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so.\nThis introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in\norder to acquire this specific coin.\n\nThat is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re\ncurrently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for\nother coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end\nswap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.\n\nWhile several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges,\ncan be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal\noutcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by the Changelly\ndebacle\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/] \nwithin the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a free,\nindependent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy without central points of\nfailure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.\n\nWhat Privacy Ramifications?\nWhile designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling\npossibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency\nprojects, it also offers much more than just convenience or a 'preferred\ncurrency for payments.'\n\nLet’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a\ncryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy\ntechnology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous\ntransactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions\nusing decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their\ncoins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using\nzero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.\n\nThis is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and\ncons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and\ncosts. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with\nother privacy setups.\n\nLet us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl\nMarketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which\nuses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the\ntransaction using any currency.\n\nNow, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus\ntransaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides\nyou with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send\nthe coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem\ntoken is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to\nbuy the item on the marketplace.\n\nBy this simple act, you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine\nboth Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction, compounding both\nof their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example\nof what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy\ntech.\n\nAgnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace\nAlthough the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in\na truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique\nproperties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer\nfor all Particl Marketplace transactions.\n\nThere are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via\nthe use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace,\nand perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear\nthat the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment\nsystems are limitless.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This division in the community limits our collective capacity to address the imminent challenges to privacy that we previously outlined, a suboptimal outcome given the substantial force wielded by those who seek to undermine our freedoms.</p><p>Ultimately, to stand a chance against this opposition, we should strive to embrace our uniqueness and foster creativity; different projects working on different ideas and solutions, but we must unite together in a decentralized, private, and free economy in which all of our projects thrive and can be integrated.</p><p>To do just that, we are presently focused on a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">comprehensive improvement of our ecosystem codebase</a>, which is designed to reflect our core values. Among them:</p><ul><li>Privacy, obviously.</li><li>Uncompromising decentralization.</li><li>And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies with which our dApps function.</li></ul><p>With an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy projects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This allows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing within an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys extremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.</p><h2 id=\"embodying-agnosticism\">Embodying Agnosticism</h2><p>The Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are currently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing for various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order to power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.</p><p>For instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own native SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our modular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and only request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an SMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.</p><p>Adopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other compatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps. The final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements of their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.</p><p>This not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use cases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to Particl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have worked on.</p><h3 id=\"it-also-makes-them-more-resilient-\">It also makes them more resilient.</h3><p>Consider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable its distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that SMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event. Although such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a minor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an alternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user would lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers fails to act in a timely manner.</p><p>This is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas other projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without competing with each other but without having to start developing together. We could sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples, but I think you get the gist.</p><p>Because technology advances so fast, <strong>we must build solutions that will endure the test of time</strong>. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger, together, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the perfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.</p><p>However, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules. After all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have unique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.</p><p>In our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in which SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl dApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying the different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy and freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.</p><h2 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism </h2><p>Currency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in privacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example: you can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without third-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely different coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so. This introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in order to acquire this specific coin.</p><p>That is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re currently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for other coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end swap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.</p><p>While several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges, can be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal outcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/\">the Changelly debacle</a> within the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a <strong>free, independent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy</strong> without central points of failure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.</p><h3 id=\"what-privacy-ramifications\">What Privacy Ramifications?</h3><p>While designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling possibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency projects, <strong>it also offers much more than just convenience</strong> or a 'preferred currency for payments.'</p><p>Let’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a cryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy technology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous transactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions using decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their coins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using zero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.</p><p>This is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and cons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and costs. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with other privacy setups.</p><p>Let us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl Marketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which uses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the transaction using any currency.</p><p>Now, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus transaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides you with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send the coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem token is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to buy the item on the marketplace.</p><p>By this simple act, <strong>you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine both Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction</strong>, compounding both of their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example of what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy tech.</p><h2 id=\"agnosticism-part-and-the-particl-marketplace\">Agnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace</h2><p>Although the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in a truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique properties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer for all Particl Marketplace transactions.  </p><p>There are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via the use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace, and perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear that the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment systems are limitless.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
