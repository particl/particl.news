Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\n(4:07 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=4m8s]) Is it still the plan to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop.\nYes. We still have big plans for Changelly, and we definitely think they will\nhelp a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide\narray of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also\nprovide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a\nlot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.\n\nAs per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our\nmain wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate Changelly, but also\nany other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several\nother services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services.\nWe believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much\nmore adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing\nthem more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.\n\n(4:07 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&feature=youtu.be&t=4m8s]) Is\nit currently being worked on?\nThe team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl\nMarketplace and the integration is not being actively worked on right now as it\nhasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to\ndiscuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace,\nbut they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that\nmakes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.\n\nDon’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would\nmake this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities,\nthis will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being\ncurrency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.\n\nWe would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently\nbeing worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by\nchecking out our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report/] page on \nparticl.io [http://particl.io].\n\n(10:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s]) Can the team make atomic swaps\nmore user-friendly?\nAs it currently stands today, atomic swaps (the trustless coin exchanging\nprotocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge\nway to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no\neasy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to\ntrade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.\n\nAt Particl more precisely, we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since\nOctober 2017, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so\nfar. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible\nsolutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of \natomic swaps will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone\nwithout advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first\niteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting\nimproved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how\nadvanced and complicated executing atomic swaps currently is though, such an\neasy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on\nmainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two\nsolutions:\n\nDecentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl\n\nIt’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a \ndecentralized exchange based on atomic swaps somewhere in the future. This is\nobviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to\never happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting\nfor the platform.\n\nCheckout Option\n\nHaving the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like\nto use as part of the checkout process might be a more intuitive way to go about\nit. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This\nwould not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a\nreally user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already\ndo online payments.\n\nDecentralized Exchange Integrations\n\nThere are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the\nmeantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on\nChangelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other\ndecentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless\nsolutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books\nand order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized\nthan their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also\npresent themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more\nliquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated\ninto Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of\nsuch middle-ground services could be found in Altcoin.io [http://altcoin.io/] \nand AtomicWallet [https://atomicwallet.io/].\n\n(16:58 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s]) Has the NJIT Department of\nTechnology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number\nof Transactions?\nFor some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy\nprotocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule\nof thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more\nprivate these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue\nfor some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to\ndeal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and RingCT are on parallel\ntracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of\nmarketplace transactions (since they will all default to RingCT) coupled with\nnon-marketplace RingCT cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a\nsolid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other Particl Dapps then start\nto make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of RingCT-based privacy\ncoins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions\n(currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl,\nreal-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy\non the platform.\n\nThat being said, our RingCT implementation has been academically reviewed by the\nNJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the\nprotocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and\nways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced\nwith many potential scenarios.\n\nWe’d also like to reemphasize that privacy, security, and decentralization are\nthree of our core values. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as\nprivate and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and\nwe are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these\nthree core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core\nfeatures.\n\n(22:54 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s]) Is the team looking into other\nprivacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?\nWe are not looking into other privacy schemes, but Tecnovert is currently\nworking on some RingCT improvements he’s been wanting to implement for some time\nnow. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both WSA’s \nsecurity audit and NJIT’s academic review, some minor issues might have\nconvinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we\nproceed with our RingCT + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not\nconstitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements\nour developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside\nreview. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl\nResearch & Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the RingCT scheme\ncould mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a\nring signature + confidential transaction setup (RingCT) but something a bit\ndifferent. These changes will make the RingCT protocol a more private solution\nand one that is potentially cheaper to use.\n\nThe very first commits related to these RingCT improvements have started\nappearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later\ntime. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by\nTecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.\n\nParticl-Core — Commits [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\n\n(26:10 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=26m10s]) Will the team postpone the\nmainnet release of the marketplace in order to make sure Particl’s RingCT\nprivacy is optimal?\nAs mentioned above, privacy is one of our core value and we would not release\nthe marketplace on mainnet until we are fully satisfied with the level of\nprivacy it offers. That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions\nand improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we\nalso believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction\npool.\n\nIt’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency\ntransactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind\nand in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a \nmajor code refactoring of the MAD escrow system which will make it more private \nand again, potentially cheaper to use. Another example of how privacy and\nsecurity are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat\nprice pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from\nCoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also\nleak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive\nobserver could use to start profiling users.\n\nEvery single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at\nits very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the\nprivacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it\ncomes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and\nit is what we are all about!\n\n(28:33 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s]) When is marketing going to\nkick up?\nInternally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace has\nalready started. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to Jira, just like\nour developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile\nmethodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in\nattaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency,\nand we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm\nteam. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our\nbudget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for\nthe launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure\nthat Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.\n\n(35:11 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s]) Did Qiang Tang work on private\nlistings for Particl Marketplace?\nNo, this is not part of what they reviewed.\n\n(35:45 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s]) How much time would it take the\nteam to release private listings on testnet?\nOur team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the\nyear, so working back from that point private listings should be released on\ntestnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of\na feature as RingCT and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part\nof the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta.\nThe marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and\nthe word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to\nimplement.\n\nAs with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the\norder and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on\na multitude of factors.\n\n(37:01 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s]) If the governance mechanism and\nRingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even\nthough all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?\nAs mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the governance\nsystem and RingCT. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet\nrelease, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if\nthey are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.\n\n(38:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s]) Could we at least have one guest\nper AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?\nYes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the\nmarketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of\nour best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be\npossible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our Lead Graphic\nDesigner CRZ.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Released\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Release\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused\non the marketplace, but its wallet…\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\n\nWe released on the 12th of September Particl Desktop 1.2.3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3], a major update\non the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop. A majority of its user\ninterface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly, and a lot\nof bug fixes and stability improvements were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been! Follow the link above to get\nall the details about this update.\n\nStatus Report\nParticl.io — StatusReport [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nWe released on the 14th of September a new Status Report on particl.io\n[http://particl.io]. There are some interesting updates, such as the RingCT\nimplementation (enhancements) and the modification currently being done to the\ngovernance system. In fact, the development team is switching the measurement of\nthe voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a\ntime base. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the\nSettings tab have been moved over to the Review section.\n\nYou may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are\nmentions of code refactoring. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms\nof technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the\npast. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our\ndevelopers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure.\nThis means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the\nParticl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient\nways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a code refactoring.\n\n> The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the\nfactoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves\nnonfunctional attributes of the software. —Wikipedia\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]\nYou can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the\nParticl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as smooth, efficient, \npleasant to use, but most importantly, secure and private as possible.\n\nCold Staking Sneak Peek\n> \nWe published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s cold staking pool. While it\nis still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will\nallow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will\nhave the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins\ncould receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current\nstaking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that\nheavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind\nbased on monetary values.\n\nWe will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.\n\nCommunity Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet\nAs announced in our last Community Update #6\n[https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe], the governance mechanism\nfor the Community Proposals as seen its first iteration make its way onto\ntestnet. We have now released proper builds to test the feature and anyone in\nthe community can now fire up their testnet Particl Desktop client and test the\nnew feature. We highly suggest that you report any issue you encounter during\nyour testing either in our #testing channel on Discord/Telegram or directly on \nGithub [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] as that helps us fix\nthem more quickly.\n\nNote 1: The marketplace currently does not include any governance tool. The\ngovernance mechanism has only been fully integrated into Community Proposals.\nThe marketplace integration of this mechanism is currently underway and will\ncome in a later update.\n\nNote 2: The testnet is currently on hold and not loading properly. This has to\ndo with the upgrade to the new 0.17 codebase. Our developer team is working on\nfixing the issue and we will publish new builds as soon as it is operational\nagain!\n\nNew Particl Swag Available on Particl Marketplace Alpha\nICOsensei Custom Particl Label Pins Now Available on Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.news/icosensei-custom-particl-lapel-pins-now-available-in-particl-marketplace-7293f43c29d6]\nWith lots of new features recently released for testing, we thought we’d give\nyou a good reason to come play!\n[https://particl.news/icosensei-custom-particl-lapel-pins-now-available-in-particl-marketplace-7293f43c29d6]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/icosensei-custom-particl-lapel-pins-now-available-in-particl-marketplace-7293f43c29d6]\n\nTo celebrate the Community Proposals feature hitting testnet and to show off the\nenhancements made to the testnet version of Particl Marketplace, we’ve decided\nto make available free Particl pins from our friends over at ICOSensei\n[https://www.icosensei.com/].

In fact,\nthis widely-used mobile application has developed a way for cryptocurrency teams\nto push notifications to their users. This feature, of course, did not launch\nwith every single cryptocurrency at once, and we had been in the “waiting list”\nfor quite some time. We finally had the opportunity to be added and have started\npushing important notifications using the platform.

We still have big plans for <strong>Changelly</strong>, and we definitely think they will help a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide array of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also provide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a lot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.</p><p>As per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our main wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate <strong>Changelly</strong>, but also any other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate Changelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several other services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services. We believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much more adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing them more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.</p><h3 id=\"-4-07-is-it-currently-being-worked-on\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m8s\">4:07</a>) Is it currently being worked on?</h3><p>The team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace and <strong>the integration is not being actively worked on right now</strong> as it hasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to discuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace, but they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that makes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.</p><p>Don’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would make this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities, this will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being currency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.</p><p>We would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently being worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by checking out our <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-10-14-can-the-team-make-atomic-swaps-more-user-friendly\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>) Can the team make atomic swaps more user-friendly?</h3><p>As it currently stands today, <strong>atomic swaps</strong> (the trustless coin exchanging protocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge way to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &amp; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop.

Follow the link above to get all the details about this update.</p><h3 id=\"status-report\">Status Report</h3><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — StatusReport</strong></a><br><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><em>Particl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy * Private…</em></a><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p>We released on the 14th of September a new Status Report on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>. There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

We still have big plans for <strong>Changelly</strong>, and we definitely think they will help a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide array of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also provide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a lot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.</p><p>As per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our main wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate <strong>Changelly</strong>, but also any other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate Changelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several other services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services. We believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much more adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing them more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.</p><h3 id=\"-4-07-is-it-currently-being-worked-on\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=4m8s\">4:07</a>) Is it currently being worked on?</h3><p>The team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace and <strong>the integration is not being actively worked on right now</strong> as it hasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to discuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace, but they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that makes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.</p><p>Don’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would make this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities, this will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being currency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.</p><p>We would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently being worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by checking out our <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-10-14-can-the-team-make-atomic-swaps-more-user-friendly\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>) Can the team make atomic swaps more user-friendly?</h3><p>As it currently stands today, <strong>atomic swaps</strong> (the trustless coin exchanging protocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge way to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &#x26; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop.

There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system.

Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies.
