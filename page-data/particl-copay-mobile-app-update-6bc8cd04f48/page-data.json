This development update will explain in more details what is being\nworked into Particl Copay and what can be expected from the next few versions of\nParticl’s mobile application.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMobile Cold Staking\nOne of the big feature being coded into Particl Copay is the long-awaited cold\nstaking capabilities. In fact, it will soon be possible to connect your funds to\na cold staking node directly from your mobile application and help secure the\nnetwork while growing your PART stash at the same time. Note that, in this case,\nthe Particl Copay mobile wallet won’t be the device actually staking. The update\nwill only enable the possibility to cold stake your funds held on Particl Copay\nby delegating its staking power to a cold staking node.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nWhat if Particl’s Proof-of-Stake algorithm could be taken yet to another level?\nThis is what this next feature is going to do! Not only will Particl Copay’s\ncold staking update introduce the ability to connect your mobile wallet to a\ncold staking node, but it will also introduce multi-signature\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions] \ncold staking. This will allow you to stake your funds held in multi-sig\naddresses, requiring you to have access to more than one device to successfully\nauthorize and execute a transaction.\n\nFor the time being, this will only be compatible with Copay devices. This may or\nmay not change in the future, although the team has already identified ways to\nmake it compatible with Ledger hardware devices. As this feature requires a\nhardfork, it won’t be included in the next update of Particl Copay.\n\niOS Support\nAnother long-awaited feature for Particl’s mobile wallet is official support for\niOS. As many of you know, especially iPhone users, Particl Copay hasn’t been\navailable on iOS since its inception, but that’s about to change! The mobile\napplication has already started to see its code being upgraded\n[https://github.com/particl/copay/commits/master] to be compatible with iOS and,\nat that point, we are only waiting for Apple to confirm Particl’s Apple\nDeveloper Account. When that’s done, we’ll be able to publish the application on\nthe App Store whenever the update is ready to go live! This compatibility update\nshould be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nMulti-Currency Support\nA very useful feature that’s gonna be included in the next update is the ability\nto hold different coins in Particl Copay without having to use multiple wallet\napplications. Indeed, once the update goes live, Particl Copay will have support\nfor Particl, but also Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This should prove very useful\nwhenever Particl’s Open Marketplace starts accepting Bitcoin payments! This\nupdate will be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nUI/UX Improvement\nThose of you already using Particl Copay will notice it right away, this update\nwill introduce several UI/UX improvements all over the app. There is not much to\nsay about this in particular other than the fact that the mobile application has\nbeen improved visually and will offer all of its new features within a very\nuser-friendly and intuitive environment. This update will be available in the\nnext version of Particl Copay.\n\nNotifications\nVarious types of notifications will also be introduced in this update. Whether\nit be incoming or outgoing transactions, staking rewards, or multi-sig\ntransaction requests, the mobile app will now notify you whenever something\nhappens within the app. This update will be available in the next version of\nParticl Copay.\n\nCopay Wallet Emptying Vulnerability Fix\nWhile the current version of Particl Copay isn’t affected by the newly\ndiscovered exploit\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitpays-copay-wallet-compromised-by-malicious-code-firm-issues-advice-for-users] \nthat allowed attackers to empty Bitcoin Copay wallets due to a faulty Node.js\nmodule, this exploit has been revealed to be effective on recent versions of\nBitcoin Copay. This critical vulnerability will be fixed and not be present in\nthe new Particl Copay version.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this new Particl Copay update.\nThis will bring much needed and requested features to the mobile application and\nreally make this wallet a powerful tool both in terms of utility and security.\nSince this is just a development update and not a proper announcement blog post,\nwe recommend you to watch the developments being made to the mobile application\nby going on its Github repository [http://github.com/particl/copay], or to\nsimply keep an eye on our blog [http://particl.news] for any future release\nannouncement.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to see more development updates?

They used\nthis opportunity to record an AMA/FAQ session to answer some of the questions\nthat have been asked on Reddit.\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/a0lbbf/amafaq_with_special_guest_lina_seiche_recording/]\n\nDue to limited time and the unusually high amount of questions received for this\nAMA/FAQ, the team couldn’t answer all the questions while in Toronto but did so\nin the Reddit thread itself. For the purpose of this Community Update, we’ve\ncompiled all the answers, including those answered in the video.\n\n> Video Questions\n(3:01 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=181]) Can we expect in-client messaging\nfor the main net?\nIn-client messaging will be a new feature introduced into the marketplace as we\nwork towards a fully loaded main release. We have a bunch of new features queued\nup on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll\nbe released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will\nbe different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the\nteam will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent\nand exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being\nconsidered/worked on by reading the South Africa development update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11] posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nQ&A Communications on Listing PagesWe do see in-client messaging integrated into\nthe shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of\nthis can be seen in a gif posted on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323] by our UI/UX and\nfront-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a\nseller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users)\ndirectly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&A format used on\nAmazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.\n\nAnother messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group\nchats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a\nstand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities,\nespecially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned \n/r/beertrade Reddit community [https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade]) directly\nwithin Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications.\nThis would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your\nday-to-day life.\n\n(3:49 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229]) Will there be a Decentralized\nExchange integration?\nThe team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration\nat this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team,\nfeel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will\nget some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace\nintegrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a\nreality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a\nChangelly or a similar third-party integration.\n\nWhile a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it\ndoesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the\nParticl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the\nshort-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and\nthat integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the\nvolume.\n\nExample of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)As such, we are\nactively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when\none of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then\nwe might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and\nthen integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d\nkeep the community in the know about any development on that front!\n\n(4:27 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284]) Moving forward, what role will\nMiguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?\nAll of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl.\nMost of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own\ncircles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s\nlatest videos that have been posted on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg] as well as in \nDeutsche Welle’s documentary [https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94] he and Lina Seiche\nwere featured on last month.\n\nDW’s Documentary:\n\nMeeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:\n\nHumans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:\n\nTo date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with\nagendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in\n2019, as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet, we’ll definitely be engaging each of\nour advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social\nmedia, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a\nvery different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production\nphase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of\ntremendous help.\n\nWith Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage\nmore with our advisors from SCI [http://sci.ph], Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon,\nand you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.\n\n(6:22 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382]) Can we expect a fiat gateway\nintegration into the Particl client?\nWe know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is,\nafter all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as\npossible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve\nthis, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one\nof our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of\npayment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream\ntype of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways\n\nWe need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We\nhave looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as\nIndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of\nprivacy and security.\n\nFor the time being, we know Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/] plans on tackling that\naspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!\n\n(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?\nOur legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are\nconstantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to\nplay by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are\nfully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal\nteam stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations.\nCompliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully\nintend on staying that way moving forward.\n\n(8:23 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503]) How will atomic swaps be\nincorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nExample of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)There are mostly\ntwo UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic\nswaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one\npath. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent\nof the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An\nimplementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps\nsince it would live independently of the marketplace.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n(9:05 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545]) What does Lina consider to be the\nmost exciting aspect about Particl?\nParaphrased from Lina:\n\n> I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting\nthings I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is\nobviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get\nacquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the\nhype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while\nand they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to\npush good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the\ncryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other\nprojects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one\nof the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an\nactual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about\nrevolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in\nthis bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you\nfind yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering,\nand that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about\nthe project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!\n\nParaphrased from Paul:\n\n> Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing\nParticl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are\npretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working\nproduct, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are\nstill stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for\ntheir talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well\nreceived in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working\nblockchain product.\n(11:58 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718]) Can you give us a brief summary of\nyour week in South Africa?\nWe have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa\ndevelopment meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nAside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of\nthe meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be\nimproved.\n\nAmong the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy\nfor Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into\ntwo branches: dev and stable. The dev branch will be the “experimental” one\nwhere new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break\nstuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very\nhelpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a stable branch comes\nin handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been\nproperly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration\nand testing purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during\nAlpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time,\neach development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring\nmore frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring\nfor testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation,\nprivacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about\ndeveloping the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new\nfeatures, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to\nbe added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of\ndevelopment to be very exciting for everyone!\n\nWe’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also finally\nrelease Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet. We’re currently in the last mile\nbefore our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious\nmilestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the\ncurrent Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes\nlive on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha\nversion of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.\n\nAnother topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was\nour decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and\nboots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement\nwe’ve made in December that we’d be attending Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event,\nTOKEN2049.\n\nParticl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nDirectly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at\nmore conferences around the world…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\n\n(15:01 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901]) Is there going to be a meetup\nin France?\nYes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ \nCoinHouse [https://www.coinhouse.com/] late in February. CoinHouse is the\nleading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France\n[https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php] \nwith over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It\noffers a wide array of services including educational information, investment\nadvice\n[https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686] \n (approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part\nof their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very\npopular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by\nthe France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the\nnow widely-known and popular startup Ledger [http://ledger.com], which now have\na product (Ledger Nano S) that is compatible with Particl for hardware storage\nand cold staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\nCoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities HEC\n[http://www.hec.edu/] and Polytechnique [https://www.polytechnique.edu/] and now\noffers blockchain classes to students.\n\nLa Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nLeading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nmedium.com\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\n\nThis event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team\nmembers, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from\nMubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.\n\n(16:52 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012]) Will there be another\nPARTaker Hub?\nWe have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into\nseveral ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in\ntime, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term\ngoal.\n\n(17:44 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064]) Will there be a coin weight\nfeature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a\ncompetitor) from the market?\nIt shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of\ngovernance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing\nseveral rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release\nand part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial\ngovernance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against\nabuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring\nhow the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready\nto make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not\nthe first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is\na hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet\nmodel perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve\nas we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!\n\n(18:32 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112])— What added value could SCI\nprovide for Particl?\nSimilarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging\nthe founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project,\nmuch more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the\nproject, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year,\ntheir expertise and network could become very handy.\n\nSCI - Home [https://sci.ph/]\nSatoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology\ncompany\nbuilding the Blockchain ecosystem in… [https://sci.ph/]sci.ph [https://sci.ph/]\n\nSatoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies\nin the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well\nreputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even\nadvise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing\nlots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their\ninfluence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.\n\n> Other Questions\nWhat’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?\nThe biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX\ngenesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in\ntime. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that\ndecentralized exchange.\n\nWhat about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?\nWe’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social\njuggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will\nbegin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter,\nYouTube, and Instagram in 2019.\n\nBoth Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own\nsocial calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of\neach other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are\ncryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream\nonline buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary\nfeatures required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.\n\nWhat about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed\nand if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?\nLarge-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release\ncontaining all the planned features that define that release. It could even be\nlater than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to\nmore “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than\nBeta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to\nwork on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our\nadoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest\nassured, these are absolutely planned.\n\nFor this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in\nniche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or\ncertain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies.\nIn other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more\nlimited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering\nthe most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will\nbenefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee,\ncensorship-proof, privacy, etc).\n\nAs Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new\nfeatures that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added.\nWhether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation,\neach new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a\nwider audience.\n\nWe already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly\nbenefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the\nmarketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so\nthese will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be\nable to accommodate their businesses.\n\nDo we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the\nbeta be testnet or mainnet?\nWe don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the\nmainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before\nthe end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working\non a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the\nhardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can\nbe included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.\n\nRegarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to\nmake a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our\ntesters have been helping within the community since May. So instead of\nreleasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product\nour Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha\nversion will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and\nwill mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.\n\nAdditionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability,\nit will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable\ntestnet builds to everyone and have a select and limited group of users running\nthe mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to\neveryone!\n\nFollowing the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin\nworking on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace\nrelease — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move\nour Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.\n\nBeta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for\nMarch 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t\nconstitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up\nto that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will\nfeature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the\nteam was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on\npopping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting\nstage of development for the community than Alpha was.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nWhen and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?\nThe team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It\nis really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl\nFoundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round\nto those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with\nthe Foundation itself.\n\nHow much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and\nwhen can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?\nA mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input\nat this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have\nwhen we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current\ntasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the\nmarketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.\n\nInterview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nOn the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert\nEdwards. I’ve had the chance to have several…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\n\nOn a related note, Particl Copay has a new senior developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nbringing it up-to-date and adding more features, such as the ability to hold\nother coins on the wallet itself (i.e. Bitcoin). Another update to the mobile\nwallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS\nintegration (currently being looked into).\n\nAre you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?\nWe’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being\ndeveloped as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be\nattached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules\nwill be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release\nof a new roadmap for the moment.\n\nWhat kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target\nmainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?\nWithout a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target\nmainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot\nwon’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some\nusers will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new\nfeature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online\nshoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase\nof many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream\nusers and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe\ndecentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit\nalmost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized\nmarketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.\n\nIt is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless\nsolution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any\nthird-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on\nany partner.\n\nWhen is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?\nDesktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is\ncurrently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently\ncompatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later\ntime — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.\n\nWhat is your marketing plan for 2019?\nSimilar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl\nProject and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in\nslightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.\n\nWith the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not\nincrease our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We\nwill promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news\ndoesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep\nthe marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.\n\nTo that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and\nmeetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of\nthe only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an\neffective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the\nproject moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people\nthat were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that\nremain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in\nthe tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the\nworld. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we\nare working towards making these real-life connections.\n\nSimilarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off\nemployees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl\nthough, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope\nwill end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our\nproducts.\n\nNote that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.\n\nAre we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?\nThis is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s\nentirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART,\nbut we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to\nensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require.\nWe strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized\nas a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise\nand the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working\non something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it\ncurrently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an\nactual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the\nproject and the talent of our developers.\n\nWhat are the other Dapps planned for Particl?\nThe team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each\nperson has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a\nyet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the\nMarketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp\nitself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the\ndeveloper SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start\nseeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their\nown Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal\n“dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are\nsome thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus\nfor now if we want it to release in a timely manner.\n\nAbout Particl.page [http://Particl.page], what is this website, what are\ntheir goals?\nParticl Page [https://particl.page]\nCommunity is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise. We want to\nstimulate a nice, friendly community around… [https://particl.page]particl.page\n[https://particl.page]\n\nIt’s an awesome community run website! They now have made a cold staking pool\navailable for their users, but as the website isn’t run by the team itself, we\ncannot say what other plans they have. They are somewhat active on Riot so don’t\nbe shy asking questions directly to them! (Riot user: @particl.page:matrix.org)\n\nDo we have other partners ready to handle the volatility of the escrow, the\ndouble deposits and which will allow mainstream users to pay in fiat using\nparticl in the background except for Mubiz? If it is not the case what is going\nto be done to have a worldwide coverage of partners ready to give Particl access\nto mainstream users?\nNothing as of yet. This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with\neverything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the\nteam is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be\nsometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version\nof the marketplace is planned.\n\nDo you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their\ntrade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be\nmade to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and\nquantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been\nmade already?\nNo studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party\nregarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good\nstudy to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement\nand can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.\n\nI think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.\nWe’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and\n“Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private\nmarkets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large\nbubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the\nprivate markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll\nprobably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions.

They used this opportunity to record an AMA/FAQ session to answer some of the questions that have been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/a0lbbf/amafaq_with_special_guest_lina_seiche_recording/\"><strong>asked on Reddit.</strong></a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uiefPZl6IEw?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Due to limited time and the unusually high amount of questions received for this AMA/FAQ, the team couldn’t answer all the questions while in Toronto but did so in the Reddit thread itself. For the purpose of this Community Update, we’ve compiled all the answers, including those answered in the video.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Video Questions</strong></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"-3-01-can-we-expect-in-client-messaging-for-the-main-net\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=181\">3:01</a>) Can we expect in-client messaging for the main net?</h3><p>In-client messaging will be a new feature introduced into the marketplace as we work towards a fully loaded main release. We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Q&A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&amp;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications. This would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your day-to-day life.</p><h3 id=\"-3-49-will-there-be-a-decentralized-exchange-integration\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229\">3:49</a>) Will there be a Decentralized Exchange integration?</h3><p>The team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration at this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d keep the community in the know about any development on that front!</p><h3 id=\"-4-27-moving-forward-what-role-will-miguel-cuneta-and-john-bailon-play-in-particl\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284\">(4:27</a>) Moving forward, what role will Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?</h3><p>All of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl. Most of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own circles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It offers a wide array of services including educational information, <a href=\"https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686\"><strong>investment advice</strong></a><strong> </strong>(approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part of their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very popular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by the France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the now widely-known and popular startup <a href=\"http://ledger.com\"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, which now have a product (Ledger Nano S) that is <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>compatible with Particl for hardware storage and cold staking</strong></a>. CoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities <a href=\"http://www.hec.edu/\"><strong>HEC</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.polytechnique.edu/\"><strong>Polytechnique</strong></a><strong> </strong>and now offers blockchain classes to students.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><strong>La Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><em>Leading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\">medium.com</a></p><p>This event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team members, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from Mubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.</p><h3 id=\"-16-52-will-there-be-another-partaker-hub\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012\">16:52</a>) Will there be another PARTaker Hub?</h3><p>We have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines.

They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even advise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing lots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their influence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.</p><blockquote><strong>Other Questions</strong></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-s-happening-with-the-particl-pivx-alliance\"><em>What’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?</em></h3><p>The biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX genesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in time.

How will this evolve with mainnet?</em></h3><p>We’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social juggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It is really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl Foundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round to those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with the Foundation itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-much-time-will-be-needed-to-release-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-and-when-can-we-expect-a-particl-copay-wallet-on-ios\"><em>How much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and when can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?</em></h3><p>A mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input at this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Another update to the mobile wallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS integration (currently being looked into).</p><h3 id=\"are-you-going-to-release-a-roadmap-with-a-timeline\"><em>Are you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?</em></h3><p>We’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being developed as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise.

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace?

It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the developer SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to the whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and marketplace features on Particl.</p><hr><p>This concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Q&#x26;A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&#x26;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications.

A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform.

A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It offers a wide array of services including educational information, <a href=\"https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686\"><strong>investment advice</strong></a><strong> </strong>(approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part of their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very popular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by the France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the now widely-known and popular startup <a href=\"http://ledger.com\"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, which now have a product (Ledger Nano S) that is <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>compatible with Particl for hardware storage and cold staking</strong></a>. CoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities <a href=\"http://www.hec.edu/\"><strong>HEC</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.polytechnique.edu/\"><strong>Polytechnique</strong></a><strong> </strong>and now offers blockchain classes to students.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><strong>La Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><em>Leading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\">medium.com</a></p><p>This event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team members, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from Mubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.</p><h3 id=\"-16-52-will-there-be-another-partaker-hub\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012\">16:52</a>) Will there be another PARTaker Hub?</h3><p>We have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well reputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even advise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing lots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their influence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.</p><blockquote><strong>Other Questions</strong></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-s-happening-with-the-particl-pivx-alliance\"><em>What’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?</em></h3><p>The biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX genesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in time. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that decentralized exchange.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-social-media-strategy-how-will-this-evolve-with-mainnet\"><em>What about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?</em></h3><p>We’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social juggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It is really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl Foundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round to those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with the Foundation itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-much-time-will-be-needed-to-release-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-and-when-can-we-expect-a-particl-copay-wallet-on-ios\"><em>How much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and when can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?</em></h3><p>A mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input at this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Another update to the mobile wallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS integration (currently being looked into).</p><h3 id=\"are-you-going-to-release-a-roadmap-with-a-timeline\"><em>Are you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?</em></h3><p>We’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being developed as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise.

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be made to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and quantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been made already?</em></h3><p>No studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party regarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the developer SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to the whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and marketplace features on Particl.</p><hr><p>This concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
