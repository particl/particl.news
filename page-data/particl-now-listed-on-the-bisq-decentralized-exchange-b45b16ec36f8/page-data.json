This update\nincludes all the latest Open Marketplace improvements as well as two new\nmarketplace features: Question & Answers and Product Imports.\n\nQuestions & Answers: This feature allows you to ask and answer questions on a\nlisted item. The questions can be answered by anyone else as well as the seller\nof the item. When a seller replies to a question, it is marked with a special\ndesignation so that it is obvious that it is the seller’s answer to the\nquestion. The feature isn’t unlike Amazon’s very popular Q&A section on each\nlisted item’s page. This first version of the Q&A implementation does not\ncurrently include a notification system, but it will be part of a further\nupdate. A notification system for questions is already being worked on.\n\nQuestions & AnswersProduct Imports: This feature allows you to import products and inventories from\noutside sources. Its first version will allow the importation of products from\nWooCommerce stores as well as from .csv (spreadsheet) files. This tool is\ndesigned to make it easier for sellers who are already selling online and those\nwith large inventories to import and list their products more quickly. As all\nlistings used to need to be added manually, one by one, this feature is going to\nsave sellers a ton of time.\n\nProduct Imports\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 2.0.2: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.1.0\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.1.0]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

Follow \nthis tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4] to\nlearn how to install and use it so that you can safely cold stake your funds.\nPrivate Cold Staking V1.0Download: https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking\n\nGBen1/Private-Coldstaking [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\nThis script allows you to anonymize automatically your coldstaking rewards on\nyour node and to redirect them… [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\n\nTo install directly on your staking node, type the following commands:\n\ncd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n\ncd Private-Coldstaking && bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n\nPPoS — A Security-Focused Proof-of-Stake Protocol\nParticl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) is Particl’s very own and super secure\nProof-of-Stake algorithm. In fact, it is one of the most secure PoS algorithms\nin the blockchain space due to its cold staking capabilities.\n\nFor those not familiar with it, cold staking allows you to delegate the staking\nweight of your funds to a node which contains no coin, meaning that the wallet\nthat actually holds the coins can be taken offline and still contribute to\nsecuring the Particl network (and receive staking rewards for it). What makes\nthe cold staking capabilities of PPoS even more secure is the fact that it can\nbe used in combination with a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S device, for\nexample, bringing its level of security to an absurdly high level.\n\nOne thing Particl Proof-of-Stake does not do, however, is private/stealth\nstaking. In other words, you can only stake funds held in public balances, but\nnot in blind or anon balances. But considering the great privacy protocols\navailable on the Particl network (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT),\nthere really shouldn’t be any reason why staking privately shouldn’t be\npossible.\n\nWhy isn’t PPoS Private by Default in the First Place?\nAs the previous section of this blog post mentions, PPoS is a security-focused\nProof-of-Stake protocol, meaning security comes first before anything else.\nAfter all, PoS protocols are what’s responsible for the verification of\ntransactions and the creation of coins on the network. If something goes wrong\nhere, it can spell a lot of troubles for the chain.\n\nThe main issue with a fully private Proof-of-Stake protocol is auditability. In\nfact, while it could be proven without a doubt that the inflation model is fine\n(you can prove the right amount of coins is being created at the right time, and\nyou can detect if an exploit if being used to create a fraudulent amount of\ncoins at the inflation level), it’s not possible, however, to detect some edge\ncases where an attacker would be able to create coins out of thin air without\nissuing them through the usual inflation process.\n\nNote that Proof-of-Work coins with a “private by default” approach to mining,\nsuch as Monero, are also vulnerable to this issue. This isn’t a vulnerability\nthat is exclusive to Proof-of-Stake. At this point, there has been a few\ninstances of inflation-related attacks, notably in regards to the Zerocoin\nprotocol\n[https://cryptoslate.com/zerocoin-exploit-found-zcoin-attacked-other-privacy-coins-at-risk/] \n(Zerocoin, PIVX, Veil, etc) which had to be disabled on the affected coins.\nThere has been a similar bug on Monero and some of its forks\n[https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html] \nwhich would have allowed an attacker to create an unlimited amount of coins\nwithout ever being able to detect it. Luckily, this has never been exploited and\nthe bug has been fixed a long time before. Imagine thousands upon thousands of\ncoins being generated out of thin air without anyone being able to detect it…\n\nMaking Cold Staking Private Without the Security Concessions\n)But, again, considering the great privacy protocols available on the Particl\nnetwork (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT), there really shouldn’t be\nany reason why staking privately shouldn’t be possible. And this is where the\nPrivate Cold Staking script comes into action.\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script is a script coded by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. It allows you to automatically anonymize your\nstaking rewards using RingCT. This means you can now safely cold stake your\ncoins and remain anonymous on the network.\n\nBecause the script doesn’t operate at the protocol level, it can provide a very\npowerful level of privacy without compromising on the security side of things.\nTo be clear, with this script, Particl Proof-of-Stake remains untouched. The\nprivacy aspect of things is granted by the Private Cold Staking script itself.\n\nWhat it Can and Can’t Do\nThe Private Cold Staking script is intended to be used as a companion tool to\nthe Partyman cold staking app. It has to be used directly on your cold staking\nnode and uses entropy to obfuscate patterns\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md], thus\nincreasing the level of privacy. This script allows you to do three things:\n\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a public\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a blind (CT)\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to an anon (RingCT\n   ) address of your choice\n\nThe Private Cold Staking cannot, however, stake funds held on stealth addresses\n(blind or anon balances).\n\n> Note: Due to the nature of the script, a few coins will be held on your cold\nstaking node for a small amount of time (under 24 hours). It is not recommended\nto use this script if your staking environment isn’t safe (i.e. shared computer,\nuntrustworthy VPS, etc).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Private Cold Staking Script\n * Download the script on your cold staking node\n   cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n * Navigate to the script’s directory\n   cd Private-Coldstaking/\n * Execute the script and go through the setup process\n   bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n * Make sure everything is set up properly\n   bash update.sh\n * If you wish to uninstall the script, run the uninstaller\n   bash uninstall.sh\n\nFor more information, refer directly to the script’s README file\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md] on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script takes Particl Proof-of-Stake to the next level\nby enabling solid privacy options without sacrificing any of its security. It is\ndirectly in line with Particl’s commitment to both security and privacy. Since\nit will create more anon outputs that can then be used by the network to better\nanonymize other RingCT transactions, it directly contributes to improving the\noverall privacy of the network.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Time to protect your finances and reclaim your\nprivacy! ?","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Private-Cold-Staking-Script-Released/1-zeOzkM2eQLG3Nsd6TbzY_w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"anonymizing-your-staking-rewards-with-ringct-\">Anonymizing Your Staking Rewards With RingCT ?</h3><p>Particl is proud to announce the release of a private cold staking script on Github.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop. Here’s one!\n\nTake note that this mock up is purely a work-in-progress and would most\ndefinitely look a bit different when it’ll be ready for release. It does,\nhowever, gives a good visual representation of how it may look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis news announcement is only part of some more major announcements coming\nsoon. Yes, it’s been a long road to the launch of V3, but it’s given the time\nfor the Particl team to prepare very exciting stuff for the “after-V3” era.\n\nStay tuned, the best is yet to come!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Monero-and-Particl-Atomic-Swaps/1-lx6zvR-f6pN7G9RmKx9otw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"swap-part-and-xmr-on-mainnet-without-any-3rd-party-\">Swap PART and XMR on Mainnet Without Any 3rd Party ?</h3><p>As we head towards the long-awaited <a href=\"https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813\"><strong>Particl V3 release</strong></a>, the Particl developers have been wrapping up the last few pieces required for its launch.</p><p>Particl V3 is Particl’s biggest update to date and it introduces a brand new desktop application as well as greatly improved marketplace experience.
