Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for the biggest event of the year in\ncrypto: the NYC Blockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events]. There, \nthey will finally reveal the Open Marketplace on the real Particl network, the\nmainnet, for the first time ever!\n\nAnd that Open Marketplace is not “just another marketplace”, it is a world\nfirst: a decentralized marketplace, fully autonomous and private, for a new\ncustomer and seller experience\n\nIf you don’t know about it, let us present it to you!\n\nIn this blog post, we will tell you about:\n\n * The Particl Open Marketplace\n * The NYC Blockchain Week\n * The road to the marketplace & how we got there\n * The current state of development, and more\n\nWhat’s the Particl Open Marketplace?\nSimply put, the Open Marketplace is an entirely decentralized marketplace where\nyou can buy and sell products and services to anyone else in the world, in full\nprivacy. Think Alibaba or eBay, but on the blockchain and without a company\nbeing in control of the platform. This means there is no risk of a third party\nusing its position of power to spy on you and impose its arbitrary rules and\nfees.\n\nThe marketplace is fully autonomous, meaning that it doesn’t require any\nthird-party or intermediary to function. It instead restores the balance of\npower back to the people by using a combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer\ntechnologies. The absence of intermediaries alone is enough to bring the cost of\nselling on the platform to a near-zero level.\n\nThis means both vendors and buyers end up with more money in their pockets.\nBecause vendors make more profit per sale, they can reduce their prices to\nincrease their volume and beat the competition. This, in turn, means customers\ncan potentially gain access to cheaper products!\n\nThe Particl Open Marketplace also utilizes a combination of various security\nmeasures and privacy protocols to ensure that none of your data can be accessed\nby anyone. It is a “private by default” marketplace, meaning that you don’t need\nto take any extra step in order to protect your data — it’s just the way Particl\nis.\n\nParticl at the NYC Blockchain Week\nThe NYC Blockchain Week is a series of many crypto events happening within the\nsame timeframe in New York. It attracts the biggest names in the industry,\nshowcases the best blockchain projects, and unites the many different crypto\ncommunities together for one exciting week. In a way, the NYC Blockchain Week is\nto crypto what the World Cup is to football.\n\nParticl in NYC\nParticl is, of course, going to be a part of this event. In fact, you’ll be able\nto come to meet us, right at our booth, at either Magical Crypto Conference or \nConsensus. That’s right! We’ll be having a booth at the two best conferences NYC\nBlockchain Week 2019 has to offer and we’ll be demonstrating the Particl Open\nMarketplace, in exclusivity, on mainnet!\n\nMagical Crypto Conference (MCC)—11th & 12th of May\nThe Magical Crypto Conference [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/] is a\npure crypto-community conference. It is organized and hosted by the well known\n“Magical Crypto Friends”, a group of 4 influencers in the crypto space: Charlie\nLee (Litecoin), Samson Mow (Blockstream CSO), Ricardo Spagni (Monero), and\n“WhalePanda”\n\nThis is the perfect place to meet potential Open Marketplace users and is the\nreason why we are so excited to be having a booth at this event. In fact, as MCC\nis more of a pure crypto community conference, it attracts some of the crypto\npioneers and people that are already deeply interested by the true vision of\ncryptocurrencies, privacy, decentralization, and personal freedom. A simple look\nat the speaker list [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#speakers] should\ngive you a good idea of the type of people that will attend the event.\n\nConsensus by Coindesk—13th to the 15th of May\nStarted by Coindesk in 2015, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] is one of the first crypto\nconference ever and the most prestigious. It has become the biggest\ncryptocurrency event in the world and is a place where people mean business.\n\nThis will be the ideal place to meet various people from different areas of\nexpertise — media, marketing, law, vendors, suppliers, influencers, and, of\ncourse, crypto fans. Such a varied crowd of people is sure to have a lot of\ndifferent feedback about the Open Marketplace, and we are really excited to see\nthe reaction of these people when faced with a modern blockchain product, on\nmainnet.\n\nHaving a good chunk of the team at Consensus will also be ideal to meet people,\ncraft new relationships, and grow the amount of interest for the Particl\necosystem.\n\nMeet the Team\nThe Particl team is going to be 10 member/representative strong going into these\nconferences.\n\n * Juha (Ludx) — Lead Open Marketplace Developer\n * Gerlof van Ek (Crz) — Lead Designer & Branding, UI/UX, Developer\n * Paul Schmitzer (Litebit) — Project Marketing & Strategy\n * Imran (Imyb) — Commercial & Partner Strategy\n * Cryptoguard — Communications & Strategy\n * Gloria (Katelady) — Communications & Strategy\n * Joe Fisher — eCommerce Strategy (Particl Advisor)\n * Lina Seiche — Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist\n * Desi-Rae Campbell (Cryptoramble) — Education & Awareness\n * Joskye — Education & Awareness\n\nCome to our booth at either MCC or Consensus and have a chat with us. We’ll be\ngiving out PART paper wallets, shirts/hoodies, webcam covers, stickers, pins,\nand, most importantly, you’ll be able to test the Particl Open Marketplace live\non mainnet for the first time ever!\n\nIn the meantime, our other developers are hard at work, as per usual, preparing\nthe final build of the Open Marketplace so that it can be publicly released on\nmainnet.\n\nThe Open Marketplace — 2 Great Years of Development\nThe Open Marketplace is quite something to see. It is a complex combination of\npeer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy\nprotocols. It’s also never been attempted before, most of the development toward\nthe marketplace being true pioneering work. It supports a decentralized and\nprivate cryptocurrency, an entirely decentralized escrow mechanism,\ndecentralized file hosting, metadata leak prevention, and etc.\n\nTo see all of the components and features of the Open Marketplace, read our\nPrivacy in eCommerce blog post by following this link: \nhttps://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155\n\nIt has been under heavy and constant development for nearly two years. Almost\nexactly one year ago, Particl released its first proof-of-concept on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, although with a much more basic version of what it has now become. At the\ntime, a simple buy and sell flow was available, without moderation tools,\nwithout proposals, and without a user interface that’s as stable and\nuser-friendly as it is today.\n\nAll this time, throughout the cold crypto winter, the Particl team has been \nhard\nat work [https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9] to\ndeliver its long-anticipated Open Marketplace on mainnet. This much is evidenced\nnot only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on Github\n[http://github.com/particl] but by the very noticeable progress being made on\nthe Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl\nproject has found itself being ranked high in almost all development-related\nrankings of blockchain projects\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAnd here we are, in New York City, presenting the Particl Open Marketplace live\non the main network for the first time ever!\n\nWhat’s next?\nAfter 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is\nnearly over ?\n\nStarting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain,\nParticl created a first:\n\n→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is\nthought of with maximum privacy and security in mind. Everything on Particl is\nprivate, from its untraceable currency to its marketplace, without forgetting\nits proposal, escrow, messaging, file hosting systems, and more.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning, a lot will come after the release of the Open\nMarketplace on mainnet:\n\n * Advanced Open Marketplace features: secure messaging, privacy transactions,\n   inventory management, in-client package tracking, review system, fiat price\n   pegging, and etc.\n * “Marketplace Bubbles” : your own private market on the particl network!\n * CT Bulletproofs, while still being tested on the test network, will improve\n   drastically the size of privacy transactions for any trades of the network.\n   Don’t forget that Particl uses RingCT technology (on testnet), a first on the\n   Bitcoin codebase!\n * Particl Lightning Network (our first testnet transaction just happened a few\n   days ago\n   [https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n   ) and Atomic Swap, so that anyone can change its Bitcoins, Litecoins,\n   Moneros, and more on the marketplace to buy anything in the blink of an eye!\n * Developer SDK so that anyone can easily build their own decentralized\n   applications on the Particl network.\n\nWe are excited to show what true privacy in eCommerce looks like this week in\nNew York, both at MCC and Consensus conference. Although we may be extremely\nbusy during that time, we will not forget to report everything that happens here\nso that you can live these events with us. If you are there, do not hesitate to\npass at our booth to test the marketplace and get some Particl or Bitcoin\nbranded goodies.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-gZG9HtTiXDgtDcLDGYpbgQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

It is a complex combination of peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy protocols.

This much is evidenced not only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on <a href=\"http://github.com/particl\">Github</a> but by the very noticeable progress being made on the Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl project has found itself being <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9\"><strong>ranked high in almost all development-related rankings of blockchain projects</strong></a>.</p><p>And here we are, in New York City, presenting the <strong>Particl Open Marketplace live on the main network for the first time ever</strong>!</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-rxsJBXQxnvGWIqJb9-_k-A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>After 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is nearly over ?</p><p>Starting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain, Particl created a first:</p><p>→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is thought of with maximum privacy and security in mind.

Whereas last year was focused on building the base\nlayer for the Open Marketplace, this year has been all about refining it and\nstarting to add new features on top of it. That doesn’t mean, however, that the\nonly milestones reached this year were about the marketplace! Here’s a complete\nlist of all the accomplishments and deliverables Particl had so far this year:\n\nParticl Copay 5.4.1 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44] (Jan 17th): A\nnew version of Particl Copay was released on the 17th of January and marked a\nrenewed active development for Particl’s mobile application.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the\nnetwork as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the\nfunctioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing\nmessages around the network and make the governance system work. The hardfork\nwent through without any issue and the network is now ready for the mainnet\nrelease of the marketplace.\n\nHardfork Successful [https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83]\n?

While we initially intended to move entirely on Discord and put\nTelegram in read-only mode, our travels around the world have made it clear we\ncouldn’t do that as some countries exclusively use Telegram. Nevertheless, the\nteam has been mostly moved over there and our Discord server will be the main\nplatform we’ll focus on moving forward even though we will keep our Telegram\nchannel open.\n\nParticl is Officially Moving to Discord\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nThe Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever\nsince\nwe abandoned Slack more than a year…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365]\n\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d] \n(March 8th): On the 8th March, Particl reached a big milestone by releasing its\nOpen Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on testnet.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big\nconference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and\nintroducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community.\nNot only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also\nproved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major\nconferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto\nConference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace\nwould be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect\nour commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first\nmainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions\nenabled by default.\n\nAdditionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the\nBitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after\nBitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the\nrelease of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of\ntime the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the\nescrow mechanism.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
