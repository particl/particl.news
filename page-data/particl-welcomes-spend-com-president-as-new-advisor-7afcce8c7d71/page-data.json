Woods is\na veteran with more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries. He brings extensive expertise and reach within the retail and\nconsumer markets and will pro-actively work in bridging the gap between the\ntraditional finance sector and cryptocurrency.\n\nMr. Woods will advise Particl on the opportunities to disrupt the fintech\nindustry that are currently being opened up by distributed technologies and how\nbest to capitalize on them. In addition, Woods will actively work on realizing\nthese opportunities by tapping right into his vast network of merchants and\nbusinesses and connect them with Particl for its world-class technologies and\ndecentralized services.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Case for Connecting Fintech Businesses to Particl\nMany businesses, like tech companies operating outside the cryptocurrency\nindustry but actively looking to modernize and optimize their business flow, can\nbenefit from Particl’s range of decentralized services. For example, a business\nmay simply want to accept cryptocurrency payments, but another may also need to\ntransfer data securely and privately, without third-party custody of the data.\nIn that case, they could use Particl’s peer-to-peer data storage network called\nSMSG and integrate it into their model.\n\nOnline retailers, who constantly need to lower their costs or worry about the\nprivacy and security of their data may want to open shop and sell products on\nParticl’s decentralized and private-by-default marketplace. After all, it\ncharges no commission! Other companies may only have a need for Particl’s double\ndeposit escrow system to keep certain parties in check with each other.\n\n> “Through his many years working right in the heart of the payment industry,\nBryan has developed lasting relationships with many businesses that are\ncurrently looking for ways to implement distributed technologies.Bryan will be\nworking closely with Particl to advise on the exact needs and requirements of\nthese companies and actively help onboarding them with Particl’s wide array of\ndecentralized services.” —Gerlof van Ek, Co-Founder at Particl\n\nIn fact, most businesses have surprisingly high levels of inefficiencies. This\ncosts them profits, time, and opportunities. Some of these hurdles are caused by\nhuman activity, regulations, politics, but some of them are also caused by\ntechnological bottlenecks. Coincidentally, it appears that more and more\nbusinesses realize the potential that distributed technologies present (P2P,\nblockchain). Of course, most of them would never dare, nor need to, go “full\ncrypto”, but just the right amount of distributed technology at the right place\nwithin their operations can make all the difference.\n\nThis shift of mentality within the traditional finance industry is opening up a\nlot of doors, and this is the opportunity that Bryan Woods wants to seize, with\nParticl.\n\n> Note: While Particl has already met and been introduced to some businesses\nwithin Bryan’s network, it may still take some time until the first few\nimplementations are ready and deployed. It is not impossible that the first few\ndeployments will occur in early 2020, as opposed to 2019. As always, follow\nParticl.news to not miss any update!\nLeveraging Spend.com’s Technology\nThe coming of Bryan as an advisor also opens up many interplay opportunities\nbetween both Spend and Particl’s ecosystems.\n\nSpend is a next-generation banking ecosystem with tens of thousands of active\nusers. It acts as a fiat gateway and “banking services 2.0\" provider. Its\nall-in-one mobile application allows you to hold, transfer, deposit, and\nwithdraw multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat (currently only USD and CAD) without\nrequiring a bank. Spend also makes spending very easy through its different\nSpend Visa payment card options that automatically and instantly converts any\ncurrency enabled for card payments into the currency requested by the merchant.\nFurther down the line, it is also intended for Spend App to include many other\nservices, such as loans, interest, and even a full-blown merchant or marketplace\nintegration. The end goal for Spend is to keep all the financial activities of\nits users within the Spend App itself. Think of it as the ultimate banking\napplication.\n\nIn addition to connecting Particl and other businesses together, Bryan and his\nteam at Spend will actively explore, along with the Particl team, how both\nprojects can synergize together to push the adoption of distributed technologies\nand cryptocurrencies to a wider audience.\n\nOn one hand, Spend.com offers a full suite of gateway and payment services that\ncan help onboard people to the Particl platform much more effectively. These\nservices include the near-instant and cost-effective swap of currencies, fiat on\nand off-ramps, Visa payment cards, and etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the multiple decentralized services produced by the Particl\nteam can allow Spend’s ecosystem to blossom into a powerful application that\nseamlessly combines the traditional banking industry and distributed\ntechnologies, making the adoption of new users into alternative banking and\ncryptocurrencies much easier than ever.\n\nA Methodical & Strategic Approach to Increasing Particl’s Stability\nBy integrating Particl’s decentralized services into other businesses, an\nincreased number of transactions is expected to occur on the native Particl\nblockchain and on the markets, providing the entire network and its various\napplications (i.e. Particl’s decentralized marketplace) with more privacy,\nliquidity, and stability.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this new strategic relationship between Bryan\nWoods and the Particl team marks the official beginning of a long-term and very\nstrategic play to take the banking and eCommerce worlds through the next\nevolutionary hop. As a result, to ensure the trading markets can absorb the new\ninflux of activity caused by businesses integrating Particl services,\nintegrations will be deployed methodically, one by one, in a way that ensures\nmarket stability. Over time, each added integration will contribute to\nincreasing the overall liquidity of the markets, making it easier to deploy more\nintegrations and more services at a much faster pace.\n\nParticl’s First Few Steps Towards a Comprehensive SDK\nFor Particl, this phase also marks a very important milestone. These are the\nfirst few steps towards building and packaging a comprehensive developer SDK. \nThe process of building integrations for third-parties will give the team a\nbrand new perspective on what components are the most critical for developers\nlooking forward to using a Particl SDK and will considerably speed up the\nprocess of finalizing and releasing it. In a way, the team will have to go\nthrough some of the same steps developers will go through when using the SDK, so\nhighlighting needs and issues should be much quicker.\n\nSuch integrations will demonstrate that with a bit of creativity, blockchain\ntechnology and cryptocurrencies can offer very practical and disruptive\nsolutions to some of the most pressing issues present within the traditional\nbanking, payment, and eCommerce systems.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Bryan Woods\n> Bryan has more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries.

With this very focused objective in mind, developers have\nbeen hard at work to bring forward the key features required before the Open\nMarketplace becomes “adoption-ready”. And things have been moving pretty fast!\n\nBitcoin to be Accepted on Particl\nIn-wallet Bitcoin Exchange (Mainnet Screenshot)On November 1st, Particl announced the upcoming integration of an in-wallet\nexchange module [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] \nto make it super easy for shoppers to buy anything on the marketplace using\nBitcoin. In fact, this new feature is so close to being released that the\nParticl team members flying out to the Slush Helsinki conference have brought\nwith them private builds of the Open Marketplace, on mainnet, WITH the Bitcoin\nexchange module included\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1197137822261665792]. Additionally,\nsince earlier today, the build that they have brought with them is also\navailable on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.0] for everyone to\nplay with.\n\nThis new exchange module, made possible thanks to a brand new SMSG-powered bot\nintegrated right into Particl Desktop, also marks the first step towards\nincluding many more currencies on Particl’s Open Marketplace. This is a critical\nfeature that will allow almost any cryptocurrency user to be able to shop\nonline, on Particl, without fees and without putting any of their personal\ninformation or data at risk. Just swap your coins for Particl right from Particl\nDesktop!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarket Management is Next!\nThe Particl team is taking no time in between major feature releases and is now\nworking on the final integration tweaks required for the Market Management\nfeature to be ready. This major Particl feature will drastically change how the\nOpen Marketplace is interacted with and open up a ton of possibilities for\nsellers and buyers both.\n\nWhat’s “Market Management”?\nMarket Management is a new tool that significantly changes how Particl’s\nmarketplace behaves and is interacted with. It is, simply put, an added\nfunctionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and\nstorefronts. Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl\nmarketplace available, it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user\nmarkets or storefronts that anyone can create. It will, however, remain as the\ndefault marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access\nto and see this giant public marketplace.\n\n> For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be\nreferred to as “markets”.\nWhile the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities\nof Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up,\nright?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating\nthe code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions\ncomes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.\n\n> Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.\nSeller Profiles and Identities\nSeller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought\nforth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.\n\nSeller profiles, identities, and market in short…The seller profile: A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and\nmany profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be\nconnected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an\ninfinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or\ncreates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A\nseller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.\n\nIdentities: Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key\nis used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content\nwhile the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A\nprofile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to\ncreate a market.\n\nIdentities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That\ncan either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or\nexpose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the\nmaximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every\ntime you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities\ntogether nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.\n\nTo sum it up, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This\nseller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts.\nEach market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities\nwhich cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.\n\n> Note: Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version\nof Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the\nwallet.\nMarket Browser\nAnother huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a\ncompletely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage,\nflag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market\nManagement tool and is separated into three distinct categories.\n\nMarket Browser (WIP, subject to change)Available Markets: The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly\navailable markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets\nthat have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The\nAvailable tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and\nstorefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market\nID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that\nyou can easily share them with other people.\n\nJoined Markets: The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you\nhave joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets\nwith a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code\n(the “Market ID”).\n\nYour markets: The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote\nmarkets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to\ngo if you want to create a brand market of your own.\n\nCreate a New Market or Storefront\nCreate a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)Market Management gives you the\nability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by\nchoosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll\nfind in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and\npermissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put\nsimply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a\nregular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.\n\nPublicly listed or not? Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the\nMarket Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market\nBrowser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code\n(the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it.\nWhen a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone\nthat doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To\nbe publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running\nParticl, a market has to be “listed”, for a small market listing/promotion fee\nthat is then redistributed to stakers.\n\nA “public” market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser\nby its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public\nmarkets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without\nhaving to know its access code (“Market ID”).\n\nMarket or Storefront? When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two\ndifferent types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two\ntypes of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that\nanyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products\nwhereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.\n\nIn fact, storefronts are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can\nset up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been\ngiven the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders.\nFor more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can\npublish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that\nthey have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of\nMarket Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given\nstorefront.\n\nStorefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores,\npersonalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are\nalso ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.\n\nJust like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market\nBrowser or not.\n\nPromote a Market\nPromoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted”\nicon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying\na small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the\nParticl network.\n\nMarket Governance\nEvery market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user\ngovernance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a\nmarket can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when\ntoo many people report it.\n\nMarket Management Development Status\nThe marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of\nthe Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything\nis smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki\nconference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few\ntests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!\n\n> Note: Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI\nintegration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this\nblog post.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nMarket Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what\nare going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it. Here are two\nof the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added\nsoon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.\n\nInventory Management\nPreview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)The\nInventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to\nthe marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory\nmanagement capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell\npre-determined amounts of items.\n\nOn the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple\ntimes without requiring the seller to create new listings.\n\nInventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the\nfirst OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e.\nchoosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).\n\nAdjustable Escrow\nAnother key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability\nto adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and\nthe buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of\nthe value of the item being purchased.\n\nWith an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of\nthe value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the\nescrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be\nrequired to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.\n\nA lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double\ndeposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far\nfrom ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or\nthat has a shaky or disputed reputation.\n\nFor sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need\nthe escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for\neach sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their\ncustomers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something\ncustomers would like to bypass as well.\n\nLet’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell\nproducts on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They\nhave a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential\nissue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple\nselling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and\nconsumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that\nspecific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle\nand not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the\ncustomer).\n\nIt is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and\nthat you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out\nentirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the\nadded benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process\nof buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like\nautomatic processing and delivery of digital items.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020,\nyou’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of\nthem bringing new features and noticeable improvements.\n\nAs always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through\ncommunity testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback\nof the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by\ncollecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the\nmarketplace will get better. If you encounter any issue or have feedback for the\ndevelopers, never hesitate to log an issue on Github by clicking on the “Report\na bug” icon at the bottom left of the Particl Desktop client, or simply by\nfollowing this link: https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues. This is\nthe simplest way to voice your opinion and a sure way for you to make sure the\ndevelopers will see it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-HD9QKfTUuqqxOx30CYDCBg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"create-and-join-an-unlimited-number-of-markets-\">Create and Join an Unlimited Number of Markets ?</h3><p>The Particl team is moving fast and methodically!

It can be connected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an infinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or creates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A seller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.</p><p><strong>Identities:</strong> Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key is used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content while the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A profile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to create a market.</p><p>Identities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That can either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or expose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the maximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every time you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities together nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.</p><p><strong>To sum it up</strong>, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This seller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts. Each market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities which cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version of Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the wallet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"market-browser\">Market Browser</h3><p>Another huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a completely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage, flag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market Management tool and is separated into three distinct categories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-K0kMclqwOPZkJo5ffunCGg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Market Browser (WIP, subject to change)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Available Markets:</strong> The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly available markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets that have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The Available tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and storefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market ID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that you can easily share them with other people.</p><p><strong>Joined Markets: </strong>The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you have joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets with a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code (the “Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Your markets:</strong> The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote markets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to go if you want to create a brand market of your own.</p><h3 id=\"create-a-new-market-or-storefront\">Create a New Market or Storefront</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-6HRfeYPykMHYnb46Bu_gXQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Create a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management gives you the ability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by choosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll find in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and permissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put simply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a regular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.</p><p><strong>Publicly listed or not? </strong>Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market Browser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code (the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it. When a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone that doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To be publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running Particl, a market has to be “listed”, <strong>for a small market listing/promotion fee that is then redistributed to stakers.</strong></p><p>A <strong>“public”</strong> market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser by its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public markets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without having to know its access code (“Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Market or Storefront?</strong> When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two different types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two types of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that anyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products whereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-bvwUL0TWSKaQ6ba9V7dCNg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>In fact, <strong>storefronts </strong>are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can set up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been given the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders. For more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can publish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that they have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of Market Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given storefront.</p><p>Storefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores, personalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are also ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.</p><p>Just like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not.</p><h3 id=\"promote-a-market\">Promote a Market</h3><p>Promoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted” icon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying a small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the Particl network.</p><h3 id=\"market-governance\">Market Governance</h3><p>Every market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user governance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a market can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when too many people report it.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-development-status\">Market Management Development Status</h3><p>The marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of the Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything is smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki conference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few tests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI integration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this blog post.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><p>Market Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what are going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it. Here are two of the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added soon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-management\">Inventory Management</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-knGEEEDMYRZ-yVxf3Uf8Ww.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Preview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>The Inventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to the marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory management capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell pre-determined amounts of items.</p><p>On the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple times without requiring the seller to create new listings.</p><p>Inventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the first OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e. choosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow\">Adjustable Escrow</h3><p>Another key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability to adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and the buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item being purchased.</p><p>With an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of the value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the escrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be required to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.</p><p>A lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double deposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far from ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or that has a shaky or disputed reputation.</p><p>For sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need the escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for each sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their customers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something customers would like to bypass as well.</p><p>Let’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell products on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They have a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential issue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple selling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and consumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that specific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle and not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the customer).</p><p>It is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and that you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out entirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the added benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process of buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like automatic processing and delivery of digital items.</p><hr><p>Particl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020, you’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of them bringing new features and noticeable improvements.</p><p>As always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through community testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback of the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by collecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the marketplace will get better.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
