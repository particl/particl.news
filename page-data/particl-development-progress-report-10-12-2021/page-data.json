So see you all on Monday! Oh, right, it's time for our\nweekly development update first! ?\n\nThis week, most of the focus has been on adding a few key improvements to the\nmarketplace and desktop client after receiving various feedback from the\ncommunity. While these fixes may seem mundane to some, they fix relatively\nencumbering issues that affect both buyers and sellers in different cases. A few\nexamples of these improvements will be given in the Particl Desktop progress\nreport section of this blog post.\n\nAdditionally, we mentioned last week that, due to the larger-than-expected scope\nof adding digital items delivery, we were evaluating whether we'd include that\nfeature in Particl Desktop 3.1 or not. After looking at the situation, we've\nopted not to include it. \n\nA big reason for this decision is that Particl Desktop 3.1 now includes a lot of\nimportant and quality-of-life fixes and improvements over the initial mainnet\nrelease of Particl V3. Delaying their release would be counter-productive and\nunnecessary. Indeed, some of these fixes are relatively critical for some users,\nand so we're prioritizing releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 faster so that these\nusers can benefit from the fixes and gain back a better user experience.\n\nWith that in mind, we've started planning ahead for the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 on testnet. We're finalizing the last few remaining items planned\nfor 3.1 and will then build a testnet client for community testing. We'll\ncommunicate more details on the testnet release in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nIn the intro of this progress report, we've mentioned that several improvements\nhave been added to Particl Desktop, notably relating to Particl Marketplace.\n\nFor example, we've added a shortcut in the Send/Convert page to split a\ntransaction into multiple outputs, which should make it more visible as well as\neasier to set on a transaction-per-transaction basis. This has been a\nmuch-requested improvement by some of our vendors as it previously caused them\nsome issues, especially concerning the process of publishing listings.\n\nAlso, if something goes wrong during a transaction and one party does not\nreceive an updated order status from the other party (which means their client\ndidn't properly pick up the intended SMSG message), that other party can now\nsimply press a button that's been added to the order flow which conveniently\nallows for their last action status to be rebroadcast. It was possible to do\njust that in the past, but it required commands to be entered manually in the\nconsole window; a less-than-ideal user experience. This isn't needed anymore and\ncan be accomplished with the simple click of a button.\n\nSimilar to the item above, another button has been added. This one rescans SMSG\nmessages (executes the smsgscanbuckets command) for you, so in the case where it\nmight appear that an SMSG message was unproperly received, you can just click on\nthat button so that your client tries to find and process the message.\n\nAnother small change that was added is the display of a count of new listings\nthat are not yet displayed in the market browser. Previously, an alert indicator\nwould be displayed over the refresh button; this is still there but now a count\nof how many new items have been received is also displayed near the refresh\nbutton.\n\nAside from these, a variety of bug fixes and general improvements have been\nadded, as is usual, making this week one that ended up being quite productive\nand helpful in improving the general user experience.\n\nWith all of that being said, here's the list of remaining items to be included\nin Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress and is expected to be\n   wrapped up next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above item is completed. It is expected to resume next\n   week or so and is also expected to be wrapped up relatively quickly.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). While this task has seen some progress since it was started, it will\n   not be included in Particl Desktop 3.1 and is pushed for later on. \n\nKeeping the listed items above in mind, we will be starting the process of\nbuilding and releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet very soon. \n\nAs always, we'd rather not give a precise date or estimate for its release, but\nwe hope to begin the process towards the end of next week. We'll give you more\naccurate details on this in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl's Core Developer, Tecnovert, has focused mostly on Particl\nCore and on preparing the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIndeed, Particl Core 0.21.2.5 has been pre-released a couple of days ago and you\ncan now download and install it by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.5].

Indeed, on the 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC, the\nParticl blockchain will hardfork and include a variety of new features,\nincluding Taproot activation.\n\nWe'll make a formal announcement on the hardfork next week and will include in\nit all the necessary details about it. We'll also publish in that blog post a\ncomplete list of the new features and changes it will introduce.\n\nPlease note that, if you still have disabled outputs as a result of the\nemergency hardfork that happened earlier this year, you will need to submit your\nclaim to have them re-activated before the hardfork. Failure to do so means\nyou'll need to wait for the next, subsequent hardfork to have your outputs\nre-activated. To learn more about how to submit your claim, please refer to\nthis\nblog post [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\n\nAside from that, there have been some minor improvements made to BasicSwap's\nunderlying protocol, notably around its UI and the use of RingCT/CT swaps. We\nare still working towards launching the Open Beta soon and will give more\ndetailed information on this as soon as we can.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe'd like to thank you, as always, for your passion, dedication, and various\ncontributions to the Particl project.

This blog\npost will let you know everything you need about the hardfork and about how to\nprepare ahead. Letâs jump in directly and look at the details more closely.\n\n> Note: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.18\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18] or greater if\nyou havenât already done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will\nlead you to connect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other\npeople will not be relayed and you won't be earning staking rewards.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardfork Schedule\nIn the first place, Particlâs testnet will hardfork on the 1st of January 2022,\nat 17:00 UTC. This will provide the ability for everybody to ensure that\neverything goes as expected. \n\nThen, on the 1st of February 2022, at 17:00 UTC, Particl's mainnet network will\nhardfork.\n\nPrepare Ahead\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and ensure future functionality of\nyour Particl apps, you need to update your Particl Core node to the latest\nversion available [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]. \n\nOnce you've updated your node(s), you don't need to do anything; you'll\nautomatically fork to the right chain, along with the rest of the network, on\nthe 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC.\n\nThe update procedure differs depending on your environment.\n\nParticl Desktop\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, close it down completely and re-open it. The\nclient will update itself automatically. Look at the bottom left corner of your\nclient; the \"core\" version should display 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Partyman\nIf you are cold staking using Particlâs cold staking application Partyman, enter\nthis command to update your node.\n\ncd ~/partyman && ./partyman update\n\nVerify that the update went on as expected by executing this command.\n\n./partyman status\n\nThe displayed version should be version 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Core - QT Wallet\nWith a standalone Particl Core - QT wallet, you need to download and install the\nlatest version manually.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.18 Â· particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019218Hashes121365dec50e99eba4c25a2d7ff2a1e968949717bd0d8d6706c3f172fd596373\nparticl-0.19.2.18-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]Particl Copay\nIf you use the mobile Particl Copay wallet, then no user interaction is required\nfrom you. The core version will be updated automatically in time for the\nhardfork.\n\nPART Coins on Cold Staking Pools\nIf you stake coins on cold staking pools, then you don't need to do anything\nother than to ensure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with Particl\n0.19.2.18 or greater. \n\nHowever, you must be aware that if the pool you're staking on doesn't update\ntheir nodes in time for the hardfork, you'll be staking on the wrong chain and\nthus, won't be receiving rewards. For this reason, make sure the cold staking\npool you're staking on updates in time. You can usually do this by appending \n/version or /api/version at the end of the pool's URL (i.e., \nhttps://coldstakingpool.com/api/version). \n\nIf you are the operator of a pool, please follow these instructions\n[https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.md] to\nupdate your node.\n\nPART Coins on Exchanges\nWe have started reaching out to exchanges on which PART is available in\npreparation for this hardfork.\n\nAs is usual, no customer interaction is needed as exchanges manage their own\nnodes. However, make sure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with the latest\nversion of Particl Core.\n\nWhatâs New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings more privacy and smaller transaction fees to Particl\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], \nBasicSwap [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) and for a\nwide variety of transaction types.\n\nparticl-core/fork-notes.md at master Â· particl/particl-coreParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/master/doc/fork-notes.md#rct-bug-fix-fork-3]\nTaproot\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction.\n\nFixing listing fee adjustment feature\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower. \n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability has been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, once the fee target amount drops below\na certain point, the code won't allow it to change anymore (up or down). This\nhardfork fixes that issue by clamping the minimum amount it can change to 1 sat,\nmaking the feature functional and allowing stakers to adjust listing fees again.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThis hardfork will also re-enable a small number of disabled outputs from people\nwhoâve missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and\nhavenât put up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the\nsteps mentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\nFailure to submit your claim before the hardfork will mean youâll have to wait\nfor the next one. If you donât have any disabled outputs, or simply donât know\nwhat this is about, then you donât need to do anything here.\n\n> Note: The deadline to submit your claim for this hardfork is on the 1st of\nJanuary 2022, at 17:00 UTC.\nReducing money supply when outputs are burned (for future use)\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis hardfork is an important one for the ecosystem, notably with the major\naddition of Taproot and the fix to the listing fee adjustment mechanism. \n\nWe recommend that you update your node(s) as soon as possible; failure to do so\nin time for the hardfork will result in you being on the wrong chain.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

While they\naggressively charge you for every sale you make, they also get to see all of\nyour sales data; valuable information to have if you want to launch products.\nEven better if you plan on launching copycats! In more than one way, just by\nselling on their platform, they get you to pay themâ¦to do their market research.\nInsulting, isnât it?\n\nSee, the problematic issue here is that Amazon doesn't expose itself to any risk\nwhen launching a new product, nor do they go through the time and effort of\nresearching consumer needs and likes; thatâs your burden to carry if you want to\nsucceed, and their success to steal if you do! Instead, Amazon simply accesses\n'your' sales data that you generate when using their platform and use some AI to\ninstantly know what products are selling best or will sell best in the future.\nThen, all thatâs left for them to do is to hand the identified product (aka your\nproduct) over to a third-party manufacturer who will create a copycat out of it,\nwith a few minor modifications so that they can avoid almost any patent. The end\nresult? An AmazonBasics product (or one that is sold under any of their\nsub-brands\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-owns-these-brands-list-2018-7]) thatâs\nmuch cheaper than the original, both in priceâ¦and quality.\n\nItâs a cynically cost-effective strategy for an organization that has a\nnear-infinite budget and customer reach. And itâs much more so when they control\nwhat is likely to be the worldâs most popular online marketplace. \n\nThey copied you, but youâre still making more sales than theyâd like? No\nproblem, theyâll just move you to page 10! And while that may sound like a\nshort-term win for consumers because it gets them cheaper products, it is really\na net loss for all when nobody wants to innovate and come up with new products\nanymore out of fear of being screwed over.\n\nThink of it. Imagine being the inventor of a copied product, who invested the\nintellectual and financial capital into its development, put in blood, sweat,\nand tears to get it to production, only to be screwed over right at the moment\nthat he starts getting a tiny bit of success with his product. And Amazon, who\nwere making a handsome (exorbitant) commission selling the original product in\nthe first place, go on to brazenly become your direct competitor using an\nobvious copycat. Of course, to make things even worse, Amazon gets to sell their\nproduct without paying the exorbitant sales fees any other vendor would be\nforced to pay. And so, the consumer loses, the small and local businesses as\nwell, the product inventors too, but Amazon gets to rake in billions of dollars.\nSounds fair and ethicalâ¦not!\n\nPrivacy in eCommerceâââProtect Your BusinessHow Privacy Can Help You Keep Your\nBusiness AliveParticl Newsdros\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/]\nOpportunistic Behaviour, aka 'Screwing Partners Over'\nLet's look at things from a different perspective.\n\nImagine you start a company that produces something that is 'better than sliced\nbread'. Youâve made it; your business has become successful, and Amazon's\nventure capital arm reaches out to you. Sounds exciting, right? Well, slow down\na little and let's take a look at a couple of examples that might make you\nreconsider whether you would even want to talk to them.\n\nA while ago, Amazonâs fund invested in Defined Crowd [https://www.defined.ai/].\nAs part of that investment, Amazon got access to the finances as well as the\ntechnology of Defined Crowd. Four years later, Daniela Braga, the founder and\nCEO of the company, accused Amazon of stealing their concept\n[https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2020/report-companies-say-amazon-accessed-proprietary-info-to-make-its-own-products/] \nand launching it as A21, a service of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is in\ndirect competition with them. Dealing with Amazon can turn a supposedly helpful\ncapital boost into your worst nightmare.\n\nUbi, who build smart speakers, met Amazon to discuss funding for their product\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-ubi-smart-speaker-2020-7]. Amazon\nwent through their entire pitch, the tech behind it, and shortly afterwards,\nlaunched Echo. Yes, the same Echo that powers Alexa. It was a concept imagined\nby someone who had a billion-dollar idea, but it more than likely ended up being\nstolen and developed by a company too big to drag through court.\n\nIndeed, Amazon has so many more reports of unethical behaviours and unfair,\nanti-competitive practices. Want to hear more about it? Just take this example\nfrom India where Amazon was caught red-handing manipulating search results to\nbenefit their own products and competing ones (and in many cases, original\nproducts that Amazon simply copied, as we mentioned above).\n\nAmazon copied products and rigged search results, documents showA trove of\nAmazon documents reveals how the company ran a campaign in India of creating\nknockoff goods and manipulating search results to boost its own\nproducts.Reuters\nADITYA KALRA in New Delhi and STEVE STECKLOW in London\n[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/]In\nthe end, in all of those cases, someone or a business got AMAZONED!\n\nThankfully, Amazon is gradually being made more accountable and is having to \nanswer to the US House Judiciary Committee\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/house-committee-threatens-amazon-with-criminal-investigation-into-market-dominance] \nfor its immoral and unethical behaviours, but who knows what positive changes\nthat will bring, if any. But really, there is a way for you to protect yourself\nfrom this toxic relationship. Imagine this...\n\nImagine taking Amazon out of your life. Even better, imagine taking any\ncorporate-powered online marketplace like eBay, Alibaba, Etsy, or even payment\nprocessors like Paypal out of your life. Because after all, they all operate\nmore or less the same predatory way.\n\nImagine getting a 5% to 60% (!!!) discount on products and services you buy. You\nknowâ¦what these corporations would typically charge you.\n\nImagine buying unique, more affordable, and more varied products that donât\nusually end up on their platform. Maybe they come from countries that have no\naccess to them, or maybe they simply donât want these products around.\n\nImagine if you could directly support local businesses, not corporations, by\ntrading directly with them without anybody in between.\n\nImagine buying or selling stuff online without sharing all your personal\ninformation and data to greedy corporations eager to abuse it for a cheap buck.\nGoodbye leaked credit cards and identify thefts.\n\nImagine buying \"intimate gifts\" for your girlfriend without your wife knowing\nabout it or, huh, well, you know, buying anything without leaving a trace behind\nfor whatever reason applies to you ? #PrivacyMatters\n\nImagine no More!\nStop imagining and start doing whatâs best for you now because all of this is\nnow possible thanks to decentralized eCommerce (âDeCommerceâ). \n\nDeCommerce has been steadily on the rise in recent years, letting anybody safely\nbuy or sell anything online without any restriction and without going through\nany middleman. So imagine trading directly with other people, without paying any\nfee, and without any restriction or shady practices we too often see. The future\nis here!\n\nDeCommerce is indeed the next logical step towards a world that is freer and a\nfairer. Towards a world where our right to privacy still exists. One where equal\nopportunities are available to all with no regards to where you come from or to\nwho you are.\n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. The DeCommerce revolution\nis already well-underway here at Partic [https://particl.io/marketplace]l\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].

Of course, to make things even worse, Amazon gets to sell their product without paying the exorbitant sales fees any other vendor would be forced to pay. And so, the consumer loses, the small and local businesses as well, the product inventors too, but Amazon gets to rake in billions of dollars.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first
