We can obviously point the finger at climate changes, but data centers,\n   especially in the western half of the United States, have a big portion of\n   the blame to take as well.\n * 30% of all data centers in the world are located in the USA, many in the\n   western half of it.\n * Tax breaks may help build data centers\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/arizona-passes-data-center-tax-breaks/] \n   but just who takes the responsibility to monitor the depletion of rivers,\n   lakes, and groundwater reservoirs these data centers cause?\n * In the U.S., the daily water consumption by data centers that report such\n   figures exceeds 1.7 billion liters of water.\n * This number is expected to only be 1/3rd of their actual consumption as it\n   only monitors the water consumption of their cooling systems.\n * Amazon, for example, does not bother measuring or reporting the water usage\n   of their data centers, a worrying fact considering Amazon’s AWS service is\n   powered by one of the biggest data center networks in the country\n   [https://www.wpoven.com/blog/aws-market-share/]. And don’t forget, Amazon’s\n   data consumption isn’t limited to AWS; its cloud outlets, Alexa product and,\n   of course, its Amazon.com [/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/Amazon.com] \n   marketplace, all require massive data warehouses to hold and process the\n   amount of data they collect.\n * And then, one out of five data centers is placed near a water reservoir which\n   is already stressed because of the nearby population. Water cooling is\n   cheaper than air cooling and it uses less energy, sure, but it creates water\n   shortages which tend to often be kept out of the public environmental debate.\n * Arizona for example, which is one of the hottest and driest states in the\n   U.S., is trying to become a new Silicon Valley. However, it relies on Lake\n   Mead (Hoover Dam) which is currently at a record low of 35% capacity\n   [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/06/10/lake-mead-water-lowest-hoover-dam-built-colorado-river-shortage/7640437002/]\n   . To make things worse, the Colorado River has lost 18% of its flow! But\n   still, companies are granted tax breaks, rebates, and promises of access to\n   water by some of the same people who claim to be fighting for the\n   environment.\n * Apple\n   [https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/10/apple-plans-major-expansions-at-arizona-and-nevada-data-centers]\n   , Google\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/mesa-council-approves-1bn-google-arizona-data-center-16m-tax-breaks/]\n   , Facebook\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/huge-data-center-moves-forward-in-mesa-despite-arizona-water-concerns/]\n   , and many other tech giants are already in Arizona, and are starting to\n   expand. That'll require more and more of that already rare water in the\n   region.\n * In Texas, Google requests 6.64 billion liters of water per year. Yes, a\n   single data center uses 10% of all its region’s water reserves which contains\n   20 towns.\n * In the meantime, Dallas encourages its citizens (that’s you, the individual)\n   to use less water as their six reservoirs are 18% depleted. They have a\n   mandatory water restriction in place once this number hits 35%, but they\n   welcome with open arms the insane water requests from tech giants.\n * At least, some tech giants like Microsoft report the water consumption on\n   their cooling systems (but not their total water consumption). That’s unlike\n   Amazon, Google, and Facebook who don’t bother to release any numbers to the\n   public [https://time.com/5814276/google-data-centers-water/].\n * In fact, most of them have 'non-disclosure agreements' NDAs with water\n   companies and local governments\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/after-aquifer-concerns-googles-600m-south-carolina-expansion-finds-new-water-supply/]\n   , to make sure their actual water usage stays a secret. Oh, the hypocrisy!\n\nThat’s a lot to take in, right? By now you probably get the point, but the\nreality is that we’ll need more and more data centers as the worldkeeps on\nincreasing its online presence. As it happens, we will need more data centers to\nsupport the various web services that you use (they all collect as much as they\ncan about you, your activities, preferences, location, habits, etc). What’s\nmore, the promised advent and monetization of AI will drive companies to\nincrease the number of data they collect from all of us, making data the new oil\nor digital gold.\n\nIt's time for a change!\nNo point in calling Houston, this problem won’t go away until we change our\nhabits ourselves. Let’s not be hypocrites here; yes, tech giants act in a very\ndeceiving way and try to sweep the problem under the rug for their own benefit\nand image, but we, the end-user, are ultimately the ones that feed them with the\ndata. As long as we keep using data-hungry services, we are directly causing\nthese environmental issues. The more we use their platforms, the more their data\ncenters will need to grow and the more water will be consumed.\n\nAnd as our online presence is much more likely increase rather than decrease\nover the coming years, there’s a critical question that bears asking.\n\nWhat can I actually do to fix this problem?\nLet's focus on what's under our control. We can’t change the way big tech and\nother internet companies behave; they are and always have been big for-profit\ncorporations with questionable levels of ethics. What we can do is change our\nonline habits and stop feeding “the beast”.\n\n> “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” — Mahatma Gandhi\n“But how can I do this?”, you may ask. The answer may not be as hopeless as\nmight think. \n\nThe internet is currently experiencing what is perhaps its biggest revolution\nsince it began—the rise of \"Web 3\".\n\nWeb 3 is a general term used to reference a new type of applications and web\nservices that work without any third-party or middleman. They are often powered\nby blockchains or other peer-to-peer networks and manage data in a distributed\nway—data is hosted on the computers, or nodes, of the users rather than on\ncentral databases that literally suck the waters out of precious reserves.\n\nTake Particl Marketplace\n[/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/particl.io/marketplace], for example. It’s a\ndistributed online marketplace similar to eBay, but on which no data is\ngenerated. It provides all the essential tools you would need to buy and sell\nstuff online, but unlike eBay, Amazon, or Alibaba, it doesn’t require massive\ndata centers that evaporate our precious water reserves. In fact, it generates\nzero data and has a neutral water consumption level.\n\nOr take Skiff [https://skiff.org/] as another great example. It’s an end-to-end\nencrypted collaborative workspace that gives you similar abilities that you’d\nget using Google Docs, but it does so in a much more ethical way. First, it’s\nprivate and encrypted by default, meaning the company behind cannot collect any\nmeaningful data about you (meaning they then need to store much less of it). And\nsecondly, they are in the process of making their application completely\ndistributed, meaning they could then drastically reduce their \"water consumption\nfootprint\". What a breath of fresh air when you compare this philosophy to what\nbig tech does.\n\nBut you don't even have to step into the new world of Web 3 yet to make a\ndifference. Just change your DNS to one that doesn’t track your every move and\nstores that information in data centers! And by picking the right DNS, you might\neven block all those invasive and annoying ads that you see when you browse the\nweb, use your smart phone or smart tv, and etc. Sounds interesting? Then check\nout this list of recommended DNS servers\n[https://dt.gl/privacy-cookbook-ch-2-4-2021-best-of-dns/]. One small effort that\nimproves your online experience and helps to save our waters, what's not to\nlike?!\n\nChange is now! [https://dt.gl/privacy-cookbook-ch-2-4-2021-best-of-dns/]\nPeople talk a lot about energy consumption, renewable energies, and climate\nchange. But for some reason, water consumption rarely seems to receive the\nscrutiny it should. And you’ve got to wonder why; it is the most scarce treasure\nwe have and it’s rapidly becoming a nightmare to manage. But perhaps the\ncompanies who use the most of it are those with the deepest pockets\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632] and the\nmost...influence?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTogether, we can make a vast difference. All we need is to be aware of the\nproblem and the simple, low-efforts solutions we can all take to protect our\nblue gold. By opting to use Web 3 applications and services rather than\nplatforms powered by massive data centers, we can considerably reduce our levels\nof water consumption and make a real impact; the only reason tech giants need to\nbuild more and more data centers is because we keep on using their applications!\n\n> “Sometimes you’re the only one that can save yourself; for no one is coming to\nsave you.” — R.J.

While they\naggressively charge you for every sale you make, they also get to see all of\nyour sales data; valuable information to have if you want to launch products.\nEven better if you plan on launching copycats! In more than one way, just by\nselling on their platform, they get you to pay them…to do their market research.\nInsulting, isn’t it?\n\nSee, the problematic issue here is that Amazon doesn't expose itself to any risk\nwhen launching a new product, nor do they go through the time and effort of\nresearching consumer needs and likes; that’s your burden to carry if you want to\nsucceed, and their success to steal if you do! Instead, Amazon simply accesses\n'your' sales data that you generate when using their platform and use some AI to\ninstantly know what products are selling best or will sell best in the future.\nThen, all that’s left for them to do is to hand the identified product (aka your\nproduct) over to a third-party manufacturer who will create a copycat out of it,\nwith a few minor modifications so that they can avoid almost any patent. The end\nresult? An AmazonBasics product (or one that is sold under any of their\nsub-brands\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-owns-these-brands-list-2018-7]) that’s\nmuch cheaper than the original, both in price…and quality.\n\nIt’s a cynically cost-effective strategy for an organization that has a\nnear-infinite budget and customer reach. And it’s much more so when they control\nwhat is likely to be the world’s most popular online marketplace. \n\nThey copied you, but you’re still making more sales than they’d like? No\nproblem, they’ll just move you to page 10! And while that may sound like a\nshort-term win for consumers because it gets them cheaper products, it is really\na net loss for all when nobody wants to innovate and come up with new products\nanymore out of fear of being screwed over.\n\nThink of it. Imagine being the inventor of a copied product, who invested the\nintellectual and financial capital into its development, put in blood, sweat,\nand tears to get it to production, only to be screwed over right at the moment\nthat he starts getting a tiny bit of success with his product. And Amazon, who\nwere making a handsome (exorbitant) commission selling the original product in\nthe first place, go on to brazenly become your direct competitor using an\nobvious copycat. Of course, to make things even worse, Amazon gets to sell their\nproduct without paying the exorbitant sales fees any other vendor would be\nforced to pay. And so, the consumer loses, the small and local businesses as\nwell, the product inventors too, but Amazon gets to rake in billions of dollars.\nSounds fair and ethical…not!\n\nPrivacy in eCommerce — Protect Your BusinessHow Privacy Can Help You Keep Your\nBusiness AliveParticl Newsdros\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/]\nOpportunistic Behaviour, aka 'Screwing Partners Over'\nLet's look at things from a different perspective.\n\nImagine you start a company that produces something that is 'better than sliced\nbread'. You’ve made it; your business has become successful, and Amazon's\nventure capital arm reaches out to you. Sounds exciting, right? Well, slow down\na little and let's take a look at a couple of examples that might make you\nreconsider whether you would even want to talk to them.\n\nA while ago, Amazon’s fund invested in Defined Crowd [https://www.defined.ai/].\nAs part of that investment, Amazon got access to the finances as well as the\ntechnology of Defined Crowd. Four years later, Daniela Braga, the founder and\nCEO of the company, accused Amazon of stealing their concept\n[https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2020/report-companies-say-amazon-accessed-proprietary-info-to-make-its-own-products/] \nand launching it as A21, a service of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is in\ndirect competition with them. Dealing with Amazon can turn a supposedly helpful\ncapital boost into your worst nightmare.\n\nUbi, who build smart speakers, met Amazon to discuss funding for their product\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-ubi-smart-speaker-2020-7]. Amazon\nwent through their entire pitch, the tech behind it, and shortly afterwards,\nlaunched Echo. Yes, the same Echo that powers Alexa. It was a concept imagined\nby someone who had a billion-dollar idea, but it more than likely ended up being\nstolen and developed by a company too big to drag through court.\n\nIndeed, Amazon has so many more reports of unethical behaviours and unfair,\nanti-competitive practices. Want to hear more about it? Just take this example\nfrom India where Amazon was caught red-handing manipulating search results to\nbenefit their own products and competing ones (and in many cases, original\nproducts that Amazon simply copied, as we mentioned above).\n\nAmazon copied products and rigged search results, documents showA trove of\nAmazon documents reveals how the company ran a campaign in India of creating\nknockoff goods and manipulating search results to boost its own\nproducts.Reuters\nADITYA KALRA in New Delhi and STEVE STECKLOW in London\n[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/]In\nthe end, in all of those cases, someone or a business got AMAZONED!\n\nThankfully, Amazon is gradually being made more accountable and is having to \nanswer to the US House Judiciary Committee\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/house-committee-threatens-amazon-with-criminal-investigation-into-market-dominance] \nfor its immoral and unethical behaviours, but who knows what positive changes\nthat will bring, if any. But really, there is a way for you to protect yourself\nfrom this toxic relationship. Imagine this...\n\nImagine taking Amazon out of your life. Even better, imagine taking any\ncorporate-powered online marketplace like eBay, Alibaba, Etsy, or even payment\nprocessors like Paypal out of your life. Because after all, they all operate\nmore or less the same predatory way.\n\nImagine getting a 5% to 60% (!!!) discount on products and services you buy. You\nknow…what these corporations would typically charge you.\n\nImagine buying unique, more affordable, and more varied products that don’t\nusually end up on their platform. Maybe they come from countries that have no\naccess to them, or maybe they simply don’t want these products around.\n\nImagine if you could directly support local businesses, not corporations, by\ntrading directly with them without anybody in between.\n\nImagine buying or selling stuff online without sharing all your personal\ninformation and data to greedy corporations eager to abuse it for a cheap buck.\nGoodbye leaked credit cards and identify thefts.\n\nImagine buying \"intimate gifts\" for your girlfriend without your wife knowing\nabout it or, huh, well, you know, buying anything without leaving a trace behind\nfor whatever reason applies to you ? #PrivacyMatters\n\nImagine no More!\nStop imagining and start doing what’s best for you now because all of this is\nnow possible thanks to decentralized eCommerce (“DeCommerce”). \n\nDeCommerce has been steadily on the rise in recent years, letting anybody safely\nbuy or sell anything online without any restriction and without going through\nany middleman. So imagine trading directly with other people, without paying any\nfee, and without any restriction or shady practices we too often see. The future\nis here!\n\nDeCommerce is indeed the next logical step towards a world that is freer and a\nfairer. Towards a world where our right to privacy still exists. One where equal\nopportunities are available to all with no regards to where you come from or to\nwho you are.\n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. The DeCommerce revolution\nis already well-underway here at Partic [https://particl.io/marketplace]l\n[https://particl.io/marketplace]. All of the benefits you imagined above are\nalready available at your fingertips. \n\nIf you, too, want to see a better world and get more out of your honest money,\nthen come be a part of our global movement [https://particl.io/].
