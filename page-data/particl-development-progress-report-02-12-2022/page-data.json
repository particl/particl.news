The downside of\nmnemonics is if they're shared with others the private keys may be compromised\nfrom lack of security of those it's shared with.\n\nSplitting a secret into components using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS)\nalleviates this risk, but the benefit of using human readable words is lost\nsince secrets are typically encoded in a binary format.\n\nThis proposal is a way to split a BIP39 mnemonic into parts via SSSS without\nlosing the benefits of the original mnemonic encoding. This is achieved by\nencoding the SSSS shares as mnemonics themselves, which can then be distributed\nto others with much lower risk of the private keys of the original mnemonic\nbeing compromised or lost. — Shamir39's Specification Notes\n[https://github.com/iancoleman/shamir39/blob/master/specification.md]\nIn other words, Shamir39 allows you to split a mnemonic into equally secure\nparts and share it with others, as opposed to sharing half of a single mnemonic\nand, by doing so, halving the security of your wallet.\n\n * You can read more about the protocol here: \n   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing]\n\nBasicSwap ?\nJust as last week, we've been ensuring a smooth and stable public release of\nBasicSwap's open beta.

that has been made in\nthe development cycle. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements\nachieved in the past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe are working towards the mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, with our\ndesktop developer team gradually returning to full operational capacity\nfollowing an illness. \n\nCurrently, we are addressing an issue where the wallet module presents the\ncreate/restore flow for the default wallet when it does not yet exist, whereas\nif other wallets already exist, one of them needs to be set as the default.\n\nOver the weekend, we aim to make substantial progress in this regard and also\nadd two further features: transaction history data export in csv format to the\nwallet, and the wallet unlock notification to the marketplace dApp, which was\nomitted from the testnet build.\n\nOnce these components are all in place, we will start the process of releasing\nParticl Desktop 3.3 on mainnet. As we are still in the testnet phase, any\nsignificant problems detected will, of course, take precedent and be remedied\nbefore the release is completed.\n\nNote on Testnet ?\nParticl Desktop 3.3 is currently available on testnet, and the team is seeking\nadditional feedback and testing on its performance.\n\nSpecifically, we are looking to ensure that a \"clean install\" (i.e., no prior PD\nversion or Particl wallet present) is successful, as well as that all wallet,\nmarket, and main application settings are correctly configured and functioning\nas anticipated.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.\n\nThis week, we have, once again, been working on a series of complex Bitcoin\nmerges that have required a significant amount of time to complete. The\nimplementation of these updates does not add any new features to Bitcoin or\nParticl Core, however, it does help refine the underlying codebase, making it\nmore orderly and efficient.\n\nYou can monitor these changes by visiting this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, the majority of our efforts in regards to BasicSwap have been focused\non optimizing and adding new functions to the market making script and\nfinalizing the modifications for the updated version of the graphical user\ninterface.\n\nMarket Making Script ?\nWe are currently in the process of developing and testing a companion script\nwhich enables traders to perform basic market making functions using the\ndistributed order book of BasicSwap. This script allows for the ability to\nprogram parameters in order to maintain offers on the order book based on a\nmargin of the current market price.\n\nThis week, we have been focusing on adding additional functions such as the\ncapability for the script to also place bids automatically on offers that meet\ncertain predetermined criteria. This will enable traders to configure their\ntrading preferences and provide healthy liquidity to BasicSwap DEX with\npotential for steady profits.\n\nBy integrating this script with a cloud-based BasicSwap DEX instance to\nfacilitate its uninterrupted operations, we can offer simple and reliable market\nmaking tools to both professional and community liquidity providers.\n\nWe will keep you informed of the progress we make with regard to this script and\nwill announce when it will be available for community testing. Please stay\ntuned!\n\nPrivacy and Security Considerations ✅\nPrivacy and Liquidity Considerations in BasicSwapBasicSwap, AMM exchanges, and\nhow to make privacy coins more private in an era of centralized liquidity and\nexchanges.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/]Speaking of liquidity,\nmarket making, and distributed order book development, we have published a \ncomprehensive article [https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/] \noutlining the considerations taken into account when building BasicSwap and its\norder book system.\n\nThough many DEXs have integrated the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model,\nBasicSwap is not the first instance of distributed order book implementation.\n\nWhat makes it particularly unique, though, is its usage of adaptor\nsignature-based swaps — which ensure full privacy protection by moving\nswap-related data, such as transaction hashes which are typically traceable in\nthe case of \"regular\" atomic swaps — off-chain through scriptless scripts.\n\nThis article is a must-read for gaining an understanding of the design decisions\nmade in creating BasicSwap DEX and its emergence as a one-of-a-kind solution\nthat advances financial privacy to a new level.\n\n * Read the article here: \n   https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe have seen steady progress in regards to updating the user interface with\nseveral of its intended improvements.\n\nAlthough the task list remains unchanged from last week, we're slowly wrapping\nit up and should be ready to deploy these changes soon. You can refer to the\nlist below as a reminder of what we're working on:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
