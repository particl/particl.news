This week, we've had the pleasure of seeing the\nlong-anticipated release of Particl Electrum and have been making steady\nprogress on the various components that make our current primary focus.\n\nLet's get into the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week regarding Particl Desktop, has seen its focus split into two fronts.\n\nOn the in-market messaging front, we're continuing to make progress on the inbox\nsystem. We're currently nearing completion of its integration into the ordering\nprocess (buy flow), and once that is complete, we'll start on its listing-based\nintegration.\n\nAside from work being done on the new messaging system, we've received a few\nissue and bug reports from some of the vendors currently operating on the\nmarketplace. This has led to the discovery of a couple of issues in the\nmarketplace codebase, as well as the addition of additional functionalities.\n\nFor this reason, we've seen a temporary decrease in the number of listings\ncurrently published on the marketplace as some of the sellers, some of which\nhave encountered similar issues, are waiting for them to be resolved before\nrelisting. In some cases, the changes can be made locally, and so we expect some\nmore listings to come back up even before the next release of Particl Desktop\n3.2.\n\nBasicSwap and Particl Core Progress Update\nThis week has seen the long-anticipated release of Particl Electrum, the light\nwallet which lets you manage your PART wallets without having to sync the entire\nblockchain. As such, two releases have been made this week with the second one\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/] adding the ability to\ncold stake funds stored on Electrum using Partyman as well as introducing the\nability to send funds to stealth (private) PART addresses.\n\nParticl Electrum 4.2.1.4 AvailableCold stake funds held on Particl Electrum\nusing Partyman and send funds to stealth addresses.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/]But as mentioned,\nmanaging funds through the Particl Electrum client is merely scratching the\nsurface of what we intend to do with it. Indeed, its back-end codebase provides\nlight services that can be used to make distributed applications more\naccessible. In Particl's case, it becomes notably useful for future web and\nlight releases of BasicSwap and the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, large merges have been made from Bitcoin's upstream code into\nParticl Core.

This\nweek, we've got some exciting development on the side of Particl Desktop, with\nits new version finally nearing the beginning of the testnet round of testing!\n\nLet's jump right in and get into these details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week we've seen significant progress with the upcoming messaging system\nthat will be added to the marketplace. Dare we say that it is...right around the\ncorner? ?\n\nIn fact, it is now nearing completion, with the majority of the work in Particl\nDesktop being now completed. As it stands now, there are only a couple of issues\nthat still need to be addressed and one or two additional features that still\nneed to be implemented relating to the messaging. Still, those are minor\ncompared to the work that's already been done on that end.\n\nFor example, the ability to save a label, like a name or an identifier, to a\nparticular chat address still needs to be added to the desktop client; a feature\nthat should take no time to add. \n\nIn addition, there are still a couple of non-messaging issues that we've come\nacross that need to be looked at. By fixing these, along with the\nnow-quite-impressive number of improvements and bug fixes since our last desktop\nclient update, you can guess that Particl Desktop 3.2 is going to have a much\nbetter user experience and feel much smoother, especially for vendors who've\nsubmitted a non-negligible list of feedback, comments, and suggestions! Thank\nyou all for your constant reports; they help immensely in improving Particl!\n\nWith all of the above in mind, the focus for next week will be to complete all\nof the messaging-related changes (final desktop client implementation issues and\nfinal additional features) and do the final internal testing of the entirety of\nthe messaging implementation. We'll also strive to finish off the other\nnon-messaging issues. \n\nAnd so, we hope to be able to initiate the building process for Particl Desktop\n3.2 towards the end of next week or early into the following week. Regardless of\nwhen that process starts, expect a thorough update on the matter in next week's\nprogress report!\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've rebased the PartPayServer based on a request from a\npotential new partner to use the latest version of Particl Core. That means the\npayment server is now compatible with Taproot!\n\nFor those who don't know, PartPayServer is a payment module that can be\nintegrated into any website to accept both Bitcoin and Particl payments. The\npayment module can be integrated onto almost any website or platform or be added\nto any WooCommerce shop using the BtcPayServer plugin (cross-compatible with\nPartPayServer). \n\nIf you would like to accept Bitcoin or Particl payments on your website or\nonline shop (not hosted on Particl Marketplace), we recommend getting\nPartPayServer here [https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver].\n\nGitHub - tecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor.Accept Bitcoin payments. Free,\nopen-source & self-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor. - GitHub -\ntecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin pa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver]You'll find all the required\ndocumentation on setting it up here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver/blob/master/README.md]. Additionally,\nif you want to install and run the WooCommerce plugin, refer to this document \nhere [https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/]. Although the documentation is\nmade for BtcPayServer, PartPayServer is completely cross-compatible with the\nplugin and will work without issue. Just make sure to enable the Separate\nPayment Gateways setting to accept PART and get to the api key from btcpayserver\nby going to: Account -> Manage account -> api keys. It's listed in the next\nsection after automatically setting up the api key. Finally, for this to work,\nyou'll need to set up your own store and wallets in PartPayServer.\n\nAside from this rebase, the rest of the focus has gone towards keeping the\nParticl codebase up-to-date with Particl Core, as is usual.\n\nBroadcasting Lower Market Listing Fees\nAs most of you know, the size of the Particl Marketplace listing fees is\ndependent on what the network wishes to see. Anyone who stakes PART can\nbroadcast their fee preferences and influence the rate with which the\nmarketplace bases its listing fees.\n\nSince the fee broadcasting feature was fixed and re-enabled on our last\nhardfork, the community has lowered listing fees significantly. Indeed, we've\nseen a 66.6% decrease in listing fees, going from a target fee rate of 20,767 to \n6,935 at the time of this writing. So how does that translate into real-world\ndata? Let's check it out.\n\nFor this example, let's assume a seller sells 100 items over 30 days. He\naverages three high-quality images and a reasonable description length in each\nlisting. Thus, this example assumes an SMSG message size of around 0.5 MB. In\ntotal, after a month's worth of listing with PART's value set at $0.80), the\nseller would have paid $83.22 in total. Note that because there is no sales fee\nor any other eCommerce-related fee on the platform, that is all the seller will\npay, regardless if sales are made or not. However, the fiat valuation of the\nlisting fee does change depending on the PART price.\n\nWith this data on hand, now you're in a better position to judge whether or not\nyou want to broadcast lower or higher fee target rates. If you'd like to change\nyour preferences, we invite you to read the blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] and change your\npreferences accordingly!\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing FeesAdjust the Particl Marketplace listing fees\nusing your staking power.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Additionally, if you want to install and run the WooCommerce plugin, refer to this document <a href=\"https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/\"><strong>here</strong></a>. Although the documentation is made for BtcPayServer, PartPayServer is completely cross-compatible with the plugin and will work without issue. Just make sure to enable the <code class=\"language-text\">Separate Payment Gateways</code> setting to accept PART and get to the api key from btcpayserver by going to: <code class=\"language-text\">Account -> Manage account -> api keys</code>. It's listed in the next section after automatically setting up the api key.

Anyone who stakes PART can broadcast their fee preferences and influence the rate with which the marketplace bases its listing fees.</p><p>Since the fee broadcasting feature was fixed and re-enabled on our last hardfork, the community has lowered listing fees significantly. Indeed, we've seen a 66.6% decrease in listing fees, going from a target fee rate of <code class=\"language-text\">20,767</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">6,935</code> at the time of this writing. So how does that translate into real-world data? Let's check it out.</p><p>For this example, <strong>let's assume a seller sells 100 items over 30 days</strong>. He averages three high-quality images and a reasonable description length in each listing. Thus, this example assumes an SMSG message size of around 0.5 MB. In total, after a month's worth of listing with PART's value set at $0.80), <strong>the seller would have paid $83.22 in total</strong>. Note that because there is no sales fee or any other eCommerce-related fee on the platform, that is all the seller will pay, regardless if sales are made or not. However, the fiat valuation of the listing fee does change depending on the PART price.</p><p>With this data on hand, now you're in a better position to judge whether or not you want to broadcast lower or higher fee target rates.

This week, we've been trucking along the various components on\nour plate and have been making steady progress, bringing us closer to delivering\non some major items.\n\nLet's get into the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nWe're happy to announce that we have finished up the marketplace-related code\nfor the upcoming messaging system! What remains to be completed is the UI and\nthe integration into Particl Desktop, which is currently the main focus.\n\nIn the coming week, we'll likely be finishing up the UI changes for the\nOrders-related messaging and then also work towards finishing up the UI for the\nlisting-related messaging. \n\nAnd so, with that in mind, it is safe to say that the more challenging parts of\nthis significantly crucial new feature are now mostly done and behind us.\n\nAdditionally, we've been busy making minor fixes and improvements based on user\nfeedback. As such, Particl Desktop 3.2 is expected to run much more smoothly and\ninclude a wide variety of improvements to the desktop client and the marketplace\ncodebase. Again, thanks to all users taking the time to report bugs and feedback\nto the team; it is instrumental in making the product as good as possible!\n\n> Note: As is usual for any major Particl release, Particl Desktop 3.2 will be\nreleased on testnet prior to going live on mainnet. This will make it possible\nfor a larger pool of testers to play around with the new release and ensure that\nit remains stable under a wider range of environments.\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nThis week on core, we've completed all development and testing for the upcoming\nlight wallet Particl Electrum. \n\nHowever, within the last 24 hours, an upstream update to one of the packages\nrequired to build the Windows client received an upstream update that broke the\nprocess. This made building the Windows client not possible until some point\ntoday where it was fixed by the Electrum team\n[https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/commit/8559d1eb723c8c462c3d2a7365967ada46ef21c5]\n. With this issue now resolved, we will be able to launch the building process\nbefore the end of the day and release Particl Electrum once that is complete! \n\nThis is a great milestone for Particl because, as you may know by now,\nElectrum's back-end is intended to become a cornerstone of Particl's broader\naccessibility ambitions, notably by enabling Particl Marketplace and the\nBasicSwap DEX to be deployed on and accessed from the web.\n\nIn other words, using Particl Electrum as an end-user wallet is only scratching\nthe surface of what it's intended to be.\n\nAside from this, we've been pursuing the work mentioned in last week's update\nregarding BasicSwap and the merging of Bitcoin 23.0 into Particl Core, as is\nusual.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
