Today,\nwe're happy to share some of the deliverables we're exploring for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop releases.\n\n> Note: The items listed below are not set in stone. Some may be taken out and new\nitems may appear as we work on the upcoming releases.\nParticl Desktop 3.3.3\nThe most immediate desktop release will focus on minor fixes and items that were\nearmarked for it when development paused a few months ago.\n\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandonned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n * Investigate a potential problem with market identities and fix if issue is\n   found.\n * Investigate a potential issue with the editing functionality for Seller\n   Templates.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.4\nThe subsequent release will be almost exclusively focused on marketplace-related\nbug fixes and improvements. The goal with this update is to get the marketplace\nto a satisfactory level of stability and usability while we transition towards\nbuilding the new marketplace dApp.\n\n * Export Seller Templates to .csv file to easily migrate listings.\n * Allow for batch editing of listing details (i.e., shipping costs).\n * Improve publishing process of listings across different markets/identities.\n * Add an overriding functionality to the batch publish window.\n * Automate batch publishing (retries until all listings are successfully\n   published).\n * Add additional shipping options.\n * Allow Seller Templates to be sorted based on their attributes.\n * Increase character limit to listing description and titles.\n * Allow seller to delete or hide Seller Templates that aren't needed anymore.\n * Enable .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image files.\n\nParticl Desktop for TAILS OS\nAdditionally, we're exploring the requirements to make Particl Desktop\ncompatible with the hyper-private and amnesic TAILS Linux OS. While we have no\nspecific deliverables to announce regarding this, it seems likely that this will\nrequire a specific TAILS-focused version of Particl Desktop as it requires files\nto be managed differently so that it can work in conjunction with persistent\nmemory (i.e., storing required data like orders, Seller Templates, or the\nblockchain on a USB stick) more easily.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Here's a part of what we've worked\non this week:\n\n * Provide an alternative to secp256k1_clz64_var using HAVE_BUILTIN_CLZLL.\n * Add support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets.\n * Set the createoffers.py script's min_swap_amount variable to offer min bid\n   amount also (currently only used for bids).\n * Allow multiple signing keys to be tried with the basicswap-prepare script.\n * Set the state of expired bids to \"timed-out\".\n * \"Accept bid\" should be removed — like the \"abandon bid\" button — when not\n   it's not possible to accept (e.g., expired bid).\n\nUser Interface ?️\nThis week again, we've rolled out user interface updates to the dev branch which\nyou can now test.\n\nIf you would like to test these changes before they make it into the master \nbranch, you can change your active BasicSwap branch to the dev branch (using git\ncheckout dev) and updating BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nas you would typically do for a regular update.\n\nNotably, we've pushed changes to the way the order book is displayed that\nsimplify and make it more intuitive.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nWe're happy to announce that Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer has\nofficially resumed work on Particl Desktop as of this week.\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks, you can expect many changes to be pushed\nto Particl Desktop, which will culminate into the three major deliverables that\nwe've mentioned last week, namely Particl Desktop 3.3.3, Particl Desktop 3.4,\nand the required changes to make Particl Desktop compatible with the\nhyper-private and secure TAILS OS.\n\nHas work only resumed now, we will have more details on the progress being made\nto the below items next week.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3.3\nThe most immediate desktop release will focus on minor fixes and items that were\nearmarked for it when development paused a few months ago.\n\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandonned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n * Investigate a potential problem with market identities and fix if issue is\n   found.\n * Investigate a potential issue with the editing functionality for Seller\n   Templates.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.4\nThe subsequent release will be almost exclusively focused on marketplace-related\nbug fixes and improvements. The goal with this update is to get the marketplace\nto a satisfactory level of stability and usability while we transition towards\nbuilding the new marketplace dApp.\n\n * Export Seller Templates to .csv file to easily migrate listings.\n * Allow for batch editing of listing details (i.e., shipping costs).\n * Improve publishing process of listings across different markets/identities.\n * Add an overriding functionality to the batch publish window.\n * Automate batch publishing (retries until all listings are successfully\n   published).\n * Add additional shipping options.\n * Allow Seller Templates to be sorted based on their attributes.\n * Increase character limit to listing description and titles.\n * Allow seller to delete or hide Seller Templates that aren't needed anymore.\n * Enable .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image files.\n\nParticl Desktop for TAILS OS\nAdditionally, we're exploring the requirements to make Particl Desktop\ncompatible with the hyper-private and amnesic TAILS Linux OS. While we have no\nspecific deliverables to announce regarding this, it seems likely that this will\nrequire a specific TAILS-focused version of Particl Desktop as it requires files\nto be managed differently so that it can work in conjunction with persistent\nmemory (i.e., storing required data like orders, Seller Templates, or the\nblockchain on a USB stick) more easily.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
