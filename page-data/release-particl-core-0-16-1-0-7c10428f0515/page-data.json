We’ve got your back with our\nbi-weekly community and project update!\n\nThanks to our community member CryptoBeans for preparing most of the notes for\nthis update!\n\nLivestream Summary\nTeam Meetings\nTaking a break at the end of the day!Most of the core Particl developers met in\nPrague during the last week of June for a series of project meetings focused on\nthe planning and development of the roadmap items for the second half of the\nyear and moving forward. A particular focus was put on both the project and\nmarketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet\nfeature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed\nduring that time.\n\nTo conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer,\njoined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as\nan update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from\nthe community.\n\nProject & Marketplace Governance\nRyno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going\nto be integrated into the platform.\n\n * The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the\n   marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.\n * The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin\n   with and will evolve with time.\n * Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the\n   wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.\n * The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting\n   as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much\n   smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.\n * When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by\n   the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients\n   connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.\n * Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing\n   is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is\n   blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the\n   blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s\n   side.\n * When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the\n   vendor.\n * Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not\n   necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be.\n   The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the\n   governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace\n   governance model is planned for the Beta.\n * Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that\n   users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same\n   listing again.\n\nRingCT\nThere have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under\nacademic review for the last 6 months by assistant-professor Qiang Tang from\nthe\nNJIT Department of Technology [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/].\n\n * The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy\n   protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.\n * Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in\n   possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will\n   soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be\n   made available at that point.\n * The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their\n   research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nWeSecureApp * The WSA Cyber Group [https://wesecureapp.com/#] will then perform a full\n   RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the\n   RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require\n   around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline,\n   only a rough estimate.\n * While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &\n   CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet\n   implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not\n   only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still\n   very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe\n   there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be\n   considered safe enough for our users.\n\nMarketplace\nAs the Particl Marketplace Alpha\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] is still being improved\nand tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as\nwell as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.\n\n * Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion\n   on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be\n   added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the\n   messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to\n   store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli\n   but is not available in a graphical interface.\n * As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make\n   available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the designs from\n   our t-shirt contest winners\n   [https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5], to the\n   Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!\n * Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden\n   marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into\n   Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the\n   marketplace.\n * The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern\n   private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into\n   the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire\n   marketplaces (TBC).\n\nParticl Foundation\nDuring the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a\nParticl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course\nattended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions\nrelated to the Foundation.\n\n * The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second\n   or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the Particl\n   Foundation website [http://particl.foundation/financial-reports].\n * The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is\n   planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in\n   September 2018.\n\nLedger\nAs part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger\nwallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as\nwell as some other coins.\n\n * It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART,\n   however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for\n   advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s\n   interface.\n * Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.\n   [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482] \n   The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.\n * The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public\n   transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is\n   part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.\n\nOther Questions Asked During the Livestream\nThere are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community\nto both Ryno and Paul.\n\nRyno answering some of the Particl community questions * When asked where he\n   sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the\n   marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to\n   developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of\n   users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the\n   marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly\n   communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized\n   eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number,\n   talent, and experience.\n * When asked about other\n   dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is\n   in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated\n   about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally\n   enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny\n   auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.\n * Within the Particl\n   community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish\n   list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good\n   ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps,\n   gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (with one streaming dApp\n   allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member\n   [https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA]), and etc. One thing is for sure; the\n   idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to\n   dramatically improve several industries.\n * Ryno was asked about\n   the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of\n   the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts\n   of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as\n   the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is\n   now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl\n   developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile\n   methodologies are now also being put into practice, and two new development\n   managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired\n   [https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5]. It\n   was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for\n   issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are\n   now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s status\n   reports [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nBi-Weekly Recap\nThere is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have\nbeen quite eventful for the project.\n\nParticl Team is Expanding\nOn the 27th of June, we introduced 6 new team members\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5] \nincluding three managers and three developers. Carmen and Vivienne, our two new\ndevelopment managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our\norganizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new\ndevelopers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to\nspeed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!\n\nDuring last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer\nfor Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year.\nThis developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included\nin the 6 new team members blog post.\n\nPartaker Hub\nTop 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.The Partaker\nHub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of\ncontributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub\nis now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that it\nwas\nlaunched only three weeks ago\n[https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4].\n\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in\nspreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout\nto encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of\n146 tasks.\n\nDuring these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience\nfor all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and\nexperimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl\nmessage through organic word-of-mouth.\n\nAs such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be\nlinked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that\nusing and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the\nresults of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our\ncommunity to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more\ndetails about these new developments should be coming out soon.\n\nCommunity Meetup\nFollowing the week of meetings, the Particl team held a meetup\n[https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de] for\ncommunity members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks.\nThe meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague\nthat only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of\nour fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts)\nfrom TShirtPrinting [http://tshirtprinting.gr/], a long-time supporter of the\nproject, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and\noffering them as gifts!\n\nNew Particl Core Update\nYesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version\n(0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of\nalways staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase\nand is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience\nfor our users.\n\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will,\nhowever, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or\nParticl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core\nbut will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update\ncan be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract.\nNot updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but\nit is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl\nCore for security and stability reasons.\n\nNote that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will\nautomatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run.

A particular focus was put on both the project and marketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet feature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed during that time.</p><p>To conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer, joined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as an update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from the community.</p><h3 id=\"project-marketplace-governance\">Project &amp; Marketplace Governance</h3><p>Ryno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going to be integrated into the platform.</p><ul><li>The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.</li><li>The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin with and will evolve with time.</li><li>Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.</li><li>The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.</li><li>When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.</li><li>Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s side.</li><li>When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the vendor.</li><li>Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be. The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace governance model is planned for the Beta.</li><li>Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same listing again.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ringct\">RingCT</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-QeptxWMrevjZX2HigZVhhg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>There have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under academic review for the last 6 months by <a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/\">assistant-professor Qiang Tang from the NJIT Department of Technology</a>.</p><ul><li>The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.</li><li>Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be made available at that point.</li><li>The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-2AsxZ8uoxIj2CWNRb_p_Fw@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WeSecureApp</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://wesecureapp.com/#\">WSA Cyber Group</a> will then perform a full RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline, only a rough estimate.</li><li>While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &amp; CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be considered safe enough for our users.</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace\">Marketplace</h3><p>As the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Particl Marketplace Alpha</a> is still being improved and tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as well as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.</p><ul><li>Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli but is not available in a graphical interface.</li><li>As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5\">designs from our t-shirt contest winners</a>, to the Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!</li><li>Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the marketplace.</li><li>The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire marketplaces (TBC).</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-foundation\">Particl Foundation</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>During the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a Particl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course attended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions related to the Foundation.</p><ul><li>The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the <a href=\"http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\">Particl Foundation website</a>.</li><li>The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in September 2018.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ledger\">Ledger</h3><p>As part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger wallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as well as some other coins.</p><ul><li>It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART, however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s interface.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482\">Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.</a> The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.</li><li>The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.</li></ul><h3 id=\"other-questions-asked-during-the-livestream\">Other Questions Asked During the Livestream</h3><p>There are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community to both Ryno and Paul.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-rvUyAEMi_0RTxb8o3jg08g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Ryno answering some of the Particl community questions</figcaption></figure><ul><li>When asked where he sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number, talent, and experience.</li><li>When asked about other dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.</li><li>Within the Particl community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps, gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (<a href=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA\">with one streaming dApp allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member</a>), and etc. One thing is for sure; the idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to dramatically improve several industries.</li><li>Ryno was asked about the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile methodologies are now also being put into practice, and <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">two new development managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired</a>. It was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">status reports</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=\"bi-weekly-recap\">Bi-Weekly Recap</h2><p>There is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have been quite eventful for the project.</p><h3 id=\"particl-team-is-expanding\">Particl Team is Expanding</h3><p>On the 27th of June, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">we introduced 6 new team members</a> including three managers and three developers. Carmen and Vivienne, our two new development managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our organizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new developers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to speed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!</p><p>During last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer for Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year. This developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included in the 6 new team members blog post.</p><h3 id=\"partaker-hub\">Partaker Hub</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-hk3ogNBwA1tDap_t2WDTDw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Top 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.</figcaption></figure><p>The Partaker Hub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of contributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub is now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4\">it was launched only three weeks ago</a>.</p><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in spreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout to encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of 146 tasks.</p><p>During these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience for all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and experimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl message through organic word-of-mouth.</p><p>As such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be linked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that using and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the results of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our community to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more details about these new developments should be coming out soon.</p><h3 id=\"community-meetup\">Community Meetup</h3><p>Following the week of meetings, the Particl team <a href=\"https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de\">held a meetup</a> for community members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks. The meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague that only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of our fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts) from <a href=\"http://tshirtprinting.gr/\">TShirtPrinting</a>, a long-time supporter of the project, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and offering them as gifts!</p><h3 id=\"new-particl-core-update\">New Particl Core Update</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-Z9ugBVnUoCv5Uo-7z4xHiw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Yesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version (0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of always staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase and is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience for our users.</p><p>If you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will, however, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or Particl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core but will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update can be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract. Not updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but it is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl Core for security and stability reasons.</p><p>Note that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will automatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a version before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.</p><h3 id=\"new-official-blog-posts\">New Official Blog Posts</h3><p>There has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two weeks!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441\">First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">Particl welcomes 6 new team members!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66\">Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a\">PART now available for swapping on Mycelium</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515\">RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"new-cryptoramble-videos\">New CryptoRamble Videos</h3><p>Desi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only Particl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

There is now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers.

Carmen and Vivienne, our two new development managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our organizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new developers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to speed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!</p><p>During last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer for Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year.

We are still learning and experimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl message through organic word-of-mouth.</p><p>As such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be linked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that using and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the results of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our community to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more details about these new developments should be coming out soon.</p><h3 id=\"community-meetup\">Community Meetup</h3><p>Following the week of meetings, the Particl team <a href=\"https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de\">held a meetup</a> for community members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks. The meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague that only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of our fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts) from <a href=\"http://tshirtprinting.gr/\">TShirtPrinting</a>, a long-time supporter of the project, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and offering them as gifts!</p><h3 id=\"new-particl-core-update\">New Particl Core Update</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-Z9ugBVnUoCv5Uo-7z4xHiw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Yesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version (0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of always staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase and is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience for our users.</p><p>If you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will, however, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or Particl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core but will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update can be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract. Not updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but it is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl Core for security and stability reasons.</p><p>Note that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will automatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a version before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.</p><h3 id=\"new-official-blog-posts\">New Official Blog Posts</h3><p>There has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two weeks!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441\">First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">Particl welcomes 6 new team members!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66\">Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a\">PART now available for swapping on Mycelium</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515\">RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"new-cryptoramble-videos\">New CryptoRamble Videos</h3><p>Desi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only Particl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
