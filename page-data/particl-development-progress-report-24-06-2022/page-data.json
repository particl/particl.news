That's how it goes! This\nweek, we've been making progress on all fronts while maintaining the Particl\nDesktop 3.2.1 testnet round that's currently ongoing and working along the\nfeedback received from the community.\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump into the nitty gritty details of this week's\ndevelopment progress!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nTestnet Status ?\nShortly after the publication of last week's progress report, we released, on\ntestnet, the latest version of Particl Desktop (3.2.1). So far, we have received\nvery few reports of issues from the community. And so, the builds seem to be\nstable on the various environments that used to be problematic, which means\nwe'll be able to release it on mainnet within the next few days. Should there be\nany issue with the \n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 ?️\nAside from taking care of the current testnet round, most of the rest of the\nweek has been spent digging into the coming changes for Particl Desktop 3.3. \n\nAt this time, we're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts\nwith Particl Desktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when\nthe desktop client is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related\nupdates coming to Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nIndeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that\nmay be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be\nable to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to\nconfigure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor\nfrom the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already\nrunning core service.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

It\nchanges the code so that outputs will be marked as \"change only\" if the script\nthey're received on is derived from the internal key chain and the containing\ntransaction spends outputs from the wallet.\n\nBefore this fix, the only criteria was that the output script was from the\ninternal key chain, meaning if a transaction was sent from another wallet to an\ninternal key (path m/1/...), the receiving wallet would treat all the outputs as\n\"change\" despite not owning any of the inputs to the transaction. And because\nchange outputs are hidden in the output of some RPC functions, the transaction\nwould not show in listtransactions or listsinceblock without a debit entry. It\nwould, however, show in filtertransactions, but without output details.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've merged minor BasicSwap DEX improvements\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master] and have been working\nthrough the process of finalizing the first version of the GUI for the open beta\nphase before we run a final internal testing round. As always, we've been making\nsteady progress and haven't encountered many obstacles, although there is\nnothing specific or that stands out to be mentioned.

development progress\nreport arises! This week has been a busy one with two Particl Desktop releases\nand the important detailed announcement of BasicSwap, Particl's upcoming\nprivate, free, and unrestricted DEX.\n\nSo let's not wait any longer and get down to the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nDesktop Client Updates ✅\nThis week, we've released two Particl Desktop updates (3.2.1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1] and 3.2.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]). Both of these\ndesktop client updates are intended to fix bugs and improve the overall user\nimprovements with a few tweaks to the desktop client and marketplace dApp. \n\nNotably, Particl Desktop 3.2.2 fixes a particular bug that caused, in some\ncircumstances, listings and orders to not show up on some user's clients due to\nthe market service not being able to receive SMSG messages from Particl Core\nwhen offline. This is now resolved.\n\nBecause both of these clients fix a lot of issues, we strongly recommend\nupdating your desktop client as soon as you can so that you can benefit from the\nmost up-to-date Particl experience.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 ?️\nAs the two previously-mentioned Particl Desktop client updates occupied most of\nthis week's time, the work related to Particl Desktop 3.3 mentioned in last\nweek's development progress report is still ongoing.\n\n> We're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts with Particl\nDesktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when the desktop\nclient is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related updates coming\nto Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nIndeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that\nmay be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be\nable to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to\nconfigure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor\nfrom the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already\nrunning core service. — Quote from last week's progress report\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-24-06-2022/]\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track of\nthose changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAs we find ourselves in the final phase of BasicSwap's closed beta, we are\npreparing the ground for the open beta release. \n\nAs such, we've published an in-depth presentation of what BasicSwap is, what\nmakes it unique, what benefits you can draw from it, and how it's going to\nfoster a more private, free, and open financial system with no central point of\nfailure. Yes, we know this is a bold claim, but we completely own it and will\nlet BasicSwap speak for itself when it goes live. Stay tuned for more BasicSwap\nupdates coming very soon to Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]Aside from\nthis announcement, we've been running various tests and minor updates to\nBasicSwap, which will keep on going up until the release point.\n\nAs for the DEX's GUI, all of the independent modules and pages are now completed\nand we're in the final process of stitching everything together. This is the\nlast remaining part before we can start the last round of internal testing, and\nwe'll then be able to release the open beta publicly.\n\nUpdate on Marketplace Listing Fees\nBack in February, we proposed a hardfork that was accepted by stakers. This\nadded Taproot functionality into the Particl blockchain, but also fixed a bug\nwith the dynamic marketplace listing fee functionality.\n\nSince then, stakers have signaled to the network that they wanted lower SMSG\nfees, effectively massively reducing marketplace listing fees. We wanted to take\nthe opportunity, this week, to update you on what the current figures are.\n\nWhen Particl hardforked in February, the SMSG fee rate was standing at 20767.\nAfter a few months of signaling, it now stands at a mind-blowing 37!\n\nFor reference, we've polled a seller with ~300 listings on the marketplace and\nthey've stated that, in the past 30 days, they've only paid ~2.77 PART in\nlisting fees for the totality of their listings, listed every day.\n\nWithout applying any conclusion to the numbers above, we felt necessary to\nupdate the community on the current figures so that it can decide whether the\nfees should keep going down, stay as is, or be raised. As a reminder, this blog\npost [https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] explains, in\ndetail, how to signal your fee preference as a staker.\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing FeesAdjust the Particl Marketplace listing fees\nusing your staking power.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/]If anything, this\nshows that the bug fix back in February was successful and that the community\ncan now effectively and promptly adapt listing fees to any situation,\npreference, or need. This is a great news for the future of the platform and the\nnetwork's commitment to decentralized governance!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
