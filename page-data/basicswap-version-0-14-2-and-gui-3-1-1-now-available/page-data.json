we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMassive Update is Live ?\nBasicSwap Version 0.14.2 and GUI 3.1.1 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 3.1.1 user\ninterface and 0.14.2 codebase are now available, featuring a wide range of\nimprovements across the board.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-version-0-14-2-and-gui-3-1-1-now-available/]\nEarlier today, we've released a massive BasicSwap update that represents weeks\nof dedicated effort, incorporating numerous improvements, bug fixes, and new\nfeatures.\n\nAfter 112 commits from 6 different contributors, it welcomes Bitcoin Cash and\nimplements several key improvements across all aspects of the platform,\nincluding changes to the codebase, the user interface, and to individual coin\nintegrations such as Monero.\n\nNotably, a key technical change is the complete replacement of SQLAlchemy with\nmanbearpigSQL, our custom-built hybrid database system. This transition\nsimplifies BasicSwap's data management processes while solidifying security by\neliminating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis release took most of our time this week as we wrapped up several items for\nit. For more information and the full changelog, refer to the announcement blog\npost here\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-version-0-14-2-and-gui-3-1-1-now-available/].\n\nDogecoin Integration ?\nprobably nothing by nahuhh · Pull Request #175 · basicswap/basicswapGitHub\nbasicswap [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/175]Community contributor\nOfrnxmr has begun work on integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) into BasicSwap,\nindependent of today's update.\n\nWhile this might appear to be a straightforward integration, DOGE's legacy\ncodebase presents several technical challenges that we're currently working to\nresolve.\n\nWe'll continue to provide updates on the progress of this integration as\ndevelopment continues.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nAlthough not yet re-released, the installer release remains imminent. There are\nstill a few things to wrap up before the release, and we'll finish up those now\nthat the BasicSwap DEX update has gone live.\n\nHowever, we want to clarify that this installer is simply a convenience tool to\nfacilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on Windows. For Windows users, we\ncontinue to recommend using the Docker version, which remains our only\nofficially supported Windows implementation. We do not recommend running\nBasicSwap directly on Windows.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCodebase Improvement ?\nReplace sqlalchemy with manbearpigSQL · basicswap/basicswap@757f8f2Basic Atomic\nSwap Proof of Concept. Contribute to basicswap/basicswap development by\ncreating\nan account on GitHub.GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/757f8f27627048bd10703e9529effc36d715b379]\nThis week, aside from the usual bug fixes and general investigations, we've\nspent some time refactoring a large component of BasicSwap's codebase by\nremoving its dependency on sqlalchemy, and replacing it by a hybrid system\ncomposed of custom code and SQLlite\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/bd571702cb463090bc1b3c260842d7539438e43a] \n(tentatively named manbearpigSQL\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/757f8f27627048bd10703e9529effc36d715b379]\n).\n\nThis change aims at simplifying BasicSwap's database management processes and\nimproving security.\n\nAdditionally, we've pushed a series of other codebase improvements:\n\n * chainparams: Increase the minimum and maximum order sizes (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/28af80873ab4359533d87e4584af8e2fcb744217]\n   )\n * Fix a double bidding issue (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/165])\n * Fix connection reset problem (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/165])\n * (WIP) Currently fixing an issue with missing wallets page entries (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/01f6a1d8772d8d5288ccc01664c5e36c1e020244]\n   )\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've continued fixing bugs and making general improvements to the user\ninterface while working on some of the larger UI-related deliverables slated for\nthe next release.\n\nHere's a list of some of the changes that have been pushed to the dev branch\nthis week or that are still in pull requests waiting to be merged:\n\n * Refactor Javascript offers page (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/2e4be0274ac96dd11a55b1754c7909387b81e013]\n   )\n * Added filter for Expired/Revoked offers (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/2e4be0274ac96dd11a55b1754c7909387b81e013]\n   )\n * Other offer/order book related fixes (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/2e4be0274ac96dd11a55b1754c7909387b81e013]\n   )\n * Fixed Offers cache (1 [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/163])\n * Better filtering of the offer tables (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/163])\n * Hide function in Wallets now also hides cryptocurrency amounts (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/eb30ef22fc35b2afa127475e93b48a157a20fd40]\n   )\n * Added cache for USD prices (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/eb30ef22fc35b2afa127475e93b48a157a20fd40]\n   , 2 [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/164], 3\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/5db8d6ccbedbffa9e15c32c94c2bfa44d99f141e]\n   )\n * Added display of % change on total assets (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/eb30ef22fc35b2afa127475e93b48a157a20fd40]\n   )\n * Proper redirection to offer page after placing a bid (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/fa8764342ef32a2b15fb3a0b4d98b6b2a329cf24]\n   )\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nAlthough not yet re-released, the installer release remains imminent.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
