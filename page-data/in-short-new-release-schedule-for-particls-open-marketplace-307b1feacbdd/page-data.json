No new features is currently\nbeing implemented until the Alpha build is made entirely stable. Having a super\nstable build will make integrating new features on it much faster and easier and\nshould lead to more regular (and exciting) releases.\n\nThe Alpha Version Moves Up to Mainnet\nOnce the testnet Alpha version of the marketplace is fully stable and thoroughly\ntested, it will be moved up onto Particl’s mainnet, allowing you to purchase and\nsell real items using real PART coins. This milestone event will mark the end of\nthe Alpha phase of development and initiate the Beta phase.\n\nLimited Features\nThis first ever mainnet version of Particl’s Open Marketplace won’t require any\nsort of hardfork and will only contain a limited set of features. The features\navailable will be the same features that have been on testnet for some time.\nThis includes decentralized governance with coin weight, as well as the complete\nbuy and sell flow. Community proposals, although not directly a marketplace\nfeature, will also be live on mainnet.\n\nNo Privacy Enhancing Features in This Version\nIt’s very important to note that this mainnet version won’t be coupled with the\nRingCT hardfork yet, meaning that the MAD escrow system won’t be enhanced with\nit. This means that all marketplace transactions made on this version of the\nmarketplace will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is hardforked onto\nmainnet and integrated into the escrow system during Beta. You can rest assured,\nhowever, that no other data will be generated by the marketplace.\n\nThe Beta Phase Will be Focused on Adding New Features\nNew features will be introduced during the Beta phase and will be integrated\ninto existing testing builds as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nRelease Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of\nfeatures are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused on building the base layer for the marketplace, Beta\nwill be focused on integrating new features. A fully stable marketplace codebase\nwill result in quicker releases with something new to show for almost everytime,\nand it should also be a much more exciting phase for everyone than Alpha.\n\nBeta Starts as Soon as Alpha Ends\nThe Beta phase of development will start immediately after the Alpha phase is\ncompleted and moved onto mainnet. The next build that will follow the first\nmainnet version of the Open Marketplace will be a Beta build and will be\nreleased, like Alpha was up until the end, on testnet.\n\nTwo Development Branches Used During Beta\nDuring Beta, two types of branches, Development and Stable, will be used to push\ntestnet builds to the community.\n\nDevelopment Branch\n\nThe Development branch will be the first place where new features will be\navailable for community testing. Because introducing new features almost\ninevitably introduces bugs and issues, this may mean the Development branch\nmight not be super stable all the time. This is not ideal to get a good number\nof testers (if it’s broken all the time, people are less interested in testing\nthe builds) and to show friends. After all, what’s worse than showing a friend a\nbuild of Particl’s Open Marketplace only for it to crash in your face).\n\nStable Branch\n\nThis is where the Stable branch comes in. This branch will be used to push\nfeatures that have already went through a good number of tests and that have\nbeen fixed of most bugs and issues. While the Stable branch is still a testnet\nbranch, it will make builds much more stable and easy to share with friends.\nThis branch is the final step before a feature is introduced onto mainnet.\n\nA Feature’s Path to Mainnet\nWith this new strategy, a feature now has to go through one additional hoop\nbefore being implemented on mainnet. It first needs to be tested internally by\nthe team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of\nmost of its bugs and issues, the feature gets implemented onto the Stable branch\nfor its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be\nintegrated onto mainnet.\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nThis mainnet release marks an important milestone for Particl. It separates it\nfrom the group forming the majority of blockchain projects that do not have any\nsort of product ready at this time and gives it an entry ticket into a much more\nlimited category of projects that have a product live on mainnet. What’s more,\nit will signify the beginning of a brand new phase for the project and the\ncommunity as it will now be easier than ever to spend cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

To make all of this a reality, the Particl developers have been\nproducing a lot of high-quality code, earning the team a spot within the top\ntiers of several Github audit reports/reviews\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAll of these achievements are surely impressive, especially coming from a team\nthat’s relatively quite small compared to other projects producing similar\namount [http://coincodecap.com] and quality of code (a look at the contributors\nsection of this code quality ranking [http://coincodecap.com] tells everything\nyou need to know). But what this story fails to mention is that none of the\naccomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the\nproject, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product. In\nfact, all of them exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the security,\nprivacy, stability, and scalability of the network in prevision for the mainnet\nrelease of Particl’s first application: the Open Marketplace.\n\nThe Open Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is a product that’s been in the making for quite some time\nand has proven to be a huge undertaking due to its extremely ambitious nature.\n\nIn short, it is an entirely trustless marketplace with full privacy baked in by\ndefault and with almost no fee at all. The fact that it is trustless means that\nit can function autonomously and without any third-party having to get involved\nat any point in time. This allows fees to be brought down to the bare minimum\nand completely eliminates the trust factor involved when making online sales and\npurchases.\n\nIts privacy aspect, which probably is the most groundbreaking aspect of the Open\nMarketplace, makes it so that all purchases and sales you make are verifiably\nprivate/anonymous. Whatever you do within the platform generates no identifiable\ndata at all, meaning that it can’t be harvested by Particl or any other\nthird-party other than the one you are transacting with. In other words, nothing\nyou do on Particl’s Open Marketplace can leave any trace behind.\n\nThis privacy aspect truly is a revolution within the eCommerce industry, an\nindustry that has made its fortune preying on its own users by collecting their\ndata, without their consent, in order to get profits and influence.\n\nThe simple fact that no other project has ever attempted to build a completely\ntrustless marketplace with rock solid privacy built directly at its core speaks\nabout the complexity of the task. Being the first at doing something also means\nvery few examples and proofs-of-concept are out there to help pave the way\nforward, but it also means that you can create a niche audience around your “new\nway” and capitalize on it!\n\nEven though a lot of development progress has been made to the Open Marketplace\nin 2018, the fact it has only been operable on testnet for the entire year has\nmade people more eager than ever to see some kind of mainnet release and finally\nget their hands on a working version of this groundbreaking technology.\n\nMainnet is Finally Upon Us!\nThe days where the Open Marketplace is only available as a testnet product are\ncoming to an end. We’ve stated in the past we wanted this year to be different\nin nature from the previous one, and so let’s start it with a bang! Whereas 2018\nwas solely focused on development, 2019 will see much more action with the\nrelease of the Open Marketplace on mainnet. The best part? The mainnet release\nof the Alpha version of Particl’s Open Marketplace is now imminent!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Timeline\nAs stated in an answer\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-1-fe6a3f3014c2#3a6d] to a\nquestion asked during our latest AMA/FAQ session, one of the decisions the\nParticl team has taken in South Africa has been to focus on making the current\nAlpha version of the marketplace completely stable and move it onto mainnet as\nsoon as that stability is reached. In other words, in just a short time, it will\nfinally be possible to buy and sell real goods and services on Particl’s Open\nMarketplace and do it with real coins!\n\nAlpha Development Phase Ends and Releases on Mainnet\nThe current Alpha version contains all the necessary tools for basic eCommerce\nto be possible, including weighted decentralized governance to keep it clean\n(which is currently available internally, but is not merged on public testnet\njust yet). Once Alpha is successfully moved onto mainnet, it will mark the end\nof the Alpha period for the Open Marketplace and the beginning of the Beta\nphase.\n\nAlpha Mainnet Features\nIf you’ve played with recent versions of the marketplace on testnet, then you\nwill find yourself within a familiar environment when running it on mainnet. All\nof the features introduced throughout the year on testnet will now be available,\nand very stable, within a real-life environment. There is no better way to test\nfeatures, especially those relying on game-theory such as the MAD escrow and the\ndecentralized governance mechanism, than to put them into the wild where real\nfunds and incentives are involved.\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that, as the current switch from testnet\nto mainnet won’t require any sort of hardfork, the first mainnet version of the\nOpen Marketplace won’t process transactions using Particl’s RingCT protocol \nwhich will stay on testnet for the time being. What this means is that \nmarketplace transactions will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is\nfully implemented into the escrow system at some point in time during Beta’s\ndevelopment phase.\n\nThe mainnet version of the Open Marketplace Alpha will contain these features:\n\n * Buy and sell real products and services with real coins\n * Trustless and fee-less escrow mechanism without RingCT privacy\n * Decentralized governance mechanism to flag listings\n * Community proposals\n\nBeta Development Phase Begins Soon (Testnet)\nWhile the Alpha mainnet version of the marketplace will allow anyone in the\nworld to buy and sell real goods and services using real coins, it will only\ninclude the basic functions that make eCommerce possible. The Beta phase of\ndevelopment, which will run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version, is aimed at\nbuilding the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce\nexperience and slowly integrating them as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nThis phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for\nthe marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features. For this reason,\nBeta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact\nthat every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of\nthe features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta\nphase:\n\n * Inventory management\n * Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)\n * Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging\n   will likely be integrated in more than one way)\n * Private markets (or “Bubbles)\n * Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)\n * Escrow recovery and refunds\n * A section for wanted items\n * Shipping carrier integration\n * …and more (click here)!\n   [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a]\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n> Note: The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon\nas the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each\nnew Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release\nCandidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features\nare not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\nBranching Off\nAs discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see\nits development be split into two branches: the Development branch, and the\nStable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will\nmake testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds\neasier to share with friends.\n\nThe Development branch will be where all the newly introduced features first get\nadded. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues,\nthis simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super\nstable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but\nis necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly\nby the more advanced types of user.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, a new branch, the Stable branch, will be introduced\nwhere only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to\nhave a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also\nhave all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features\nthat will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed\nthrough the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much\nmore enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing\nwith other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).\n\nIn simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it\nwill first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the\nrougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the\nfeature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of\ntesting. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto\nmainnet and able to be used with real funds.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nIt would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace\non mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project\nand the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by\neveryone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the\neCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data\nand shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to\noffer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless,\nprivate-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can\nparticipate.\n\nWhat’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to\nspend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire\ncryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No\nmore will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to\nbuy stuff with crypto.\n\nThis release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of\nblockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at\nthis time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group\nof projects that have a product live on mainnet!\n\nWhile this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the\nfirst full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably\nfunctioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real\ncrypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the\nproject on all angles.\n\nWe cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you\nand watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

It was the first blockchain to <strong>natively integrate Segwit</strong> and have it enabled for all of its transactions, the first project to integrate <strong>RingCT</strong> on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote), the first project to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\">implement </a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\"><strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d\"> on Bitcoin’s codebase</a> and push it onto mainnet, the first project to <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34\">implement </a><a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-november-19th-2017-f51dd5443c34\"><strong>cold staking</strong></a> for its entire mainnet network, and the first project to enable a true PoS (not <a href=\"https://www.mycryptopedia.com/delegated-proof-stake-dpos-explained/\">dPoS</a> or <a href=\"https://thebitcoinnews.com/what-is-delegated-byzantine-fault-tolerance/\">dBFT</a>) coin to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>safely cold stake from a hardware device</strong></a> (Ledger Nano S). To make all of this a reality, the Particl developers have been producing a lot of high-quality code, earning the team a spot within the top tiers of <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9\">several Github audit reports/reviews</a>.</p><p>All of these achievements are surely impressive, especially coming from a <a href=\"http://coincodecap.com\">team that’s relatively quite small compared to other projects producing similar amount</a> and quality of code (a look at the contributors section of <a href=\"http://coincodecap.com\">this code quality ranking</a> tells everything you need to know). But what this story fails to mention is that none of the accomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the project, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product. In fact, all of them exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the security, privacy, stability, and scalability of the network in prevision for the <strong>mainnet release</strong> of Particl’s first application: the Open Marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"the-open-marketplace\">The Open Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-NK_QEHjFX4l0rjIwuXfaoA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Open Marketplace is a product that’s been in the making for quite some time and has proven to be a huge undertaking due to its extremely ambitious nature.</p><p>In short, it is an <strong>entirely trustless marketplace with full privacy baked in by default and with almost no fee at all</strong>. The fact that it is trustless means that it can function autonomously and without any third-party having to get involved at any point in time. This allows fees to be brought down to the bare minimum and completely eliminates the trust factor involved when making online sales and purchases.</p><p>Its privacy aspect, which probably is the most groundbreaking aspect of the Open Marketplace, makes it so that all purchases and sales you make are verifiably private/anonymous.

We’ve stated in the past we wanted this year to be different in nature from the previous one, and so let’s start it with a bang! Whereas 2018 was solely focused on development, 2019 will see much more action with the release of the Open Marketplace on mainnet. The best part? <strong>The mainnet release of the Alpha version of Particl’s Open Marketplace is now imminent!</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"the-timeline\">The Timeline</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-CG1uULpg0YcDHmdA3af8dQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As stated in an <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-1-fe6a3f3014c2#3a6d\"><strong>answer</strong></a> to a question asked during our latest AMA/FAQ session, one of the decisions the Particl team has taken in South Africa has been to focus on making the current Alpha version of the marketplace completely stable and move it onto mainnet as soon as that stability is reached. In other words, in just a short time, it will finally be possible to <strong>buy and sell real goods and services </strong>on Particl’s Open Marketplace and do it with <strong>real coins</strong>!</p><h3 id=\"alpha-development-phase-ends-and-releases-on-mainnet\">Alpha Development Phase Ends and Releases on Mainnet</h3><p>The current Alpha version contains all the necessary tools for basic eCommerce to be possible, including weighted decentralized governance to keep it clean (which is currently available internally, but is not merged on public testnet just yet). Once Alpha is successfully moved onto mainnet, it will mark the end of the Alpha period for the Open Marketplace and the beginning of the Beta phase.</p><h3 id=\"alpha-mainnet-features\">Alpha Mainnet Features</h3><p>If you’ve played with recent versions of the marketplace on testnet, then you will find yourself within a familiar environment when running it on mainnet. All of the features introduced throughout the year on testnet will now be available, and very stable, within a real-life environment. There is no better way to test features, especially those relying on game-theory such as the MAD escrow and the decentralized governance mechanism, than to put them into the wild where real funds and incentives are involved.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that, as the current switch from testnet to mainnet <strong>won’t require any sort of hardfork</strong>, the first mainnet version of the Open Marketplace<strong> won’t process transactions using Particl’s RingCT protocol</strong> which will stay on testnet for the time being. What this means is that <strong>marketplace transactions will be pseudonymous, not anonymous</strong>, until RingCT is fully implemented into the escrow system at some point in time during Beta’s development phase.</p><p>The mainnet version of the Open Marketplace Alpha will contain these features:</p><ul><li>Buy and sell real products and services with real coins</li><li>Trustless and fee-less escrow mechanism <strong>without RingCT privacy</strong></li><li>Decentralized governance mechanism to flag listings</li><li>Community proposals</li></ul><h3 id=\"beta-development-phase-begins-soon-testnet-\">Beta Development Phase Begins Soon (Testnet)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Release-Schedule-for-Particl-s-Open-Marketplace/1-wjnOCuj7RO9udfXb_PWj4A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>While the Alpha mainnet version of the marketplace will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell real goods and services using real coins, it will only include the basic functions that make eCommerce possible. The Beta phase of development, which will <strong>run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version</strong>, is aimed at building the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce experience and slowly integrating them as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate\"><strong>Release Candidates</strong></a>. This phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!</p><p><strong>Whereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for the marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features.</strong> For this reason, Beta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact that every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of the features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta phase:</p><ul><li>Inventory management</li><li>Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)</li><li>Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging will likely be integrated in more than one way)</li><li>Private markets (or “Bubbles)</li><li>Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)</li><li>Escrow recovery and refunds</li><li>A section for wanted items</li><li>Shipping carrier integration</li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a\"><strong>…and more (click here)!</strong></a></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon as the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each new Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"branching-off\">Branching Off</h3><p>As discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see its development be <strong>split into two branches</strong>: the Development branch, and the Stable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will make testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds easier to share with friends.</p><p>The <strong>Development branch</strong> will be where all the newly introduced features first get added. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues, this simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super stable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but is necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly by the more advanced types of user.</p><p>For the sake of convenience, a new branch, the <strong>Stable branch</strong>, will be introduced where only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to have a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also have all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features that will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed through the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much more enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing with other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).</p><p>In simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it will first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the feature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto mainnet and able to be used with real funds.</p><hr><h2 id=\"biggest-milestone-to-date\">Biggest Milestone to Date</h2><p>It would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace on mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project and the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by everyone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the eCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data and shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to offer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless, private-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can participate.</p><p>What’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to spend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire cryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No more will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to buy stuff with crypto.</p><p>This release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of blockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at this time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group of projects that have a product live on mainnet!</p><p>While this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the first full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably functioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real crypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the project on all angles.</p><p>We cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you and watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!</p><hr><p>Want to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious eCommerce in general?

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
