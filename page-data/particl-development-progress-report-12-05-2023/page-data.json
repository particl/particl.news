that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nEarlier in the week, we pushed the new version of Particl Core to Particl\nDesktop, meaning that your client will now automatically download the most\nrecent version the next time you launch it.\n\nIf your Particl Desktop is currently running, you can trigger the update by\nshutting it down and launching it again.\n\nOther than that, we're still completing the items outlined in our previous\nupdates, namely including enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety\nof minor improvements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay in the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCommits · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]Early in the week, we\nidentified a rare scenario where a malicious user could manipulate the protocol\nto abandon swaps mid-process. While this situation doesn't pose a risk of loss\nof funds, it could adversely affect user experience by leading participants into\nswaps destined to fail. We have promptly fixed this issue.\n\nYou can find the fix, as well as other updates to the BasicSwap protocol,\ndirectly on its Github page here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've made several improvements and tweaks to the user interface, thanks to\nvaluable community feedback, which are ready to go live any day from now. While\nthe merge still hasn't happened, you can expect GUI v2.0.2 to be deployed\nsomewhere next week.\n\nHere are a few notable improvements featured in v2.0.2:\n\n * Enhanced display and usage of swap rates.\n * Tooltips when hovering over specific areas.\n * Enhanced bid-related pages, including the addition of a button to open swap\n   details as opposed to clicking on the bid's hash, improved display of bid and\n   swap statuses, and more.\n * Persistent filters in the order book and bid/offer pages.\n * Improved information display in the \"Create New Offer\" page.\n\nThese updates aim to create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Stay\ntuned for the launch!\n\nCoin Integrations ?\nWe are currently exploring the possibility of introducing new coins to BasicSwap\nin the near future. This initiative is a follow-up to some of our discussions at\nMonerotopia, where we connected with several teams and individuals about\nintegrating their coin or protocol into BasicSwap.\n\nHowever, as each coin integration requires individual attention and can be\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive for all parties involved, we cannot\nprovide specific timelines or commitments at this stage.\n\nAs always, we will take care of informing you as soon as new coins are ready for\ndeployment.\n\nWeb Framework ?\nWe are currently developing a web framework intended to make BasicSwap\naccessible via the web. This is a complex task, as the DEX must be largely\nre-imagined and rebuilt to offer a fitting web experience.\n\nThe deployment of such a platform presents various challenges, both technical\nand user-experience related, that makes it architecturally more intricate, but\nalso more accessible to the end-user, than a local installation.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, the first iteration of a web version of the\nDEX is designed to be more of a quick exchange platform, similar to the\nExodus/SimpleSwap flow type. Our goal is to avoid requiring users to deposit any\ncoins into a persistent web wallet, enhancing both security and usability.\nHowever, due to the nature of atomic swaps, this approach necessitates that swap\ncontracts be pre-signed and that users send coins directly into these contracts.\nThis represents a completely different approach and a more complex flow compared\nto BasicSwap's current local architecture, but it also opens the door to\nfeatures not readily available on a local installation.\n\nFor this reason, we anticipate that the local and web versions of BasicSwap will\ndiverge significantly, each presenting unique advantages, trade-offs, and\nspecific feature sets. This expanded choice aligns with Particl's mission by\nenhancing user flexibility, enabling them to select the platform that most\nclosely aligns with their needs without forcing compromises on the BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol itself. It's the best of both worlds!\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, developing this web framework will take\nconsiderable time, owing to both its development requirements and the need for\nrigourous testing before deployment. \n\nAt the moment, Particl developers Kewde and Tecnovert are working on this task.\nUpdates on its progress may not be regular, but it is now a major focus moving\nforward, so we will ensure you are informed when significant milestones are\nachieved. Your patience and support in this initiative are greatly appreciated;\nwe are convinced that this is a major part of what needs to happen for BasicSwap\nto take off as an end-user product.\n\nUpcoming Overhaul of Particl.io ?\nAs noted in some of our previous progress updates, we're also working on a new\nversion of the Particl.io website. \n\nWhile we continue to focus on various aspects of the project at the same time,\nwe're still making consistent progress towards getting the new website ready for\nlaunch. \n\nWe expect the revamped website to be ready for deployment relatively soon,\nalthough it is still a bit too early to commit to more precise timelines. So\nstay tuned for further updates on that front!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving. None of it would be possible without you\nall!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend we'll see you all back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
