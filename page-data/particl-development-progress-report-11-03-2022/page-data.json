This week has been a continuation of the various components being worked\non with steady progress being made on all fronts.\n\nLet's jump right into the crux of this update!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, good progress has been made on the marketplace messaging system. As a\nreminder, this system allows for two transacting parties (the buyer and the\nseller) to communicate at any point in time during a transaction. This is the\nlast remaining item before Particl Desktop 3.2 is ready to be released and is\nthe current primary focus of Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer.\n\nAdditionally, two issues that were reported by current active users of the\nmarketplace have been resolved. They are as follows.\n\n 1. Fixing the removal/deleting of images from a template in the marketplace.\n    This issue has been successfully resolved.\n 2. The very first startup of PD at times failed to save the relevant\n    configuration to the core particl.conf file, and then would have all the\n    changes written to the particl.conf on the on 2nd startup. This would result\n    in a potential reindex of the blockchain on the 2nd startup and possible\n    issues on that first use of PD/particl-core.\n\nGoing into next week, working on the messaging system will remain the primary\nfocus as we head towards the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nWhen it comes to Particl Core, a lot of work has gone into merging all the\nlatest changes made to Bitcoin 23.0 into Particl. This is an ever-ongoing task\nand you can follow the progress at any point in time by monitoring the Particl\nCore repository on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nCommits · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute\nto particl/particl-core development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]Aside from that,\nsignificant progress has been made on Particl Electrum with cold staking and\ncold staking pools now being successfully integrated. We are currently testing\nthe client extensively to ensure the integration works as intended. \n\nAdditionally, a few general improvements over the original Electrum codebase\nhave been added in, notably as we intend to use Particl Electrum as the back-end\nfor many of what we have planned moving forward (i.e., web or mobile framework). \n\nNote that, if you prefer using Particl on your mobile device, you'll be happy to\nknow that Particl Electrum comes along with a mobile application. And while its\nupstream interface is rather basic, we'd like to remind you that the primary\ncenter of interest here when it comes to Particl Electrum is the back-end\ncapabilities that it provides. As such and moving forward, its codebase will\nallow for the development of better mobile applications based on it, which could\nserve as solid replacements for the current Particl Copay application.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below.

weekly progress report.\nThis week has once again been a continuation of the various components being\nworked on with steady progress being made on all fronts.\n\nWithout further ado, let's jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, the upcoming marketplace messaging system that allows buyers and\nsellers to message each other has been the sole focus. While progress may seem\nslow on that end, it is steady, and we can report that the main hurdles are\nlikely now out of the way.\n\nNext week, we'll be making some related changes to the marketplace codebase and\nputting more focus and emphasis on the UI component of this messaging system.\n\nThe in-market messaging layer is currently the main focus and the last remaining\nmajor item before we can go live with the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nParticl's upcoming light wallet, Particl Electrum, is currently in its last\ntesting phase. We can report that no major issue has been encountered so far\nsince we've started this final round of testing; it's been smooth sailing, and\nthat is an excellent indicator. Particl Electrum should be ready to be released\nnext week!\n\nAs for BasicSwap, we are making outstanding progress both on its user interface\nand codebase. Indeed, we're currently improving various aspects of the codebase\nbut, perhaps more interesting for this update, adding Tor functionality to it as\nwell.\n\nIndeed, once initially released, it will be possible to launch BasicSwap and\nroute it either through \"clearnet\" or through Tor. Furthermore, this option is\navailable right from within the installation process. That means you won't have\nto launch BasicSwap first to adjust this setting, allowing you to avoid\ndeploying your node on either clearnet or Tor if you need to avoid doing so\n(i.e., in some countries, you may want to avoid simply connecting to the Tor\nnetwork).\n\nAbout the user interface, we fully intend on making it as user-friendly as\npossible so that most people can get started quickly and reap its benefits\nwithout needing to be an \"advanced user\". This is a common mistake with\ncross-chain DEXes that often leads to a lack of adoption. To that end, we are\nworking on making the user interface expand on BasicSwap's core functions and\nbring the user experience to a level more similar to what you would expect from\n\"traditional exchanges\". \n\nWe'd also like to mention that, even though we are calling this upcoming launch\nan \"open beta\", the release will be fully functional and let you easily swap\nassets like Bitcoin, Monero, and Particl on their respective mainnet networks.\nDon't be fooled by the \"beta\" status of BasicSwap; we are calling it this way\nbecause we have a much broader vision for it going into the future. Its first\nbeta release should already be smooth enough to become your go-to exchange.\n\nFinally, we've also made good progress on bringing the Particl code up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin's latest version (23.0), and we should have a release ready for it,\nwith the new guix framework, quite soon. As always, this is an ever-ongoing task\nbut still requires a fair amount of effort every week.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below.

In this week's report, we're providing a bit more information about the\nupcoming BasicSwap DEX and its open beta release timeline, so if you had\ninterrogations about it, be sure not to miss this section!\n\nWithout further ado, let's jump right in. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've wrapped up the new product code functionality which gives the\nability for sellers to better categorize and update their products.\n\nIt allows for a seller to uniquely identify their items according to their own\npredefined system. Note that this has no impact on the buyer side as the product\ncodes are not publicly displayed along with a listing; they simply exist to\nprovide some assistance to sellers in terms of inventory management. It will\nalso allow us to introduce, in the future, additional features to provide more\nthorough product updates via CSV import or alternative methods using product\ncodes as unique identifiers.\n\nOther than that, we've applied a few UI improvements to Particl Desktop, both on\nthe marketplace and desktop apps, as was suggested by current vendors.\n\nGoing into next week, the in-market messaging system (buyer - seller inbox) will\nbe the sole priority and we expect to wrap it up soon, after which Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release.\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've dealt with a tricky issue regarding integrating cold\nstaking and cold staking pools into the upcoming Particl Electrum wallet. This\nissue is still being actively resolved and is the current main focus at this\ntime for Particl's core developer Tecnovert.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Progress Update\nWe've received a few questions this week regarding Particl's upcoming\ncross-chain and private DEX; BasicSwap. As mentioned previously, we are\ncurrently working on the user interface of the protocol. This is the last\nremaining item before its open beta is ready to be released, but it's a critical\none nonetheless as it will largely contribute to the first impression people\nwill have about it. That's twice as true for any user that isn't currently a\nParticl community member (and we absolutely want to welcome them as part of our\nawesome community). That's the reason why we want to spend the proper time to\nensure that the user interface is as optimal and simple to use as possible.\n\nIndeed, in the last few years, we've seen many attempts at decentralized\nexchanges. One of the most recurring reasons why some of them do not see great\nsuccess is because they are too complicated to use for the \"common user\". \n\nTurns out, simplicity is one of BasicSwap's strengths. Indeed, it doesn't\nrequire any complicated terminal operations to function (other than the initial\nsetup, which is only temporary until proper builds are released), and all\nfeatures and functions are fully accessible from a web browser (even though it's\nstill a local application). \n\nBut to reach its full potential, it needs to be properly supported by a simple\nyet powerful user interface. And because the sheer number of features and\noptions available can get confusing for the casual crypto user; we're taking\ngreat care of building an easy-to-use but also eye-candy user interface. After\nall, we do not want to limit our user base to the technically advanced and\ngeeks; we want any crypto user to be able to benefit from a private,\ndecentralized, and no BS trading exchange that's not after their money or data. \n\nIt's important, however, to keep in mind that the first version of BasicSwap\n(its open beta) is only the first step towards a more ambitious goal. Although\nwe are confident that the open beta itself, which will run on mainnet, will\ngather a good number of users on its own, the real game-changer comes once we\nsuccessfully complete a more flexible framework we're working on.\n\nIndeed, we are working, right at this moment, on a flexible framework that would\nmake it easier for anyone to leverage the BasicSwap protocol and deploy the\nsystem on other platforms (i.e., Particl Desktop, a website, cryptocurrency\nwallets, etc). Once that is complete, that's when we expect BasicSwap to really\nshine and be integrated by partners and other players within the blockchain\nindustry. That's directly in line with our inclusive and non-tribalistic\napproach; a decentralized, free (as in freedom), and private ecosystem built for\nthe benefit of all.\n\nBut as for the progress being made on the user interface of the open beta\nitself, we have been making very good progress on it specifically within the\npast two weeks. We can confirm it is the current main focus of Particl designer\nGerlof van Ek and we expect to be able to start teasing the UI soon enough.\n\nKeep an eye out for any update on Particl News as BasicSwap is the next big\nthing to attach itself to the Particl ecosystem. We are inching closer than even\nto become 100% unstoppable! \n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nHave you tuned in to the Super Dangerous Club yet?

As mentioned previously, we are currently working on the user interface of the protocol. This is the last remaining item before its open beta is ready to be released, but it's a critical one nonetheless as it will largely contribute to the first impression people will have about it. That's twice as true for any user that isn't currently a Particl community member (and we absolutely want to welcome them as part of our awesome community). That's the reason why we want to spend the proper time to ensure that the user interface is as optimal and simple to use as possible.</p><p>Indeed, in the last few years, we've seen many attempts at decentralized exchanges. One of the most recurring reasons why some of them do not see great success is because they are too complicated to use for the \"common user\". </p><p>Turns out, simplicity is one of BasicSwap's strengths. Indeed, it doesn't require any complicated terminal operations to function (other than the initial setup, which is only temporary until proper builds are released), and all features and functions are fully accessible from a web browser (even though it's still a local application). </p><p>But to reach its full potential, it needs to be properly supported by a simple yet powerful user interface. And because the sheer number of features and options available can get confusing for the casual crypto user; we're taking great care of building an easy-to-use but also eye-candy user interface. After all, we do not want to limit our user base to the technically advanced and geeks; we want any crypto user to be able to benefit from a private, decentralized, and no BS trading exchange that's not after their money or data. </p><p>It's important, however, to keep in mind that the first version of BasicSwap (its open beta) is only the first step towards a more ambitious goal. Although we are confident that the open beta itself, which will run on mainnet, will gather a good number of users on its own, the real game-changer comes once we successfully complete a more flexible framework we're working on.</p><p>Indeed, we are working, right at this moment, on a flexible framework that would make it easier for anyone to leverage the BasicSwap protocol and deploy the system on other platforms (i.e., Particl Desktop, a website, cryptocurrency wallets, etc). Once that is complete, that's when we expect BasicSwap to really shine and be integrated by partners and other players within the blockchain industry. That's directly in line with our inclusive and non-tribalistic approach; a decentralized, free (as in freedom), and private ecosystem built for the benefit of all.</p><p>But as for the progress being made on the user interface of the open beta itself, we have been making very good progress on it specifically within the past two weeks.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
