This team proposal is just one example of what anyone can\npropose to Particl stakeholders.\nTable of Contents\n * Progress Since the First Funding Request\n * The Funding Request in Details\n * Vision and Development Priorities\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Since the First Funding Request\nAbout 6 months ago, the Particl team started drawing funds from the treasury\nafter its first funding request was approved by Particl stakeholders. Since that\ntime, we’ve worked on improving and expanding the ecosystem with various\nimprovements and additions. \n\nHere’s a brief list of what we’ve done since being granted funds from the\ntreasury.\n\n * Particl V3 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/])\n * Particl V3.1 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/])\n * Announce BasicSwap, a cross-chain and private DEX, and prep it for its open\n   beta (learn more [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/])\n * New Particl.io website (check it out [https://particl.io/])\n * New roadmap (check it out [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/])\n * Published our short to mid-term marketing plans (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/])\n * 10 Particl Core releases, including 0.21.x.x pre-releases (learn more\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Scheduled a new hardfork to fully activate Taproot (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/])\n * Particl Electrum wallet with Lightning Network support (work-in-progress\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-10-09-2021#particl-core-development-report]\n   )\n * New legal entity formed to support the project\n\nRoadmap Progress\nAside from the project-wide milestones mentioned above, we’ve also made great\ndevelopment progress. Here are the roadmap items we’ve completed or made\nprogress to during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We announced that we would be releasing a new app into the Particl\necosystem; BasicSwap. BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange (DEX) protocol that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another\nwithout any middleman or third-party being involved. It is currently in closed\nbeta; its open beta is expected to begin very shortly in early 2022. \n\nWeb framework Although we haven’t officially communicated on this yet, we’ve\nmade preliminary progress in building certain aspects of what will allow Particl\napps, like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap, to be accessible from the web. We\nwill be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are\nlikely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at\nonce. We’ll have more information to share a bit later on. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality We’ve released an update to the cold staking zap\nfunctionality that allows for more a granular management of the zapping process.\nThe process has been optimized and made more private. You can also now choose\nbetween two zapping options; optimized for staking or optimized for privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Although not yet released, we’ve worked on a new light wallet\nfor Particl: Particl Electrum. It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum\nwallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need\nto sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in\nsome of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides\n\"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the\nblockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the\nLightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to\nParticl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment. \n\nTaproot Support In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the\nlong-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new\nfeatures and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/]. \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import/management We added to Particl Desktop 3.1 many\nimprovements to the inventory management aspect of the marketplace. Sellers now\nhave access to more options when importing their inventory from CSV files and\ncan easily adjust their product prices in bulk to account for any PART price\nchanges. A notable variety of other improvements related to the management and\npublishing of listings has also been added. \n\nAdjustable escrow deposit ratios A major item we’ve completed with Particl\nDesktop 3.1 is the addition of a customizable security deposit ratio for\nmarketplace escrows. Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock\n100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security\ndeposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with\nParticl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios\nbetween 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from\nmarketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and\nuse-cases. \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two major additions mentioned\nabove, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added\nto Particl Marketplace. Because there is way too much to mention here, we invite\nyou to check out the full list of changes available here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements Various additions, improvements, and bug\nfixes have been made to Particl Desktop. These are changes that are not\nexclusive to the marketplace app itself. Just like with the general marketplace\nimprovements, the list of changes is too big to put here; we invite you to check\nout the full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nThe Funding Request in Details\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests supporting the Particl team and funding its\noperations by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for 6 months\n. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will\nthen publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes\nother than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be\nallocated.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap\n   (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile\n   platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the\n   development team.\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this\n   funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words,\n   not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds\n   being available for later on.\n * Management, legal, and administration (10%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (10%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing\n   (and promotion) budgets.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the\nteam. \n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide\nfunding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related\nactivities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the\nteam may rearrange it as needed.\nVision and Development Priorities\nAfter spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a\nlot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind\nyou, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year,\nthere’ll be much more to show for it.\n\nIn fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s\nthe time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger\ndifference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much\neasier than it was before.\n\nDevelopment Priorities\nWith this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6\nmonths. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we\nconstantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be\nadded to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an\never-evolving situation.\n\nFor more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by\nfollowing this link [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/].\n\nNew Roadmap Revealed (2021)Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn\nabout the next critical steps forward.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/] General\nBasicSwap DEX BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022.\nWith its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and\npublicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to\nannounce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that\nregard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other\nlevel, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s\ngeneral adoption and exposure within the space. \n\nWeb framework The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl\napplications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser\nwithout the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to\ndownload any application. This item will be delivered in increments and we\nexpect that we'll deliver some of the first components of this system during\nthis development cycle. It is a major part of making Particl more accessible to\nthe world and easing its adoption. \n\nKeeping Particl Core up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin code As you probably\nalready know, the Particl coin is a next-generation privacy coin. It uses RingCT\nand CT, much like Monero, but uniquely uses the Bitcoin codebase. As is usual,\nwe pledge to keep its code up-to-date with all the Bitcoin updates, which is\ncritical both in terms of security and usability. \n\nParticl Electrum This new Particl light wallet, based on the very popular\nBitcoin Electrum wallet, provides a lot of “light” functionalities that can be\nleveraged for the many projects we have in mind, notably putting together a new,\nbetter mobile wallet for example. Although that mobile wallet might not see the\nday during the first half of 2022, we expect that, at least, Particl Electrum\nwill. \n\nSMSG 2.0 To ensure that Particl can sustain a much larger number of users, and\nto improve the reliability and performance of applications such as Particl\nMarketplace and the BasicSwap DEX, an update to Particl’s SMSG network is\nplanned for 2022. While we don’t fully expect it to be ready by the end of this\n6-month development period, we are confident that we’ll be making valuable\nprogress towards it. \n\nMarketplace\nBuy flow messaging This Particl Marketplace feature will let buyers and sellers\ncommunicate directly from within Particl Desktop. This is a widely-requested\nfeature that will massively improve the user experience of the marketplace and\nimprove its potential for adoption. This is a preliminary version of a more\ncomplete “chat application” that will eventually serve as a distributed and\nprivate alternative to messaging applications such as a Signal, Telegram,\nElement, etc. \n\nMobile and web gateway (buyers) As we incrementally build components of the web\nframework, they make available some low-hanging fruits. This is the case, for\nexample, of both a web and mobile gateway for buyers. They would make it\npossible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and\npurchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain\nand SMSG network. The early versions of these gateways are expected to be\nrelatively basic but will serve as a good showcase of what the web framework\nwill ultimately allow. \n\nDesktop\nSMSG controller integration The SMSG controller is more of a back-end\ndeliverable that improves how Particl applications interact with the SMSG\nnetwork. While this item may not lead to apparent changes to the end-user, it\nmakes Particl applications more efficient and lets them support more complex\nfeatures. This is a requirement for more advanced SMSG functionalities such as\napplication extensions and desktop plugins (formerly known as “SMSG bots”). \n\nApp extensions and plugins App extensions and Particl Desktop plugins are\nadd-ons that enhance the user experience. Often, they are third-party services\nthat provide valuable functionality such as allowing you to swap\ncryptocurrencies from the desktop app, get price data through oracles, and so\non. While Particl itself is entirely decentralized, these opt-in modules provide\nuseful features that might require third-parties to get involved. By being\nopt-in rather than opt-out, we ensure that only those looking to use those extra\nservices have to deal with the added level of centralization they require. \n\nHardware wallet integration Another widely-requested feature from some of our\nmost security-conscious community members, building hardware integration into\nParticl Desktop will let you connect your favorite hardware wallet (i.e.,\nTrezor, Ledger Nano) and manage the funds it contains without having to use a\nseparate Particl wallet (Particl-Qt). This will let you use Particl Desktop, and\nits applications, without having to make security compromises. \n\nMarketing\nAs for marketing, our plans remain in line with what we’ve recently announced a\nfew weeks ago in our marketing blog post\n[https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/]. Indeed, we intend to\nkeep on gradually ramping up various marketing and outreach efforts as our line\nof products expands and as the barriers to adoption are taken down by the\nrelease of new key features.\n\nHowever, we are planning for a bigger marketing push related to the full release\nof BasicSwap. As we’ve mentioned in the past, we are highly confident in the\nimpact this upcoming DEX will have on the project, not only because of its\nobvious usefulness for the project but also because of the added exposure it\nwill bring to the ecosystem.\n\nDon’t forget, trading is still the number one use-case for cryptocurrencies and\nit’s becoming harder to trade by the day as most exchanges are becoming\nincreasingly restrictive; the release of BasicSwap comes at a very opportune\ntime and will fix a lot of the issues traders face nowadays.\n\nHow to Vote\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this Particl Wiki tutorial\n   [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.

We will be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are likely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at once.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock 100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security deposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from marketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and use-cases.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck3\">A ton of general improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Aside from the two major additions mentioned above, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added to Particl Marketplace.

Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an ever-evolving situation.</p><p>For more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by following <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\">this link</a></strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">New Roadmap Revealed (2021)</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn about the next critical steps forward.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/62859ff1f762453131dee5a6d2c3d04b/medium-roadmap-particl-2021.jpg\"></div></a></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>General</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022. With its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and publicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%.

Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, <strong>the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\"><strong>Funding Distribution Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it.

We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet.

We can obviously point the finger at climate changes, but data centers,\n   especially in the western half of the United States, have a big portion of\n   the blame to take as well.\n * 30% of all data centers in the world are located in the USA, many in the\n   western half of it.\n * Tax breaks may help build data centers\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/arizona-passes-data-center-tax-breaks/] \n   but just who takes the responsibility to monitor the depletion of rivers,\n   lakes, and groundwater reservoirs these data centers cause?\n * In the U.S., the daily water consumption by data centers that report such\n   figures exceeds 1.7 billion liters of water.\n * This number is expected to only be 1/3rd of their actual consumption as it\n   only monitors the water consumption of their cooling systems.\n * Amazon, for example, does not bother measuring or reporting the water usage\n   of their data centers, a worrying fact considering Amazon’s AWS service is\n   powered by one of the biggest data center networks in the country\n   [https://www.wpoven.com/blog/aws-market-share/].

Water cooling is\n   cheaper than air cooling and it uses less energy, sure, but it creates water\n   shortages which tend to often be kept out of the public environmental debate.\n * Arizona for example, which is one of the hottest and driest states in the\n   U.S., is trying to become a new Silicon Valley.

To make things worse, the Colorado River has lost 18% of its flow!

They have a\n   mandatory water restriction in place once this number hits 35%, but they\n   welcome with open arms the insane water requests from tech giants.\n * At least, some tech giants like Microsoft report the water consumption on\n   their cooling systems (but not their total water consumption). That’s unlike\n   Amazon, Google, and Facebook who don’t bother to release any numbers to the\n   public [https://time.com/5814276/google-data-centers-water/].\n * In fact, most of them have 'non-disclosure agreements' NDAs with water\n   companies and local governments\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/after-aquifer-concerns-googles-600m-south-carolina-expansion-finds-new-water-supply/]\n   , to make sure their actual water usage stays a secret. Oh, the hypocrisy!\n\nThat’s a lot to take in, right? By now you probably get the point, but the\nreality is that we’ll need more and more data centers as the worldkeeps on\nincreasing its online presence.

Let’s not be hypocrites here; yes, tech giants act in a very\ndeceiving way and try to sweep the problem under the rug for their own benefit\nand image, but we, the end-user, are ultimately the ones that feed them with the\ndata. As long as we keep using data-hungry services, we are directly causing\nthese environmental issues. The more we use their platforms, the more their data\ncenters will need to grow and the more water will be consumed.\n\nAnd as our online presence is much more likely increase rather than decrease\nover the coming years, there’s a critical question that bears asking.\n\nWhat can I actually do to fix this problem?\nLet's focus on what's under our control. We can’t change the way big tech and\nother internet companies behave; they are and always have been big for-profit\ncorporations with questionable levels of ethics.

The answer may not be as hopeless as\nmight think. \n\nThe internet is currently experiencing what is perhaps its biggest revolution\nsince it began—the rise of \"Web 3\".\n\nWeb 3 is a general term used to reference a new type of applications and web\nservices that work without any third-party or middleman. They are often powered\nby blockchains or other peer-to-peer networks and manage data in a distributed\nway—data is hosted on the computers, or nodes, of the users rather than on\ncentral databases that literally suck the waters out of precious reserves.\n\nTake Particl Marketplace\n[/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/particl.io/marketplace], for example. It’s a\ndistributed online marketplace similar to eBay, but on which no data is\ngenerated. It provides all the essential tools you would need to buy and sell\nstuff online, but unlike eBay, Amazon, or Alibaba, it doesn’t require massive\ndata centers that evaporate our precious water reserves. In fact, it generates\nzero data and has a neutral water consumption level.\n\nOr take Skiff [https://skiff.org/] as another great example. It’s an end-to-end\nencrypted collaborative workspace that gives you similar abilities that you’d\nget using Google Docs, but it does so in a much more ethical way. First, it’s\nprivate and encrypted by default, meaning the company behind cannot collect any\nmeaningful data about you (meaning they then need to store much less of it). And\nsecondly, they are in the process of making their application completely\ndistributed, meaning they could then drastically reduce their \"water consumption\nfootprint\".

These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information about what items\nare planned to be included in the next update in a follow-up blog post that will\nbe published to Particl News very shortly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These are generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.</li></ul><blockquote>Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so backing up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile are backed up as well.</blockquote><ul><li>Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.</li><li>Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the sender's machine.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search criteria under certain cases.</li><li>When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop receiving smsg for that market.</li><li>Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees slightly.</li><li>A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the sending of smsg.</li><li>The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it contains.</li><li>Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market service was starting up.</li><li>Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater visibility when a value is missing.</li><li>The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.</li><li>The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.</li><li>In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed) is shown alongside the refresh button.</li><li>Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).</li></ul><blockquote>Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes afterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to occur.</blockquote><ul><li>Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of items in the batch publish modal.</li><li>Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:</li></ul><blockquote>This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor) as well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for further details).<br><br>These values can be viewed in the listings detail window.<br><br>Do note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's details as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when non-standard escrow ratios are used.<br><br>Orders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any additional information that may be needed.</blockquote><ul><li>A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.</li><li>Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.</li></ul><h3 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h3><ul><li>Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.</li><li>Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored.

publicly available on\ntestnet! You can now download and install the new desktop client and thoroughly\ntest all the new additions and improvements.\n\nThis testnet round introduces a ton of new features, notably an adjustable\nescrow ratio (sellers can decide how much they require buyers to put into\nescrow) and better inventory management for sellers. It also includes a wide\nvariety of bug fixes, general improvements, and quality-of-life tweaks. Check\nout the full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases].\n\n> Note: Important in this update is the addition of two new buttons in the Orders\nsection. One lets you resend your last action (i.e., mark the item as shipped)\nin case it hasn't properly been received by the other party. The other makes\nyour client rescan previous actions by the other party, in case that it is your\nclient that failed to receive it. If you have marketplace transactions that are\nseemingly stuck, these buttons will fix the problem. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.1.0-RC-test001: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0-RC-test001\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.1.0 Public Testnet (release 1) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopTestnet release version for the upcoming release of\nv3.1.0NB!! The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release\nsource code. Please contact Particl for source code information. The ...GitHub\nparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0-RC-test001]To\nget testnet coins, visit the Particl faucet [https://faucet.particl.xyz/].\n\nIf you happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode\n   \"165.22.203.185:51938\" \"add\".\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * The Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\n   application can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n * The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source code.\n   Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\n   source code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval\n   of time has passed.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Fixes various typos, incorrect button labels, and incorrect text/label\n   related concerns.\n * Update to using core v0.21.\n\n> Note that for new users, a default wallet is not automatically created, and so\nthe initial wallet generation (when using the wallet module as the first entry\npoint) will allow for a wallet name to be provided.\n> The particl-core setting txindex will be explicitly enabled by automatically\nupdating the particl.conf file.\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Allow for backing up the market profile mnemonic and passphrase. These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0.

We’ll provide more information on the 3.2\ndeliverables as 3.1 goes live on mainnet.\n\nThanks for your time and help properly testing Particl Desktop 3.1; it ensures\neverything works as expected and speeds the mainnet deployment process. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It improves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by introducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace vendors.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone” release, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial 3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a new dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information on the 3.2 deliverables as 3.1 goes live on mainnet.</p><p>Thanks for your time and help properly testing Particl Desktop 3.1; it ensures everything works as expected and speeds the mainnet deployment process. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

This blog\npost will let you know everything you need about the hardfork and about how to\nprepare ahead. Let’s jump in directly and look at the details more closely.\n\n> Note: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.18\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18] or greater if\nyou haven’t already done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will\nlead you to connect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other\npeople will not be relayed and you won't be earning staking rewards.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardfork Schedule\nIn the first place, Particl’s testnet will hardfork on the 1st of January 2022,\nat 17:00 UTC. This will provide the ability for everybody to ensure that\neverything goes as expected. \n\nThen, on the 1st of February 2022, at 17:00 UTC, Particl's mainnet network will\nhardfork.\n\nPrepare Ahead\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and ensure future functionality of\nyour Particl apps, you need to update your Particl Core node to the latest\nversion available [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]. \n\nOnce you've updated your node(s), you don't need to do anything; you'll\nautomatically fork to the right chain, along with the rest of the network, on\nthe 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC.\n\nThe update procedure differs depending on your environment.\n\nParticl Desktop\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, close it down completely and re-open it. The\nclient will update itself automatically. Look at the bottom left corner of your\nclient; the \"core\" version should display 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Partyman\nIf you are cold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, enter\nthis command to update your node.\n\ncd ~/partyman && ./partyman update\n\nVerify that the update went on as expected by executing this command.\n\n./partyman status\n\nThe displayed version should be version 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Core - QT Wallet\nWith a standalone Particl Core - QT wallet, you need to download and install the\nlatest version manually.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.18 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019218Hashes121365dec50e99eba4c25a2d7ff2a1e968949717bd0d8d6706c3f172fd596373\nparticl-0.19.2.18-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]Particl Copay\nIf you use the mobile Particl Copay wallet, then no user interaction is required\nfrom you. The core version will be updated automatically in time for the\nhardfork.\n\nPART Coins on Cold Staking Pools\nIf you stake coins on cold staking pools, then you don't need to do anything\nother than to ensure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with Particl\n0.19.2.18 or greater. \n\nHowever, you must be aware that if the pool you're staking on doesn't update\ntheir nodes in time for the hardfork, you'll be staking on the wrong chain and\nthus, won't be receiving rewards. For this reason, make sure the cold staking\npool you're staking on updates in time. You can usually do this by appending \n/version or /api/version at the end of the pool's URL (i.e., \nhttps://coldstakingpool.com/api/version). \n\nIf you are the operator of a pool, please follow these instructions\n[https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.md] to\nupdate your node.\n\nPART Coins on Exchanges\nWe have started reaching out to exchanges on which PART is available in\npreparation for this hardfork.\n\nAs is usual, no customer interaction is needed as exchanges manage their own\nnodes. However, make sure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with the latest\nversion of Particl Core.\n\nWhat’s New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings more privacy and smaller transaction fees to Particl\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], \nBasicSwap [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) and for a\nwide variety of transaction types.\n\nparticl-core/fork-notes.md at master · particl/particl-coreParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/master/doc/fork-notes.md#rct-bug-fix-fork-3]\nTaproot\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction.\n\nFixing listing fee adjustment feature\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower. \n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability has been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, once the fee target amount drops below\na certain point, the code won't allow it to change anymore (up or down). This\nhardfork fixes that issue by clamping the minimum amount it can change to 1 sat,\nmaking the feature functional and allowing stakers to adjust listing fees again.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThis hardfork will also re-enable a small number of disabled outputs from people\nwho’ve missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and\nhaven’t put up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the\nsteps mentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\nFailure to submit your claim before the hardfork will mean you’ll have to wait\nfor the next one. If you don’t have any disabled outputs, or simply don’t know\nwhat this is about, then you don’t need to do anything here.\n\n> Note: The deadline to submit your claim for this hardfork is on the 1st of\nJanuary 2022, at 17:00 UTC.\nReducing money supply when outputs are burned (for future use)\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis hardfork is an important one for the ecosystem, notably with the major\naddition of Taproot and the fix to the listing fee adjustment mechanism. \n\nWe recommend that you update your node(s) as soon as possible; failure to do so\nin time for the hardfork will result in you being on the wrong chain.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

For this reason, make sure the cold staking pool you're staking on updates in time. You can usually do this by appending <code class=\"language-text\">/version</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">/api/version</code> at the end of the pool's URL (i.e., <code class=\"language-text\">https://coldstakingpool.com/api/version</code>). </p><p>If you are the operator of a pool, please follow <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.md\"><strong>these instructions</strong></a> to update your node.</p><h3 id=\"part-coins-on-exchanges\">PART Coins on Exchanges</h3><p>We have started reaching out to exchanges on which PART is available in preparation for this hardfork.</p><p>As is usual, no customer interaction is needed as exchanges manage their own nodes.

This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following <a href=\"https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this link</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"increase-the-maximum-size-of-data-outputs\">Increase the maximum size of data outputs</h3><p>This improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more data-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction.</p><h3 id=\"fixing-listing-fee-adjustment-feature\">Fixing listing fee adjustment feature</h3><p>On Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on applications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can broadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl Marketplace to be either higher or lower. </p><p>However, the feature that allows for this ability has been broken ever since reaching a certain target value. In fact, once the fee target amount drops below a certain point, the code won't allow it to change anymore (up or down). This hardfork fixes that issue by clamping the minimum amount it can change to 1 sat, making the feature functional and allowing stakers to adjust listing fees again.</p><h3 id=\"re-enabling-disabled-outputs\">Re-enabling disabled outputs</h3><p>This hardfork will also re-enable a small number of disabled outputs from people who’ve missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and haven’t put up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the steps mentioned <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/\">here</a></strong>. Failure to submit your claim before the hardfork will mean you’ll have to wait for the next one. If you don’t have any disabled outputs, or simply don’t know what this is about, then you don’t need to do anything here.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: The deadline to submit your claim for this hardfork is on the 1st of January 2022, at 17:00 UTC</strong>.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"reducing-money-supply-when-outputs-are-burned-for-future-use-\">Reducing money supply when outputs are burned (for future use)</h3><p>This new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This effectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get burned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value that still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic staking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.</p><hr><p>This hardfork is an important one for the ecosystem, notably with the major addition of Taproot and the fix to the listing fee adjustment mechanism. </p><p>We recommend that you update your node(s) as soon as possible; failure to do so in time for the hardfork will result in you being on the wrong chain.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Amazon – Sell there at your own risk decentralize.todayHere at\ndecentralize.today, we return for the new year and continue with ourweekly\nseries, EXPOSED!, where we reveal the most blatant examples of\ncorporatemalfeasance and governmental corruption. Today we return for a further\nlook at aprevious transgressor, online retailing giant Amazon...the wor…\nDecentralize.TodayPrivacy Advocate\n[https://dt.gl/exposed-amazon-sell-there-at-your-own-risk/]> \"Amazon doesn't even\nbother with design changes, just sticks their smiley arrow logo on it, sells it\nfor half the price, and kills off the competition.\"\nIndeed, Amazon is known for its anti-competition practices. While they\naggressively charge you for every sale you make, they also get to see all of\nyour sales data; valuable information to have if you want to launch products.\nEven better if you plan on launching copycats! In more than one way, just by\nselling on their platform, they get you to pay them…to do their market research.\nInsulting, isn’t it?\n\nSee, the problematic issue here is that Amazon doesn't expose itself to any risk\nwhen launching a new product, nor do they go through the time and effort of\nresearching consumer needs and likes; that’s your burden to carry if you want to\nsucceed, and their success to steal if you do! Instead, Amazon simply accesses\n'your' sales data that you generate when using their platform and use some AI to\ninstantly know what products are selling best or will sell best in the future.\nThen, all that’s left for them to do is to hand the identified product (aka your\nproduct) over to a third-party manufacturer who will create a copycat out of it,\nwith a few minor modifications so that they can avoid almost any patent. The end\nresult? An AmazonBasics product (or one that is sold under any of their\nsub-brands\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-owns-these-brands-list-2018-7]) that’s\nmuch cheaper than the original, both in price…and quality.\n\nIt’s a cynically cost-effective strategy for an organization that has a\nnear-infinite budget and customer reach. And it’s much more so when they control\nwhat is likely to be the world’s most popular online marketplace. \n\nThey copied you, but you’re still making more sales than they’d like? No\nproblem, they’ll just move you to page 10! And while that may sound like a\nshort-term win for consumers because it gets them cheaper products, it is really\na net loss for all when nobody wants to innovate and come up with new products\nanymore out of fear of being screwed over.\n\nThink of it. Imagine being the inventor of a copied product, who invested the\nintellectual and financial capital into its development, put in blood, sweat,\nand tears to get it to production, only to be screwed over right at the moment\nthat he starts getting a tiny bit of success with his product. And Amazon, who\nwere making a handsome (exorbitant) commission selling the original product in\nthe first place, go on to brazenly become your direct competitor using an\nobvious copycat. Of course, to make things even worse, Amazon gets to sell their\nproduct without paying the exorbitant sales fees any other vendor would be\nforced to pay. And so, the consumer loses, the small and local businesses as\nwell, the product inventors too, but Amazon gets to rake in billions of dollars.\nSounds fair and ethical…not!\n\nPrivacy in eCommerce — Protect Your BusinessHow Privacy Can Help You Keep Your\nBusiness AliveParticl Newsdros\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/]\nOpportunistic Behaviour, aka 'Screwing Partners Over'\nLet's look at things from a different perspective.\n\nImagine you start a company that produces something that is 'better than sliced\nbread'. You’ve made it; your business has become successful, and Amazon's\nventure capital arm reaches out to you. Sounds exciting, right? Well, slow down\na little and let's take a look at a couple of examples that might make you\nreconsider whether you would even want to talk to them.\n\nA while ago, Amazon’s fund invested in Defined Crowd [https://www.defined.ai/].\nAs part of that investment, Amazon got access to the finances as well as the\ntechnology of Defined Crowd. Four years later, Daniela Braga, the founder and\nCEO of the company, accused Amazon of stealing their concept\n[https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2020/report-companies-say-amazon-accessed-proprietary-info-to-make-its-own-products/] \nand launching it as A21, a service of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is in\ndirect competition with them. Dealing with Amazon can turn a supposedly helpful\ncapital boost into your worst nightmare.\n\nUbi, who build smart speakers, met Amazon to discuss funding for their product\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-ubi-smart-speaker-2020-7]. Amazon\nwent through their entire pitch, the tech behind it, and shortly afterwards,\nlaunched Echo. Yes, the same Echo that powers Alexa. It was a concept imagined\nby someone who had a billion-dollar idea, but it more than likely ended up being\nstolen and developed by a company too big to drag through court.\n\nIndeed, Amazon has so many more reports of unethical behaviours and unfair,\nanti-competitive practices. Want to hear more about it? Just take this example\nfrom India where Amazon was caught red-handing manipulating search results to\nbenefit their own products and competing ones (and in many cases, original\nproducts that Amazon simply copied, as we mentioned above).\n\nAmazon copied products and rigged search results, documents showA trove of\nAmazon documents reveals how the company ran a campaign in India of creating\nknockoff goods and manipulating search results to boost its own\nproducts.Reuters\nADITYA KALRA in New Delhi and STEVE STECKLOW in London\n[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/]In\nthe end, in all of those cases, someone or a business got AMAZONED!\n\nThankfully, Amazon is gradually being made more accountable and is having to \nanswer to the US House Judiciary Committee\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/house-committee-threatens-amazon-with-criminal-investigation-into-market-dominance] \nfor its immoral and unethical behaviours, but who knows what positive changes\nthat will bring, if any. But really, there is a way for you to protect yourself\nfrom this toxic relationship. Imagine this...\n\nImagine taking Amazon out of your life. Even better, imagine taking any\ncorporate-powered online marketplace like eBay, Alibaba, Etsy, or even payment\nprocessors like Paypal out of your life. Because after all, they all operate\nmore or less the same predatory way.\n\nImagine getting a 5% to 60% (!!!) discount on products and services you buy. You\nknow…what these corporations would typically charge you.\n\nImagine buying unique, more affordable, and more varied products that don’t\nusually end up on their platform. Maybe they come from countries that have no\naccess to them, or maybe they simply don’t want these products around.\n\nImagine if you could directly support local businesses, not corporations, by\ntrading directly with them without anybody in between.\n\nImagine buying or selling stuff online without sharing all your personal\ninformation and data to greedy corporations eager to abuse it for a cheap buck.\nGoodbye leaked credit cards and identify thefts.\n\nImagine buying \"intimate gifts\" for your girlfriend without your wife knowing\nabout it or, huh, well, you know, buying anything without leaving a trace behind\nfor whatever reason applies to you ? #PrivacyMatters\n\nImagine no More!\nStop imagining and start doing what’s best for you now because all of this is\nnow possible thanks to decentralized eCommerce (“DeCommerce”). \n\nDeCommerce has been steadily on the rise in recent years, letting anybody safely\nbuy or sell anything online without any restriction and without going through\nany middleman. So imagine trading directly with other people, without paying any\nfee, and without any restriction or shady practices we too often see. The future\nis here!\n\nDeCommerce is indeed the next logical step towards a world that is freer and a\nfairer. Towards a world where our right to privacy still exists. One where equal\nopportunities are available to all with no regards to where you come from or to\nwho you are.\n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. The DeCommerce revolution\nis already well-underway here at Partic [https://particl.io/marketplace]l\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].

While they aggressively charge you for every sale you make, they also get to see all of your sales data; valuable information to have if you want to launch products. Even better if you plan on launching copycats! In more than one way, just by selling on their platform, they get you to pay them…to do their market research.

Instead, Amazon simply accesses 'your' sales data that you generate when using their platform and use some AI to instantly know what products are selling best or will sell best in the future. Then, all that’s left for them to do is to hand the identified product (aka your product) over to a third-party manufacturer who will create a copycat out of it, with a few minor modifications so that they can avoid almost any patent. The end result? An AmazonBasics product (or one that is sold under <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-owns-these-brands-list-2018-7\">any of their sub-brands</a>) that’s much cheaper than the original, both in price…and quality.</p><p>It’s a cynically cost-effective strategy for an organization that has a near-infinite budget and customer reach.

No problem, they’ll just move you to page 10! And while that may sound like a short-term win for consumers because it gets them cheaper products, it is really a net loss for all when nobody wants to innovate and come up with new products anymore out of fear of being screwed over.</p><p>Think of it. Imagine being the inventor of a copied product, who invested the intellectual and financial capital into its development, put in blood, sweat, and tears to get it to production, only to be screwed over right at the moment that he starts getting a tiny bit of success with his product. And Amazon, who were making a handsome (exorbitant) commission selling the original product in the first place, go on to brazenly become your direct competitor using an obvious copycat. Of course, to make things even worse, Amazon gets to sell their product without paying the exorbitant sales fees any other vendor would be forced to pay. And so, the consumer loses, the small and local businesses as well, the product inventors too, but Amazon gets to rake in billions of dollars.

It contains valuable information still\nvalid to this day regarding adjusting the listing fees of Particl Marketplace.\nPlease consult the table of contents to jump to the relevant section or click\nhere.\nOn the 12th of August 2019, the Particl Open Marketplace launched live on\nmainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-is-now-live-on-mainnet-bed75988b690]\n. This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving\nany data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the\neCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open\nMarketplace is still a Beta piece of software.\n\nThat means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for\nmass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means\nthis current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect\ntesting ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be\nimproved.\n\nIndeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the\ncommunity of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different\nperspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more\nquickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click me)\n * Dynamic Listing Fees\n * Why are Listing Fees Needed\n * High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\n * Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic Listing Fees\nOne of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of\nParticl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an\nitem or service up for sale. \n\nLuckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its\ncommunity of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true\nfor Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. \n\nFor this reason, it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees\nof the marketplace. It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk\nyou through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main\nimplications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That\nwill serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much\nyou want to change the listing fees of the network.\n\nWhy are Listing Fees Needed?\nThere are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing\nitems. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is\nthe ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very\nappealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.\n\nFighting Spam\nThe first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because\nthere is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any\nperson with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from\nspamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees\nto introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low\nend, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings,\nthen it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.\n\nThat’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the\nsame reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or\nParticl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized\nnetworks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no\nrecourse.\n\nKeeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date \nAnother lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to\nkeep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore.\nThat’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation\npowers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite\nproblematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for\na certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the\nseller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order.\nPretty annoying, right?\n\nHow listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on\ntwo factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc)\nand the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you\nset your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system\nworks in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a\nfinancial cost to its duration. \n\nTheoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then\nit is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of\nthe listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.\n\nIncentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network\nAnother important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the\nsecurity of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. \n\nIn fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to\nstakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards\nwill keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a\ngreater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the\nnetwork effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to\nspread the word around in an organic manner.\n\nHigh Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\nBefore you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is\nimportant to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some\narguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both\nperspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.\n\nLower fees\n * Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller\n * Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nHigher fees\n * More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the\n   marketplace and higher barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater\n * Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nIt’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller\nstaking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards \nper listing published, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on\nthe marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more\nindividual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.\n\nTutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\nSo you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but\ndon’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact,\nsince Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast\ntheir target listing fee to the network.\n\nA Community-Powered Tug-of-War\nOne staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he\nwants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community\nconsensus.\n\nListing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week\n(10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by\nstakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a\nconstant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the\nsmsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is\nstaked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee\ntargets broadcast by stakers. \n\nThe smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then,\nonce the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current\nsmsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th\nblock.\n\nThis can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war. Each staker broadcasts\nto the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace\n(higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards\nor downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers\nwant fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If\nthe majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget\nwill slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want\ndramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a\nmuch faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to\ntheir side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a\ndigital game of tug-of-war.\n\n> Note (01-12-2021): The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and\nimproved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee\ntarget at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.\nThe fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small\nincrements enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the\nprocess of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and\nunpredictable changes).\n\nPut the current value into perspective\nTo get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the\ncurrent market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into\nperspective.\n\nNote: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3\nimages per item and 1000 chars of text.\n\n# Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43\n\nIn the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100\nlistings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale\nwith Particl Marketplace.\n\nNow, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So,\nideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should\nget increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is\nneeded.\n\nBroadcast a Different Listing Fee Target\nThe way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're\ncurrently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two\nthings:\n\n * Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget\n * Broadcast your desired target to the network\n\nIf You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt\nIf you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet\n“unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is\npretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of\nsmsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. \n\nTo do so, simply open up the <console> and enter the smsggetfeerate command.\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nconsole window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns\nthe value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This\nis important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast\ndepending on your preference.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the\nfollowing command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target\nyou want to set.\n\nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nFor example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you\nwould put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then\nsimply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. \nNote that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.\n\n> Important: If you already have a custom stakingoptions parameter, like a custom \nrewardaddress, for example, then please enter the following command into the\n<console> and replace addr by the rewardaddress you set up previously: \nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nIf You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node\nIf you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need\nto broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. \n\nTo do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that\nyou can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and\nenter the following command:\n\n./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nterminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. \n\nAt the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255.\nThis means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to\nknow as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your\npreference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first\nupdate your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:\n\ncd partyman && git pull\n\n Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:\n\n./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget\n\nThis command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that\nyour node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a\nnew target or not. If you wish to do so, type y to move forward through the\nprocess. \n\nOnce that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your\ndesired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if\nyou would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the\nvalue at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the\nvalue at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve\nchosen and written your new target, press Enter to apply the change and start\nbroadcasting it to the network. Note that your desired value has to be 8\ndecimals or less.\n\nIf You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your\ndesired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking\nnode or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your\nliking.\n\nIf You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different\ntarget, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following \nthis link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md]\n.\n\nIf You’re Not Staking\nIf you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the\nnetwork. This is a golden opportunity for you to get started with staking and be\npart of Particl’s fully decentralized consensus-finding process. If you want to\nget started with cold staking, simply follow the steps available in this\nParticl\nAcademy tutorial\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/guides/guide_mp_general_enable_staking.html]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow you’re all set to start broadcasting your listing fee target rate to the\nnetwork.

This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving any data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the eCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open Marketplace is still a Beta piece of software.</p><p>That means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for mass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means this current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect testing ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be improved.</p><p>Indeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the community of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different perspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more quickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.</p><hr><h2 id=\"table-of-content-click-me-\">Table of Content (Click me)</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</h2><p>One of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of Particl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an item or service up for sale. </p><p>Luckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its community of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true for Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. </p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees of the marketplace.</strong> It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk you through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main implications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That will serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much you want to change the listing fees of the network.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed?</h2><p>There are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing items. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is the ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very appealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>The first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because there is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any person with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from spamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees to introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low end, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings, then it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.</p><p>That’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the same reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or Particl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized networks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no recourse.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-the-marketplace-content-up-to-date\">Keeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date </h3><p>Another lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to keep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore. That’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation powers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite problematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for a certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the seller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order. Pretty annoying, right?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image-4.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image-4.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-4.png 1313w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>How listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on two factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc) and the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you set your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system works in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a financial cost to its duration. </p><p>Theoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then it is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of the listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.</p><h3 id=\"incentivizing-stakers-to-secure-the-network\">Incentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network</h3><p>Another important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the security of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. </p><p>In fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to stakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards will keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a greater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the network effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to spread the word around in an organic manner.</p><h2 id=\"high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</h2><p>Before you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is important to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some arguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both perspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image-7.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image-7.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-7.png 1314w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"lower-fees\">Lower fees</h3><ul><li>Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller</li><li>Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><h3 id=\"higher-fees\">Higher fees</h3><ul><li>More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the marketplace and higher barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater</li><li>Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><p>It’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller staking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards <strong>per listing published</strong>, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on the marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more individual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.</p><h2 id=\"tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</h2><p>So you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but don’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact, since Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast their target listing fee to the network.</p><h3 id=\"a-community-powered-tug-of-war\">A Community-Powered Tug-of-War</h3><p>One staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he wants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community consensus.</p><p>Listing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week (10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by stakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a constant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the smsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is staked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee targets broadcast by stakers. </p><p>The smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then, once the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current smsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th block.</p><p><strong>This can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war</strong>. Each staker broadcasts to the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace (higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards or downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to their side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a digital game of tug-of-war.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note (01-12-2021):</em></strong><em> The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and improved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022.

The same is true for Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. </p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees of the marketplace.</strong> It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk you through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main implications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That will serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much you want to change the listing fees of the network.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed?</h2><p>There are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing items. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is the ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very appealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>The first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because there is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any person with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from spamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees to introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low end, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings, then it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.</p><p>That’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the same reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or Particl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized networks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no recourse.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-the-marketplace-content-up-to-date\">Keeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date </h3><p>Another lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to keep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore. That’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation powers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite problematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for a certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the seller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order. Pretty annoying, right?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image-4.png 1313w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>How listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on two factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc) and the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you set your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system works in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a financial cost to its duration. </p><p>Theoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then it is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of the listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.</p><h3 id=\"incentivizing-stakers-to-secure-the-network\">Incentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network</h3><p>Another important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the security of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. </p><p>In fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to stakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards will keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a greater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the network effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to spread the word around in an organic manner.</p><h2 id=\"high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</h2><p>Before you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is important to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some arguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both perspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image-7.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image-7.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image-7.png 1314w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"lower-fees\">Lower fees</h3><ul><li>Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller</li><li>Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><h3 id=\"higher-fees\">Higher fees</h3><ul><li>More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the marketplace and higher barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater</li><li>Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><p>It’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller staking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards <strong>per listing published</strong>, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on the marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more individual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.</p><h2 id=\"tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</h2><p>So you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but don’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact, since Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast their target listing fee to the network.</p><h3 id=\"a-community-powered-tug-of-war\">A Community-Powered Tug-of-War</h3><p>One staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he wants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community consensus.</p><p>Listing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week (10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by stakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a constant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the smsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is staked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee targets broadcast by stakers. </p><p>The smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then, once the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current smsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th block.</p><p><strong>This can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war</strong>. Each staker broadcasts to the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace (higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards or downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to their side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a digital game of tug-of-war.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note (01-12-2021):</em></strong><em> The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and improved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee target at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.</em></blockquote><p>The fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small increments enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the process of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and unpredictable changes).</p><h4 id=\"put-the-current-value-into-perspective\">Put the current value into perspective</h4><p>To get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the current market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into perspective.</p><p>Note: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3 images per item and 1000 chars of text.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43</code></pre></div><p>In the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100 listings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale with Particl Marketplace.</p><p>Now, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So, ideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should get increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is needed.</p><h2 id=\"broadcast-a-different-listing-fee-target\">Broadcast a Different Listing Fee Target</h2><p>The way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're currently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two things:</p><ul><li>Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget</li><li>Broadcast your desired target to the network</li></ul><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-either-particl-desktop-or-particl-qt\">If You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt</h3><p>If you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet “unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is pretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. </p><p>To do so, simply open up the &#x3C;console> and enter the <code class=\"language-text\">smsggetfeerate</code> command.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image.png 1269w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the console window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns the value <code class=\"language-text\">23255</code>. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the following command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target you want to set.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"smsgfeeratetarget\"</span>:0.00000001<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div><p>For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> If you already have a custom <em>stakingoptions</em> parameter, like a custom <em>rewardaddress</em>, for example, then please enter the following command into the &#x3C;console> and replace <em>addr</em> by the <em>rewardaddress</em> you set up previously: </blockquote><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"rewardaddress\"</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"addr\"</span>,<span class=\"token string\">\"smsgfeeratetarget\"</span>:0.00000001<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"if-you-re-cold-staking-coins-on-a-staking-node\">If You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node</h3><p>If you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need to broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. </p><p>To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and enter the following command:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate</code></pre></div><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the terminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. </p><p>At the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first update your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> partyman <span class=\"token operator\">&#x26;&#x26;</span> <span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull</code></pre></div><p> Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget</code></pre></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Adjusting-Listing-Fees/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that your node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve chosen and written your new target, press <code class=\"language-text\">Enter</code> to apply the change and start broadcasting it to the network. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your desired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking node or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your liking.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-operating-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different target, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md\">this link</a></strong>.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-not-staking\">If You’re Not Staking</h3><p>If you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the network.

expanding its ecosystem with\na brand new distributed application: BasicSwap.\n\nBasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol\nthat allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another without any middleman or\nthird-party being involved. It lets you make or take orders on a distributed\norder book and execute swaps that are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and\nprivate. To find out what makes it a one-of-a-kind DEX, keep on reading this\nblog post!\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeParticl’s\nupcoming DEX is powered by the atomic swap technology\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/a-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/] \nand the SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, making it entirely decentralized and devoid of any central operator. No KYC,\nno trickery, no false promises. Just pure decentralization and privacy. And yes,\nin case you were wondering, it is fully compatible with Monero (XMR) and will be\nright from the get-go! ?\n\nIn this blog post, we will take a deep look into this new Particl distributed\napplication. We’ll detail how it’s going to fit in as a critical component of\nthe Particl ecosystem and, perhaps even more importantly, ensure the personal\nfreedom and financial sovereignty of its users.\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Particl Ecosystem Explained\n * The BasicSwap DEX Explained\n * List of Compatible Coins\n * Key Features\n * Monetization\n * How Does it Compare?\n * Why is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\n * Open Beta Coming Soon\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem Explained\nThe first step to understanding the significance of BasicSwap’s upcoming release\nfor Particl is to get a good grasp of what the Particl ecosystem is.\n\nParticl Marketplace, accessible through Particl DesktopParticl is an ecosystem\nthat gives you the ability to live completely free by cutting off middlemen\nentirely. It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights,\nfreedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy\ndevelopment, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy\nthat people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other\nwords, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.\n\nIn many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of\n“decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key\nservices or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can\nalso see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is\nan ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any\nthird-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly\nimportant step towards that vision.\n\nIn fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially\nindependent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and\nunstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is\nrequired. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through\ncentralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While\ncentralized exchanges (i.e., Bittrex\n[https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART], WizardSwap\n[https://wizardswap.io/]) can provide many benefits and unique features, not\nhaving any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be\nuncompromisingly independent. But that’s all about to change!\n\nNow let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a\ncornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will\nbecome a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that\nend up on it.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX Explained\nKeeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely\nindependent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell\nor trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast,\nand decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to\ndo, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeBasicSwap\nis a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency\nfor another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. \n\nSwaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a\ndistributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is\ndecentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you\ncan check the code yourself!\n\nList of Compatible Coins\n * Bitcoin\n * Monero\n * Particl\n * Litecoin\n * Namecoin\n\nWe are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens,\nshortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled\ncryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing\nblockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may\nbecome available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration\nroadmap.\n\nKey Features\nBasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers\nmany benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing\nfeatures that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.\n\nDistributed Order Books\nBasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of\nswapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or\nPancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book\n(maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been\nplaced on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap\nmore akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading\non, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.\n\nNote that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s\norder book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of\ncentralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by\ndesign, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and\nthat's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s\nown P2P network, SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, which is the same network that powers Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].\n\nThe main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at\nthe exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more\ntraditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to\nsmart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of rug pulls\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/] and\nother theoretical exploits they carry.\n\nBut there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be\ndeployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being\nlooked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as\nsoon (™) as we can!\n\nTrue Cross-Chain Swaps\nParticl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other\nDEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one\nnative coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!\n\nYou can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e.,\nMonero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different\nEthereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require\ncoins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart\nChain, or other similar chains).\n\nThe World’s Most Private Trading Exchange\nTo top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well,\nit means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send\ndocuments, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary\nmaximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and\nwithout any care about who you are or where you live.\n\nThat’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become\nway too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively\nincrease your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins\nlike Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy\nbetween two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). \n\nIndeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you\nswap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (\nConfidentialTransactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation]),\nor anon (RingCT\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other\nprivacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).\n\nBut there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and\ndeploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style\ncurrencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other\nwords, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a\nBitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective\nblockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!\n\nIndeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta.\nThat's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable\nfunctionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!\n\nThe combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the\nworld’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will\nmake you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live\nfree...because, well, now you can!\n\nOther Interesting Features\nThere are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap\nwill become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected\nto grow gradually.\n\n * True Monero support\n * No account, sign up, or KYC\n * Incredibly low and competitive fees\n * User-friendly interface\n * No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point\n * Taproot compatible\n * Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)\n\nWhat About Monetization?\nAs BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from\nswaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we\nabsolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will\ncause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that\nthe DEX was the missing piece all along.\n\nIndeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for\nusing the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the\nentire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the\nDEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or\nused as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely\nto be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy\njust yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.\n\nIn other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as\nmore people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the\nPART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your\nstaking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on\nthe Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).\n\nKeep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little\nfriction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive\nwith industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.\n\nHow Does it Compare\nWe know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and\ndecentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and\noffers something quite unique.\n\nIn the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from\nother trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some\nof the other solutions around.\n\nBittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.  Compared to centralized exchanges... \n\nYou control your keys at any point in time You don't have to create an account\nor submit any document You don't need to verify yourself (KYC) There's no upper\nlimit as to how much you can trade per period of time You remain private every\nstep of the way There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at\nall \n\nUniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.  Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools… \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want Swaps are truly cross-chain; no wrapped token\nrequired (i.e., wBTC) Providing liquidity is done in a more traditional way\nusing order books (as opposed to liquidity pools) There's no rug to pull (read\nmore about the infamous rug pulls here\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/]) \n\nBISQ  Compared to the BISQ exchange... \n\nThe process of swapping is entirely decentralized and done between two people No\nsecurity deposit or escrow intermediary required Fees are lower Swaps are atomic\nby nature, you can’t be scammed or tricked by bad actors \n\nCOMIT  Compared to the COMIT network... \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want You can swap a vast selection of cryptocurrencies;\nit’s not exclusively Monero-centric Uses the SMSG network to safely execute\nswaps All options and steps are available from a user interface \n\nWhy is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\nUtility Impact on Particl\nThe most obvious reason for BasicSwap to be is to provide the Particl ecosystem\nwith an independent, autonomous, and private way to swap, buy, and sell the\nnative currency of the platform (PART) for as many other cryptocurrencies as\npossible.\n\nEarly mockup of a BasicSwap integration into Particl Desktop | Work-in-progress\nthat is subject to changeRelying on centralized exchanges and partners can\nprovide useful solutions and avenues to trade PART, but it makes the entire\necosystem dependent on them which is an unbearable risk. With BasicSwap, Particl\nbecomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of\nthe project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl\npermanently unstoppable!\n\nPromoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty\nAt this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies\nyield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon\nbillions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both\ncentralized and decentralized.\n\nFurthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish\nto impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life,\ncentralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more\nand more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of\ntrading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to\naccentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a\nParticl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting\nthousands if not millions of users, daily.\n\nWith this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows\ndarker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By\ngiving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to\nanother, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows\npeople to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.\n\nAs a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or\nrestrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you\nare, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s\nentirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to\nattract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from\nthis audience.\n\nExposure for the Project\nBecause of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all\ninterconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start\nusing other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to\naccentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop.\nAfter all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains\nas well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you\ndo (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).\n\nFor this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms\nof communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as\na complement to the marketplace.\n\nThat being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for\nParticl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions\nworth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of\nfeatures is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.\n\nIndeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation,\nreleasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a\nmajor bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the\ngood word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community,\nit’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new\nproduct other than the marketplace!\n\nEasier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace\nAll payments on Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] are\nprivate. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to\nuse it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT\nprivacy state (click here to learn more\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications]\n) are located.\n\nAnd because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.)\nwork using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires\nnew users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from\ntheir public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a\nsignificant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a\nsimple solution to that problem.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of\nyour choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for\nexample, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready)\nbalances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART\nusing your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to\nuse the marketplace right away!\n\nIncreasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards\nAs you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit\nthe entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is\nset in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand\nfor PART, reduce its circulating supply (burning coins), and introduce\nincentives for providing liquidity.\n\nOf course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as\npossible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also\nimportant to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to\nuse, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what\nmonetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!\n\nWhen is the Open Beta Going Live?\nCurrently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for\nseveral months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just\nabout to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we\nexpect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year\npresent to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be\nconsidered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.\n\nWhat to Expect From the Open Beta?\nBy any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will\nstill very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough\nexperience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name\nimplies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX\nand to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast\nselection of environments and situations.\n\nHere are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.\n\n * Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins\n * Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More\n   coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full\n   release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the\n   number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a\n   bigger focus.\n * You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions.\n   There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but\n   rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify\n   onboarding as much as possible.\n * A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at\n   least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups\n   that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test\n   the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more\n   advanced types of users.\n * You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap\n   (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on\n   taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.\n * As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t\n   worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy\n   to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we\n   (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap\n   that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that\n   it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather\n   than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!\n\nOf course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend\non revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the\nlifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!\n\nWhat’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?\nAs we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few\nitems that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as\nan insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several\nmonths now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta\nrelease.\n\n * More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and\n   installation process.\n * Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.\n * Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.\n\nOnce these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open\nBeta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will\ngo live.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and\nstrongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and\nsuccess of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major\nplay towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The\nbenefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further\nthan simply being helpful for the Particl community.\n\nAs such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post,\nbut we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the\ninfamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?\n\nSo, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update\neither in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development\nprogress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        </br>\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, /glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible.

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

is live! Built and\ndesigned from the ground up by the team, it’s a massive improvement over the\nprevious website. It better tells Particl’s story and mission and puts the\nspotlight on its products and the many benefits they offer.\n\nThere's no better way to discover the new website and understand its direction\nby visiting it yourself. Follow this link to discover the new front page of the\nParticl project: https://particl.io/\n\nParticl.io - Apps that respect your rightsCut off the middleman and live free\nwith apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy. A world of\nopportunities awaits you!Particl.io - Apps that respect your rights\n[https://particl.io/]Why a New Website?\nParticl is a mission-driven project with strong convictions. It is supported by\nincredibly talented developers who’ve built a unique and innovative\ndecentralized platform that finally shifts the balance of power back into the\nhands of the people, not greedy corporations. The implications of that are huge\nand it has the potential to change a lot of aspects of our lives.\n\nBut somehow, the now-previous website didn’t fully do full justice to the\nproject's mission and intentions. Although it detailed the project’s unique\ntechnical points (and they sure are impressive), it was easy for new, curious\npeople to miss the bigger picture that ties everything together. That made it\nmore challenging to turn these interested people into new users and fans of the\nproject and limited the impact of any marketing, PR, or outreach effort.\n\nThat's why Particl needed a new website, especially now with the release of\nParticl V3 which pushes the project into a new phase where outreach will be more\nprevalent.\n\nThe Objectives Behind it\nThe website has been built with two simple but clear objectives in mind.\n\n- Showcase Particl’s products and their benefits\n\n- Tell Particl’s story and its mission.\n\nBuilding the website according to these two objectives ensures that the big\npicture becomes apparent and that people understand the purpose of the project,\nwhat it's working to achieve, and what they can get from it.\n\nAfter all, the official website is where new people land when they want to learn\nmore about a project. It’s what they use to make their first impression and\ndecide whether they want to dig deeper or skip the project out of a lack of\ninterest. And with so many projects to look at nowadays and the sheer number of\ndistractions screaming for attention, you have to transmit your message as\nclearly and concisely as possible if you want people to stick around and be\ninterested in digging deeper.\n\nA Website in Expansion\nParticl’s new website is expected to continue expanding and evolving as we move\nforward in time, especially as the upcoming Particl DEX (BasicSwap) soon enters\nits open beta phase. You can track its progress by following the Particl.io\nrepository [https://github.com/particl/particl.io] on Github.\n\nThe Cornerstone of All Upcoming Marketing Efforts\nThe website is where most marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns redirect people\nto. It has to be able to convert curious or interested people into new users of\nfans of the project. After all, that's where these people will be forming their\nfirst impression on the project.\n\nFor this reason, it’s easy to understand why the website is the cornerstone of\nmarketing. It is the key to capitalizing on successful initiatives and turning\npotentially interested people into real users and supporters.\n\nTo that effect, we've published, last week, the team's vision and short to\nmid-term plans for marketing here on Particl News. To learn about the marketing\ninitiatives soon to be deployed, simply follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/\n\nMarketing Particl to the WorldGet familiar with Particl’s short to mid term\nmarketing and adoption plan.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoth the new Particl.io website and the recent launch of the Particl Academy\nmake it easier than ever to introduce new people to Particl and turn them into\nusers and supporters. And with marketing gradually ramping up, Particl is about\nto start turning heads.\n\nAnd you can help accelerate things too! If you know people, communities, people,\nor anyone else you think would like Particl’s mission and products, don’t\nhesitate to send them over to Particl.io and the Particl Academy. “Teamwork\nmakes the dream work”, they say, and we certainly believe in that!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

going full steam ahead.\nShortly after raising funds from the decentralized treasury fund\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-1.html], the Particl team\nhas set up a few initiatives in motion and been cranking up development!\n\nIn terms of significant milestones since, we find the long-anticipated Particl\nV3 mainnet release [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/], \nParticl Core catching up to the latest Bitcoin version (0.22)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.1.0rc1], the\nupcoming BasicSwap DEX nearing its open beta phase, and the reveal of a\nwork-in-progress wallet: Electrum (with support for a Lightning Network user\ninterface).\n\nWhile all of these achievements are exciting from a technical standpoint, many\nin the community have been wondering: “But what about marketing?”. This blog\npost will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and\nstrategy as we progress onward.\n\nTable of Contents\n * Putting Marketing in Context\n * Upcoming Marketing Initiatives\n * BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener\n * Community Empowerment\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPutting Marketing in Context\nFirst thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid\nany confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness,\nPR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to\ngain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging\ntowards making Particl more known, liked, and used.\n\nWhy do Marketing?\nIn the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.\n\n * Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)\n * Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.\n\nFor marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need\nto be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any\nmarketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the\necosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to\nstick around and be clear.\n\nThis strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project\nonly spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a\n“spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an\nextreme cost.\n\nHow to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?\nTo achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches\nto marketing.\n\nProduct-focused marketing: Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what\nproducts the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences.\nThis aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked\nto adoption efforts.\n\nBrand awareness and notoriety building: The other approach is to increase\nParticl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part\nof “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve\nnever really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the\nmore free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. \n\nThese two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns\n(mentioned a bit further down this post).\n\nHow is Marketing Funded at Particl?\nParticl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of\ncrowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates\nout of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic\ntreasury system.\n\nThis means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very\nlarge-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the\n“pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets\nusually leverage.\n\nAdditionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current\nlow liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very\ncareful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant\ndownward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.\n\nMarketing Expectations\nDue to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within\nthe blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan\naround that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.\n\nThat’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and\nstrategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many\ninitiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of\nbeing widespread.\n\nAdditionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product.\nIndeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can\nstill be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically\napt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl\nevolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means\nthat marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the\nproduct might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the\nright audiences to target is key.\n\nUpcoming Marketing Initiatives\nNow that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a\ndeeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in\nprogress.\n\nWhat we've done recently\nRe-initiating direct mail marketing Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications. This aims to\nre-engage people who’ve shown interest in Particl in the past and stay connected\nwith current fans. Direct mail marketing is a basic but powerful marketing tool\nand will be used sporadically (we won’t spam your inbox) for essential and\nbundled communications pieces. \n\nIf you still haven’t subscribed to our newsletter, don’t hesitate to do so; it’s\nthe best way to stay in touch! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Particl Academy The Particl Academy is the\nuser-friendly guide to get started with Particl and become more familiar with\nit. It’s a critical piece of information required for newcomers to be able to\nstart using the platform without any hassle. \n\nThis can be the difference between someone interested but who gives up because\nit’s too difficult to get started and someone who sticks around. To browse the\nParticl Academy, simply head over to https://academy.particl.io/ \n\nProduct marketing New roadmap The new development roadmap is not necessarily a\nmarketing item in the proper sense, but it’s nonetheless a vital part of the\nmarketing strategy. That’s because that is where new people usually look to see\nwhat’s coming up next for a project and what is its long-term viability. \n\nThe new roadmap was carefully crafted to make user adoption easier by improving\nthe platform’s accessibility, usability, and user-friendliness. In addition, it\ncommunicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and\nhelps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul. \n\nProduct marketing What's currently in progress\nNew website Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone\nof any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land\nwhen they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a\nmarketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting\nfor its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its\nbest and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better\nconversion rates! \n\nOn that note, we are excited to announce that the new website will go live this\ncoming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021. So make sure to be around next week\nfor its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to\nshow it to everybody! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit) Digital ads are\nhelpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing\nobjectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n\nSecondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us\nto test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can\nthen use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on\nwhat really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we\nare already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few\nother initiatives. \n\nPreparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will\ngradually ramp up within the next three months. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More stories on Particl News At this time,\nParticl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting\nfor those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into\nadvocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain\nParticl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the\nbigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally,\nSEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website. \n\nThis initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few\nwriters. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own\ndedicated “Stories” section. Make sure to have a read when you see a new story\ncome out and share it with the people you think will be interested in it! \n\nBrand awareness Reboot of the Part-Time Show You might remember the Part-Time\nShow, the podcast by Particl ambassador Dr. Kapil. As part of the Particl\nreboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time,\ndifferently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show\nwill feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert. \n\nIt will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including\ne-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed\nnetworks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a\nParticl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much\nmore dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful\ndiscussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s\nsociety. \n\nClubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.\nWe hope that you join along the weekly episodes and participate in the\ndiscussion with us. You might just meet some fascinating folks! More information\nis to come about this in the next few days as we near the first episode. \n\nBrand awareness New team member To help with the many marketing tasks we have on\nour deck, a new team member will join the communications and marketing team in\nNovember. This new team member, which will mostly fill the role of a\ncommunications assistant, will be critical in allowing the team to deploy\nmultiple initiatives in parallel and amplify our efforts. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Community budget Also to help with marketing\nand encourage community initiatives, the team will be setting up and deploying a\ncommunity marketing budget very soon. At the time of this writing, a group has\nbeen formed on Element with a few community members eager to help spread the\nword and deploy initiatives of their own. A community budget intends on\nsupporting these go-getters with resources from the team. \n\nLookup the Community Empowerment section of this blog post further down below\nfor more information on how to get involved. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Occasional Reddit AMAs With the Particl reboot\ngoing on strong, there are a lot of things changing around the project and a ton\nto look out for. But with so much information, it’s possible that you may have\nsome questions. So from time to time, the Particl team will run AMAs on its\nsub-Reddit and pin it so that anyone can ask their questions and have the answer\ndisplayed prominently for all others to see. This should help with transparency\nand circulating important information to the community. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing What comes after\nWider distribution of press releases Distributing press releases in quality\npublications will lead to more organic coverage as editors and writers scout PR\npublications daily for exciting content. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More podcast appearances and interviews With\nimproving Particl's brand awareness in mind, appearing in more podcasts and\ninterviews will help spread the Particl word further and expose the project to\nmany more people. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Publish more documentation For Particl to gain\nadoption, using the platform and understanding how to use it must be as easy as\npossible. Publishing more educational, informational, and technical\ndocumentation will help with that. \n\nProduct marketing Increase social media activity and exposure Crypto Twitter is\nwhere it's at, and Particl needs to have better exposure within that community\nif it wants to go viral. So improving Particl's social media exposure and taking\npart in the discussion is important and planned for the near future. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Integrate other coins into Particl Desktop \nBecause so much has changed with Particl V3, support for other coins is\ntemporarily disabled. We plan on adding that feature back right after releasing\nthe SMSG Manager (roadmap item). Integrating more coins and making it easier for\ntheir users to acquire PART increases the potential for adoption within these\ncommunities. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing New exchange listings Getting listed on new\nexchanges is a no-brainer to improve liquidity, exposure and make the platform\nmore accessible. The team is currently in negotiation with two exchanges and\nshould have more news on the subject soon. More exchange listings are planned as\nlong as the listing costs are reasonable, and the exchange can provide real\nvalue back to the project. \n\nBrand awareness Seed the marketplace with more listings A few months ago, a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html] that\nsuggested seeding the marketplace with many listings was published (and funded).\nAdding thousands of listings will give the marketplace the boost it needs to get\nthe ball rolling and become a vibrant e-commerce platform. This initiative is\ncurrently under active development. \n\nProduct marketing It obviously doesn't stop here, but the team will work on the\nitems mentioned above in the short to mid-term. If you have any marketing ideas\nor suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.\n\nBasicSwap; A Major Door Opener\nWhen it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl\nMarketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind\ndecentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new\nParticl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open\nbeta: BasicSwap.\n\nAs you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t\nknow each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains.\nBasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the\nsame time, the project’s marketing strategy.\n\nIncidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for\ncryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to\nregister and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look\nfor decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share\nof decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an\nexcellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!\n\nBasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible,\nprivate, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads.\nBasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on\nits own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an\nintegrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl\necosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an\nall-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming\nto fruitition!\n\nIn other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful\napp; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader\nParticl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind\nwhen you talk about Particl to other people.\n\nCommunity Empowerment\nThe best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community.\nThat’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a\nnew dedicated budget!\n\nDo you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead?\nThen simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a\nwritten proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked\nto publish it on the CCS [https://ccs.particl.io]. Once your proposal is live,\nthe team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.\n\nPublishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level\nof transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps\ndetermine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to\nparticipate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!\n\n> Note 1: Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels\nof detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write\nthem down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative\nyourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in\nPART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately\nheaded by whoever makes a proposal.\n> Note 2: If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to\nlead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the\nidea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Hence, selecting the right audiences to target is key.</p><h2 id=\"upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</h2><p>Now that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in progress.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What we've done recently</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Re-initiating direct mail marketing</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

This blog post will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and strategy as we progress onward.</p><h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</h2><p>First thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid any confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness, PR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to gain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging towards making Particl more known, liked, and used.</p><h3 id=\"why-do-marketing\">Why do Marketing?</h3><p>In the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.</p><ul><li>Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)</li><li>Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.</li></ul><p>For marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need to be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any marketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the ecosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to stick around and be clear.</p><p>This strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project only spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a “spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an extreme cost.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-achieve-our-marketing-objectives\">How to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?</h3><p>To achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches to marketing.</p><p><strong>Product-focused marketing: </strong>Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what products the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences. This aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked to adoption efforts.</p><p><strong>Brand awareness and notoriety building: </strong>The other approach is to increase Particl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part of “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve never really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the more free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. </p><p>These two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns (mentioned a bit further down this post).</p><h3 id=\"how-is-marketing-funded-at-particl\">How is Marketing Funded at Particl?</h3><p>Particl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of crowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates out of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic treasury system.</p><p>This means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very large-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the “pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets usually leverage.</p><p>Additionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current low liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very careful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant downward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.</p><h3 id=\"marketing-expectations\">Marketing Expectations</h3><p>Due to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within the blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan around that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.</p><p>That’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and strategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many initiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of being widespread.</p><p>Additionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product. Indeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can still be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically apt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl evolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means that marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the product might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the right audiences to target is key.</p><h2 id=\"upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</h2><p>Now that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in progress.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What we've done recently</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Re-initiating direct mail marketing</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

As such, we are happy to release\nthe new updated development roadmap and major milestones ahead of us.\n\nIn this post, we’ll expand on Particl’s vision for the future and break down\nevery roadmap item. We also have a few words on marketing, PR, adoption, and the\nnew website so make sure to read this blog post in full!\n\nTable of Contents\n * Particl V3\n * Roadmap objectives\n * Discover the new roadmap\n * BasicSwap Open Beta\n * Web framework\n * What about marketing?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 – The Foundation of Particl's entire ecosystem\nThe release of Particl V3 on mainnet represents a major milestone for the\nproject. Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which\nthe future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this\nessential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a\nnecessary step in the evolution of the project.\n\nIndeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use\napps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end\nfunctionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply\nput, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of\nthe roadmap items presented today.\n\nRoadmap Objectives\nThe roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.\n\nImprove Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of\naudiences.\nParticl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application\nthat can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course,\nthis is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking\ntechnology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making\nParticl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.\n\nImprove the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.\nBecause Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features,\nfunctionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot\nof sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore,\nthe Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the\ndevelopment of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to\ngenerate adoption.\n\nImprove Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of\nadoption.\nIn a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption\nof the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be\nready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no\ndowntime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the\ncase, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important\nfactor in the conception of this roadmap.\n\nDiscover the New Roadmap\nDue to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different\ncategories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear\ndocument. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at\na time depending on various factors.\n\nTags\nOn the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag\nrepresents a different status.\n\n * Completed: The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant\n   version of it has been deployed.\n * In progress: The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already\n   started being worked on.\n * Research: The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently\n   under research.\n * Ongoing: The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.\n * Later: The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap\n   items in the list.\n * [NO TAG]: The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment,\n   but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX  What?\nA cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps\nand SMSG.\n\nWhy?\nBasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and\nSMSG. It lets you swap a vast number of coins privately without anyone in\nbetween and without paying trading fees. BasicSwap is compatible with multiple\ncoins like PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and more. \n\nIn progress Closed beta SMSG 2.0  What?\nA new version of SMSG that is significantly more scalable.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption increases and more Particl apps use SMSG as its backbone,\nSMSG 2.0 ensures that the network can scale appropriately. This massive update\nwill make it possible to support all current and upcoming Particl apps without\nany scaling issue. \n\nResearch Lightning Network GUI  What?\nA user-friendly interface for Particl's Lightning Network.\n\nWhy?\nParticl's Lightning Network is already live on mainnet, but there's currently no\neasy way to use it. Particl Electrum provides a user-friendly interface for\neveryone to enjoy all the benefits of the Lightning Network; near-infinite\ntransaction scalability, near-zero fees, near-instant settlements, and more. \n\nIn progress Web framework (marketplace on the web)  What?\nA web framework to bring the Particl ecosystem to the web.\n\nWhy?\nFor Particl to gain maximum adoption, it needs to be accessible and operable\nthrough the web. Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the\nmarketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is\nexpected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser\nmay be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e.,\nsearch engine friendly content) will be added over time. \n\nLater Research Encrypted messaging app  What?\nA decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.\n\nWhy?\nThe SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network. With a proper\ninterface, it can be used as a messaging application that's fast, secure,\nunstoppable, uncensorable, and private. This \"chat\" functionality may come in\ndifferent packages over time (i.e., Particl Desktop app, integration into the\nmarketplace, mobile app, etc.). \n\nLater \"Major milestones\" are the most important deliverables of the new roadmap.\nThey are major releases that introduce key functionalities to the Particl\necosystem and craft the path forward. They will massively contribute to\nimproving Particl and its adoption by making it more stable, resilient, private,\nand scalable. \n\nThese milestones are not necessarily intended to be worked on one right after\nthe other. They usually require other roadmap items to be completed before they\ncan be started, meaning the development focus is spread across all roadmap\ncategories and not just this one.\n\nOther Categories\nRoadmap items related to the marketplace, desktop client, SMSG network, or the\nblockchain are grouped into their own categories. They are important features,\nadditions, and improvements to the components and products of the Particl\necosystem that already exist. \n\nAlthough these roadmap items are not included in the \"major milestones\"\ncategory, they are just as important and provide direct value to the ecosystem\nand improves its adoption potential by making it more accessible, usable, and\nfeature-complete.\n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality  What?\nAn improved zap function that gives stakers more flexibility and privacy.\n\nWhy?\nThe new zap function makes it more efficient and confidential to zap funds when\nactivating cold staking. \n\nCompleted Particl Electrum  What?\nA Particl version of the Electrum light wallet, with Lightning Network GUI\nincluded.\n\nWhy?\nElectrum is an easy-to-use and popular light wallet that introduces various\nfeatures and capabilities. One of them is a GUI for using Particl's Lightning\nNetwork. Electrum will not only make it easy to use the Lightning Network, but\nit's also expected to serve as the backbone for future components of the Particl\necosystem. \n\nIn progress Taproot support  What?\nA new protocol that brings new, more efficient, flexible, and private ways to\ntransact PART.\n\nWhy?\nThe Taproot update includes many new features and capabilities, notably in the\narea of privacy. This update is particularly interesting considering the complex\ntransactions generated by Particl's apps like the marketplace and the upcoming\nBasicSwap DEX. Taproot is expected to improve their privacy even more and reduce\nfees. \n\nPending activation Trezor wallet support  What?\nA better support for Trezor hardware devices.\n\nWhy?\nTrezor is a hardware device that lets users safely store coins offline. Having\nnew hardware storage solution for Particl provides users with yet another safe\nway to store coins the way they prefer. \n\nIn progress New blockchain explorers  What?\nThe deployment of new blockchain explorers.\n\nWhy?\nMany different blockchain explorers provide additional data that Particl's\ncurrent primary blockchain explorer (Insight) doesn't. For this reason, having\nmore blockchain explorers opens up the door to new opportunities, such as\nenabling Particl's upcoming web framework. \n\nIn progress Scaling and performance upgrades  What?\nA wide range of planned improvements to make Particl more scalable, stable, and\nfast.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption grows, the ecosystem has to support the increased traffic.\nIt also needs to be able to process a large number of transactions and SMSG\nmessages. Various improvements are planned as part of the regular Particl Core\nupdates to ensure that this is the case. \n\nOngoing PSBT support  What?\nA unified and more advanced multi-signature format.\n\nWhy?\nPSBT is a more modern multi-signature protocol that improves on current\nmulti-signature solutions. It makes it easier to use for wallets and nodes, and\nmakes it compatible across more devices. PSBT also enables better CoinJoin-like\nfunctionality. \n\nShamir's secret-sharing for mnemonics (SSS)  What?\nAn improvement to how mnemonics work in deterministic wallets.\n\nWhy?\nSSS is a new, improved format for deterministic wallet mnemonics that \"splits a\nmaster secret into unique parts which can be distributed among participants. A\nspecified minimum number of parts is required to be supplied in order to\nreconstruct the original secret. Knowledge of fewer than the required number of\nparts does not leak information about the master secret.\" \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import  What?\nMore features to the current inventory import tool. Includes importing images,\ncategories, product codes, and more right from a CSV file.\n\nWhy?\nMakes it easier and less time-consuming for large-scale vendors to open shop on\nParticl Marketplace. Currently, many operations still require a manual,\none-by-one operation which is a tedious process for vendors with hundreds of\nlistings. \n\nIn progress Additional shipping and delivery options  What?\nAdditional shipping and delivery options to satisfy more needs (per country\nshipping costs, digital item deliveries, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nAdding more shipping options helps sellers charge a more accurate shipping cost\ndepending on the buyer's location and shipping preference. This roadmap item\nalso includes new delivery methods for digital items, such as buyers providing a\ncrypto address (i.e., NFTs) or a user code/username, for example. \n\nIn progress Escrow improvements  What?\nA wide range of escrow improvements to satisfy more use-cases.\n\nWhy?\nAt this time, escrow is mandatory on all transactions and requires a 100%\nsecurity deposit rate. However, its current form may not be ideal for all types\nof transactions, sellers, and buyers. For this reason, a wide range of escrow\nimprovements and options are planned to be deployed. This includes making escrow\noptional and introducing new features like an auto-destroy timer, an\nauto-complete timer, an adjustable security deposit requirement, partial\nrefunds, and automation to reduce the number of steps required in the buy flow.\nAll these escrow features are optional, leaving users with multiple options to\nsatisfy their needs. \n\nIn progress Research Advanced inventory management  What?\nAn inventory management tool that lets sellers indicate the quantity in stock\nfor each of their listings. It also lets them set up variants for items with\nmultiple purchasing options (i.e., color, size, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nThis tool significantly improves the marketplace by introducing a key e-commerce\nfeature to specify the number of available quantities. In addition, instead of\ncreating multiple listings of the same item, sellers with products containing\nvariants (i.e., storage size for USB keys) will be able to let buyers choose\ntheir purchasing preferences from a single listing. \n\nNew types of order  What?\nAdded support for new types of orders, such as bidding auctions.\n\nWhy?\nAllows the marketplace to provide a different experience for different types of\nusers, products, and niches. For example, the art industry heavily uses bidding\nauctions and may be more inclined to use the marketplace if this feature is\nenabled. \n\nPrice pegging and custom display  What?\nThe ability to dynamically adjust and display listing prices based on the value\nof other currencies (i.e., USD).\n\nWhy?\nDue to PART's price fluctuation, many users may prefer pricing and viewing\nlistings based on different currencies (i.e., USD, EUR, BTC). This roadmap item\ndepends on price oracles, which is a future functionality provided by Particl\nDesktop plugins (SMSG bots). \n\nLater Reputation system  What?\nA reputation system, best used in combination with Particl's escrow.\n\nWhy?\nBefore transacting, both the seller and the buyer want to ensure that the other\nparty is trustworthy. A reputation system is a tool that helps with making that\nassessment. It provides additional information about the other user and, when\ncombined with Particl's unique escrow system, offers a strong level of\nconfidence and protection when trading with strangers. \n\nLater Research Buy flow messaging  What?\nThe ability to talk with the other participant during a marketplace transaction.\n\nWhy?\nThere are a lot of situations where both participants of a marketplace\ntransaction may want to communicate together. Whether that's for asking a\nquestion before buying, providing an update, or dealing with a shipping issue, a\nbuilt-in messaging system massively improves the user experience and helps\nresolve order-related issues. \n\nAdditional market permissions  What?\nThe ability for a market owner to set special permissions for other users.\n\nWhy?\nA market owner may want to make their market or storefront invite-only, or they\nmay wish to elect moderators. This feature makes community markets and\nstorefronts more versatile, leading to more potential use-cases. \n\nResearch Moderation system update  What?\nImprovements to the marketplace's moderation system.\n\nWhy?\nAs no central authority has the power to control the marketplace and its\ncontent, the community is the one in charge of moderation. The current system is\na basic process that lets anyone flag undesirable content. Several improvements\nare being considered, notably in relation to cold staking pools and AI systems.\nImproving the moderation system and its capabilities will make it more effective\nand lead to more people using it. \n\nResearch Webhook integrations  What?\nThe ability for Particl Marketplace to connect with third-party services.\n\nWhy?\nWhile the marketplace is entirely decentralized, users can manually add\nthird-party services through app extensions and plugins. Webhook integrations\nare such services that can be manually added. They allow the marketplace to\nconnect to external platforms that provide services like inventory management,\naccounting, external notifications, etc. Any platform or person can deploy their\nown integration; the possibilities are endless. \n\nIn progress Other DSN integrations (i.e., IPFS)  What?\nThe ability to host large-size content like images on different data network\nsystems (DSN).\n\nWhy?\nImages make up for the majority of the data contained in SMSG messages. Hosting\nlarge-size content on external networks clears a lot of space on the SMSG\nnetwork, allowing it to scale better and be more efficient. Additionally, other\nDSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG,\nopening up the doors to more opportunities. \n\nResearch Stable payments  What?\nA way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.\n\nWhy?\nPART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users,\nespecially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve\nthe stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a\nmajor improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability.\nThis is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a\nnear-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be\nintegrated on Particl Desktop using plugins. \n\nLater Research Other features and improvements  What?\nA wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.\n\nWhy?\nA wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part\nof Particl Desktop's regular release schedule. These additions usually take less\ntime to get ready and can come up due to user feedback or problems encountered.\nA few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown\nformatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options,\noptional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time. The\nteam wants to keep a flexible approach to development and expects a few features\nand improvements to require to be added suddenly. \n\nOngoing Desktop\nSMSG controller  What?\nA system that allows apps and developers to interact with the SMSG network more\neffectively.\n\nWhy?\nA streamlined process for interacting with the SMSG network is required for apps\nand developers to easily and safely interact with the SMSG network. The SMSG\nmanager also provides various failsafe mechanisms and massively increases SMSG's\ncompatibility with future apps other than the marketplace. It's an important\nstep towards making Particl more developer-friendly. \n\nCore and Desktop separation  What?\nBetter separation of Particl Core and Particl Desktop.\n\nWhy?\nMaking Particl Desktop even more independent of Particl Core makes the client\nmore efficient. This improves the quality of the code making other features and\nfunctionalities easier to maintain and deploy. \n\nApp extensions and plugins  What?\nSupport for app extensions and plugins to provide third-party functionalities to\nthe desktop client.\n\nWhy?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized network and functions without any\nthird-party intervention. However, intermediaries may provide helpful services\nand features that may benefit users (i.e., data oracles, crypto swap services,\netc.). The app extension and plugin system lets anyone broadcast and add\nthird-party services on Particl Desktop. \n\nCore configuration editor  What?\nA system that lets users modify configuration settings, such as easily enabling\nTor routing.\n\nWhy?\nManually editing Particl Core configuration files can provide a lot of extra\nfunctionalities to users, but it can also break things in unexpected ways. A\nconfig management system lets the user tweak these low-level settings without\nany potential issue. This can be useful, for example, to easily connect to the\nTor network. \n\nIn progress Wallet encryption options  What?\nThe ability to delete the encryption of a wallet or change its password.\n\nWhy?\nThere are many situations where a user may want to delete the encryption of a\nwallet or change its password. This is what this roadmap item introduces. \n\nBetter cold staking functionality  What?\nMove staking and cold staking to a separate section or app.\n\nWhy?\nMaking a separate section or app for staking (and cold staking) allows for a\nbetter way to provide more options and features. This makes staking and cold\nstaking more intuitive and powerful. \n\nOS notifications  What?\nThe addition of various push notifications to the user's operating system.\n\nWhy?\nReceiving notifications through your operating system lets you stay connected\nand up-to-date with what's going on with your Particl-related activities.\nNotifications can be pushed for many different events such as a marketplace\norder update, an inbound PART transaction, a completed escrow, etc. \n\nWant to Suggest a New Feature or Improvement?\nYour feedback and ideas are incredibly valuable! If you have any feature,\nimprovement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know\nabout it.\n\nSimply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., Particl Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] or Particl Core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues]), and create a new issue with\nthe \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer\nwill see your suggestion.\n\nKeep Track of Things\nTo keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every\nweek on Friday, a development progress report on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the\ndevelopments and updates. \n\nThis roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new Particl.io\n[https://Particl.io/] website. It will be regularly updated as new items are\nadded, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. \n\nBasicSwap Open Beta\nBasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a\ncross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the\nSMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC,\nand others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed\nbeta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having\ntaken place during the last few weeks.\n\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required\ntweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it\ncan be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.\n\nAs we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect\nmuch more information about it to be released shortly on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become\ninvincible!\n\nWeb Framework\nMaking Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the\nweb with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making\nParticl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of\nadoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.\n\nHowever, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other\nvital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more\nfunctional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential\nroadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more\nimmediate focus.\n\nAdditionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as\nalternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required\nto fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as\n\"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate\npriority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. \n\nJust like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information\nabout it when its time comes.\n\nWhat About Marketing?\nNow that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on\nmainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness\ncampaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few\ninitiatives already being live and with many more in line.\n\nOn that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about\nParticl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and\nadoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on\nParticl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the\nplatform successful.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nstill in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and\ncomplicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is\nintended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the\naudiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with\nthe features available at the time.\n\nThe New Website is Key\nThe new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is\nwhere newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are\nthe most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's\nmost crucial marketing statement.\n\nTo that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one,\nimproving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much\nclearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on\nParticl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the\nproject has to offer to them.\n\nWe are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the\nconversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in\nmaking future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.\n\n> Note: Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new\nwebsite release to next week. One of our team members involved with its\ndevelopment has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several\ndays this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time.\nThis team member is now recovering fine.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser may be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e., search engine friendly content) will be added over time.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Encrypted messaging app</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            The SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network.

Hosting large-size content on external networks clears a lot of space on the SMSG network, allowing it to scale better and be more efficient. Additionally, other DSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG, opening up the doors to more opportunities.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck13\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck13\">Stable payments</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            PART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users, especially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve the stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a major improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability. This is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a near-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be integrated on Particl Desktop using plugins.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck14\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck14\">Other features and improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            A wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part of Particl Desktop's regular release schedule.

A few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown formatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options, optional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time.

If you have any feature, improvement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know about it.</p><p>Simply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Particl Desktop</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\">Particl Core</a>), and create a new issue with the \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer will see your suggestion.</p><h3 id=\"keep-track-of-things\">Keep Track of Things</h3><p>To keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every week on Friday, a development progress report on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the developments and updates. </p><p>This roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new <a href=\"https://Particl.io/\">Particl.io</a> website. It will be regularly updated as new items are added, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. </p><h2 id=\"basicswap-open-beta\">BasicSwap Open Beta</h2><p>BasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag represents a different status.</p><ul><li><strong>Completed: </strong>The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant version of it has been deployed.</li><li><strong>In progress:</strong> The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already started being worked on.</li><li><strong>Research:</strong> The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently under research.</li><li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.</li><li><strong>Later:</strong> The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap items in the list.</li><li><strong>[NO TAG]:</strong> The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment, but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>Major Milestones</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            BasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally.

Additionally, other DSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG, opening up the doors to more opportunities.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck13\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck13\">Stable payments</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            PART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users, especially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve the stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a major improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability. This is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a near-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be integrated on Particl Desktop using plugins.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck14\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck14\">Other features and improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            A wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part of Particl Desktop's regular release schedule.

A few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown formatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options, optional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time.

If you have any feature, improvement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know about it.</p><p>Simply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Particl Desktop</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\">Particl Core</a>), and create a new issue with the \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer will see your suggestion.</p><h3 id=\"keep-track-of-things\">Keep Track of Things</h3><p>To keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every week on Friday, a development progress report on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the developments and updates. </p><p>This roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new <a href=\"https://Particl.io/\">Particl.io</a> website. It will be regularly updated as new items are added, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. </p><h2 id=\"basicswap-open-beta\">BasicSwap Open Beta</h2><p>BasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Now that Particl’s free, unrestricted, and private\nmarketplace has arrived, it’s time to make some noise know about it!\n\nWith the renewal of funding for the team, we have begun to gradually ramp up\nmarketing, promotional, and strategical efforts to turn Particl Marketplace into\na busy place.\n\nNew Website About to Go Live\nAs part of these efforts, we're launching, next week, the first version of\nParticl’s new website. This new website is expected to grow and evolve in the\nweeks to come and aims at better communicating Particl’s vision of a free,\nunrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman, along with\nall the benefits it unlocks.\n\nNew Roadmap\nThe team has established a new roadmap for technical development, marketing, and\nbusiness development. It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and\nobjectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog\npost this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021. We’ve mentioned it a few\ntimes already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re\nconvinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take\nParticl to the next level.\n\nBasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX\nAs occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve\nbeen making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl:\nBasicSwap.\n\nBasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps\nand Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means\nthat it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain\nto another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment\nprocessor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people\nand are inherently private and autonomous.\n\nBasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but\nalready running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly. So\nkeep your eyes fixated on Particl News as we soon begin to publish more\ninformation about it.\n\nMuch More to Come\nThe points mentioned above are sure exciting, but it’s far from the only things\nbeing cooked up at the moment. You can expect more promotional efforts,\ninitiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come. While we\ndon’t want to repeat ourselves too much, the fun is getting started, and the\nbest is yet to come!\n\nYou are the Pioneer!\nThere’s never been a better time to get active and introduce others to the\nworld's most revolutionary marketplace. We need all the buyers and seller we can\nget! So let’s all discuss it with friends and families, in your communities, and\non the web, in places you feel would benefit the most from a fair, unrestricted,\nand private e-commerce environment with no middleman. We are ALL what makes\nParticl happen!\n\nAnd don’t forget! To make it easier, the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/] is there to help you out when introducing Particl\nto others. With its help on your side, you can now turn anybody into a Particl\npro and quickly get them started.\n\nFinally, we highly encourage you to support our current pioneering vendors by\nbuying items from them or referring others to Particl Marketplace.

Now that Particl’s free, unrestricted, and private marketplace has arrived, it’s time to make some noise know about it!</p><p>With the renewal of funding for the team, we have begun to gradually ramp up marketing, promotional, and strategical efforts to turn Particl Marketplace into a busy place.</p><h2 id=\"new-website-about-to-go-live\">New Website About to Go Live</h2><p>As part of these efforts, we're launching, next week, the first version of Particl’s new website. This new website is expected to grow and evolve in the weeks to come and aims at better communicating Particl’s vision of a free, unrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman, along with all the benefits it unlocks.</p><h2 id=\"new-roadmap\">New Roadmap</h2><p>The team has established a new roadmap for technical development, marketing, and business development. It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and objectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog post <strong>this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021</strong>. We’ve mentioned it a few times already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re convinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take Particl to the next level.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-atomic-swap-dex\">BasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX</h2><p>As occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve been making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl: BasicSwap.</p><p>BasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps and Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means that it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain to another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment processor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people and are inherently private and autonomous.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1000w, /glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1435w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>BasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but already running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly. So keep your eyes fixated on Particl News as we soon begin to publish more information about it.</p><h2 id=\"much-more-to-come\">Much More to Come</h2><p>The points mentioned above are sure exciting, but it’s far from the only things being cooked up at the moment. You can expect more promotional efforts, initiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come. While we don’t want to repeat ourselves too much, the fun is getting started, and the best is yet to come!</p><h1 id=\"you-are-the-pioneer-\">You are the Pioneer!</h1><p>There’s never been a better time to get active and introduce others to the world's most revolutionary marketplace. We need all the buyers and seller we can get! So let’s all discuss it with friends and families, in your communities, and on the web, in places you feel would benefit the most from a fair, unrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman. We are ALL what makes Particl happen!</p><p>And don’t forget! To make it easier, the <strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/\">Particl Academy</a></strong> is there to help you out when introducing Particl to others. With its help on your side, you can now turn anybody into a Particl pro and quickly get them started.</p><p>Finally, we highly encourage you to support our current pioneering vendors by buying items from them or referring others to Particl Marketplace.

This would make\nboth of them much easier to use, more flexible, secure, private, and, perhaps\nmore importantly, set the stage for getting adoption from a broader range of\naudiences. This major and long-awaited upgrade is what is now known as “Particl\nV3”. \n\nWe are excited to announce, today, that Particl V3 is going live, on mainnet, on\nthe 29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC! \n\nThanks to all of you in the community for your support, time, passion,\nexperience, and dedication in helping out, testing, and engaging in constructive\nconversations that help shape the future of e-commerce and personal liberties.\nYou are what makes Particl's mission possible; our hats are off to you!\n\nNow let's go over a few basic information you need to know in preparation for\nthe mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhere will it be available?\nParticl V3 refers to the new Particl Desktop (3.0.0) client which gives access\nto the new Particl Marketplace and community governance module. And so, to use\nthe marketplace, you will need to install the latest version of Particl Desktop,\nwhich will be available on the official Particl website\n[https://particl.io/downloads] and the project’s Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] on the 29th of September\n2021 at 12:00 UTC.\n\nWhat can I do to prepare?\nFinalize open orders on previous versions of the marketplace\nParticl V3 is the biggest update to Particl ever since the project was launched\nin 2017. And because the scope of the changes is so large, orders and listings\ncreated on previous versions won't be compatible with Particl V3.\n\nFor this reason, we highly recommend finalizing any open marketplace order on\nprevious versions. But don’t worry, if you have open orders that you cannot\ncomplete at this moment (i.e., the escrow smart-contract is still locked),\nyou’ll be able to switch between Particl Desktop 2.x.x and Particl 3.x.x freely,\nat any time, to finalize orders even if you’ve started using Particl V3.\n\nSpread the good word around you\nWith the long-anticipated Particl V3 release now having an official mainnet\nrelease date, now’s the time to inform people around you and talk about all the\nbenefits that private and unrestricted e-commerce without middlemen offers.\n\nTo support your communication efforts after the release, you'll be able to point\npotential newcomers to the Particl Academy.\n\nThe Particl Academy is Coming!\nTo support the mainnet release of Particl V3, the Particl Academy will launch on\nthe same day (29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC).\n\nThe Particl Academy is your guide to becoming an expert in distributed\ne-commerce with Particl Marketplace. It gives you all the information you need\nto master Particl V3 and the other components of the Particl ecosystem. It’s a\nthorough reference book written in simple and straightforward language that\nanybody can understand.\n\nIf you show Particl to someone new, don’t forget to point them to the Particl\nAcademy! That'll let them quickly learn about it and guide them through their\nfirst steps.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we'd like to invite you to subscribe to our\nnewsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive\ncontent. \n\nAlong with the Particl V3 mainnet release, we are re-initiating our newsletter\ncommunication. We will be pushing news, stories, and other valuable content\nthrough it from now on and subscribing is a perfect way not to miss anything\nimportant.\n\n * Subscribe to Particl's newsletter here: https://bit.ly/3CgyB3q\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee You on Mainnet!\nParticl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of\nParticl is being built; it's just the beginning! \n\nWe also want to remind you to stay tuned as we will release a new,\ngroundbreaking roadmap shortly after the mainnet release of Particl V3. We are\nconvinced that you will be as excited as we are about the path forward. The next\nfew milestones are all about increasing Particl’s accessibility, usability,\nscalability, and, of course, adoption.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your incredible support and confidence throughout the\nentire development cycle of Particl V3. Positive words, constructive feedback,\nand discussions are critical to the success of the Particl ecosystem. We are\nblessed to have you as such a dedicated and passionate community and we're very\nexcited to walk through this journey with you all!\n\nLet’s now make sure to spread the word about the upcoming release to get as many\neyes as possible on it, and let’s blast through the next phase of the project.\nThe best is yet to come and it starts on the 29th of this month!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Notably interesting\nis the new addition of the governance module on testnet, we encourage you to\ncheck it out!\n\nIf you encounter any problem while testing this new version of Particl V3 or\nhave feedback to give, please add a \"new issue\" on Github (click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new/choose]). Make sure to\nexplain in detail the problem you’ve encountered, how to reproduce it, and the\nOS you’re using.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground.\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nChangelog\nWhat follows is a list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements made to Particl\nV3 since the last testnet release. This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nGovernance Module\n * Enable the governance module for testing.\n * Fixed an issue where graphs were not displaying in release builds.\n\nMarket Module\n * Publishing fee estimates now correctly include the image fees.\n * Filtering for expired listings in Sell > Listings page now works correctly.\n * A warning is now displayed when there may be insufficient utxos (but\n   sufficient total funds) to publish a listing AND all its images. The ability\n   to still continue with the publish is possible, but requires the seller to\n   explicitly indicate that this is acceptable.\n * Updated the csv product import functionality to attempt to match on country\n   name (English only for now) instead of just the ISO code.\n * The csv product import now allows for specifying the \"shipping to\"\n   destinations countries in a comma separated list.\n * The market summary text of a market shown in the Joined Markets section is\n   now selectable.\n * Includes changes made to particl-marketplace service such as...\n * Fixed an error that prevented a bid from being placed if all the images of\n   the item in question had not been properly received.\n * Fixed an error that caused the buyflow to become stuck due to the buyer\n   cancelling the purchase arrangement but the seller completing the escrow\n   state prior to receiving the cancellation action.\n * The particl-marketplace service now has some time on termination to attempt\n   to gracefully shut itself down, instead of terminating processing immediately\n   (and potentially causing issues with the processing of messages).\n * Remove the lookup for an existing \"market\" named wallet to create the initial\n   profile/identity wallets from when initializing the service for the first\n   time: this potentially causes errors and requires manual user intervention if\n   the named \"market\" wallet is encrypted and locked during the service\n   initialization.\n\nWallet Module\n * Updated the zap functionality (cold staking) to cater to additional user\n   options.\n * Changed wording on the transaction table entries to make more sense when fees\n   are involved: this includes fees paid for smsg fees (eg: publishing listings\n   via smsg) and zap transaction fees.\n * The restore wallet flow now caters to 12 word mnemonic inputs.\n\nGeneral\n * Added additional messages to message of the day.\n * Spelling and other grammar updates.\n * Update and unify usage of the zmq library dependency.\n * Application crashes should now be handled correctly: instead of receiving a\n   nasty JS error prompt, the error is logged and a friendlier window is\n   displayed indicating that the application has crashed. This is a temporary\n   stopgap change that leads into better logging and user visibility into what\n   the application is doing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and assistance in testing this new version of Particl\nV3.

It introduces a significant update to the cold staking \"zap\"\nscript, hardware wallet support for Trezor devices, as well as a good variety of\nimprovements and minor fixes.\n\n * Download link: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.13 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213Hashes1d43c6f75af5daefdde50376f2cbe4e38a4683e288bbe37c9fadf9aff76ff282\nparticl-0.19.2.13-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13]As always, we\nhighly recommend keeping your node(s) and wallet(s) up-to-date with Particl's\nlatest version. If you're using the cold staking application Partyman, you can\nupdate by entering the partyman/partyman update command from your home folder or \n./partyman update from inside your partyman folder.\n\nYou can verify the full list of additions by checking out the release notes\nhere: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCold Staking \"Zap\" Feature Update\nThe zap feature lets you delegate the entirety of your staking outputs to an\nexternal cold staking node. While it has been available for several years, this\nParticl Core update improves its behavior and adds to it a new, very useful\nfeature.\n\nIndeed, it is now possible to choose whether you want your zap to be more\nprivate (doesn't use and mix inputs from different addresses in a single zapping\ntransaction) or instantly get optimal staking performances (default behavior). \n\nIt is currently possible to use the improved zap feature on Particl Core\n(although not directly supported in Particl Qt's wallet interface), but it will\nonly be available on Particl Desktop on the mainnet release of Particl V3.\nPrevious versions of Particl Desktop still work using the older version of the\nzap feature.\n\nIf you want to use the zap script without Particl Desktop, you can use this\nscript that is available on Github: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl_scripts/blob/main/zap.py.\n\nHardware Support for Trezor Devices \nThis Particl Core update also adds support for Trezor devices. Please note that\nour integration is not yet officially supported by Trezor itself, but the new\ncore update provides the code required for it.\n\nThe implementation supports incoming blind (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions,\nmeaning you'll be able to privately send your funds to your device using\nhardware hardening, but without compromising your privacy while doing so. \n\nNote that, although it supports incoming privacy transactions (from an anon or\nblind balance to a public balance), the Trezor implementation will itself only\nsupport public balances, at least for the initial implementation.\n\nWe will communicate more details about official support from Trezor as soon as\nwe can!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core 0.22 Coming Soon!\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert has been catching up with Bitcoin's codebase\nat lightning-fast pace. In fact, Particl Core has, as of today, caught up to\nBitcoin's 0.22 code.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\n[Governance module] Introduces a new governance module that allows for viewing\nactive and upcoming CCS proposals that require a network vote, as well as past\nproposals. Voting on a current or future proposal is currently available,\nalthough not enabled when using a cold staking wallet (the vote should rather be\ncast on the cold staking node). Further, detailed information on the proposals\nand how to vote is included in the module. While the governance module is\nincluded in this release, it has been temporarily disabled - this is not a bug\n\n[Market module] Removes the unused and invalid publishing controls in the\nproduct import wizard.\n\n[Market module] Images are displayed alongside the market name, if available, in\nadditional places in the product creation and publishing areas.\n\n[Market module] Removes the display of a 'ROOT' parent category that was\ndisplayed on items in the cart.\n\n[Market module] Replaces usage of the word 'bid' with 'order request' and\n'order' where appropriate, to avoid confusion ('bid' terminology is confusing,\nwith 'order request' more accurately aligning with the behaviour).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error in the GUI preventing the joining of a market\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n[Market module] When a listing item is flagged, all exact duplicates of the\nlisting item in the same market are now flagged as well. When a new duplicate of\nan already flagged item is received for the same market, it will be flagged as\nwell.\n\n[Market module] Fixes a case in the Listing Details where action buttons were\nnot disabling correctly when another action is being processed and taking some\ntime to complete.\n\n[Market module] Adds the ability to export to CSV a list of sell orders. The\nsell orders exported are those currently displayed; sell orders exported are\ninfluenced by any search and filtering criteria applied).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an issue preventing publishing items to a market with a 0\nvalue for either of the shipping prices.\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error whereby the wrong favorite item may be removed\nwhile attempting to remove a favorite item.\n\n[Market module] Reduces the number of stealth addresses used per wallet/identity\nthroughout the marketplace.\n\n[Market module] Adds additional validation to market message order sequencing.\n\n[Wallet module] Prevents the user from navigating to another app/module in\ncertain steps of the wallet creation: this prevents issues with potentially\nusing an uninitialized wallet in other app/module (i.e., the Governance module).\n\n[General] Fixes the zmq.node error on some versions of Windows that prevented\nthe application from opening.\n\n[General] Attempts a fix at a possible intermittent issue where the connection\nevent may not be properly processed and thus the application fails to start\ncorrectly. Further testing and feedback may be necessary.\n\n[General] Display a random \"message of the day\" on the welcome screen. The\ncurrent number of messages is limited, but can be added to in the future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf this testing round goes well and no other major issue is identified in the\nnext couple of days, Particl V3 will be ready for mainnet very shortly. We will\nclearly communicate the mainnet release date on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and within the usual communications channels.\n\nSo let's get testing and keep an eye out for the confirmation on the release\ndate very soon!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal requested 35,250 PART per month from the treasury for 6\nmonths, after which a new funding request will need to be pushed by the team and\napproved by stakeholders.\n\nWe are happy to report that Particl stakeholders have approved this proposal \nwith a solid 98.6% approval rate (minimum required was 60%) and a 64%\nparticipation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 5,040 blocks,\nwith 3,191 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 46 voting against it.\n\nWhen Will the Team Start Claiming Funds\nWith the funding request now approved, the team can now claim funds from the\ntreasury according to its stated schedule. However, because the new treasury\nmodel has just gone live today (read the Hardfork Successful\n[https://particl.news/july-2021-hardfork-successful/] blog post for more\ndetails), which is in the middle of July, the team will only start claiming\nfunds at the end of August. That means that the first month out of the six\nrequested by the team’s funding request will be August. The proposal then\nexpires after the month of January 2022, which is the last month out of the six\nwhere the Particl team will claim funds. A new funding request will then be\npublished and will need to be approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nIn the meantime, the team will use the remaining days of July to finalize the\ndeployment of the new legal entity, finish up the new website, and get\neverything ready for August and onward. Within that period, the team will also\nprepare the new roadmap for public release and explain, in detail, the reasoning\nbehind it and the objectives that motivate it. Spoiler alert, it is simply\namazing, and we can’t wait to share it with you all!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You For Your Trust\nThis particular proposal was the first-ever funding request for the new treasury\nmodel. Because the community entirely owns the treasury’s fund, this proposal\nasked for much more than just coins to support the project; it asked for the\ncommunity’s trust and stamp of approval.\n\nWith this in mind, we want to thank every one of you in the community for this\nvote of confidence and for participating in this democratic exercise. We are all\nvery excited to move past the mainnet release of Particl V3 and get down to some\nserious business!\n\nLet’s take Particl to the literal next level and deliver to the world a truly\ndecentralized, private, secure, and free e-commerce platform that is easy to\nuse.

This is a very important milestone for Particl as the\nhardfork introduces various changes and re-enables the ability to conduct blind\nand anon transactions.\n\nThis blog post will summarize everything brought by the hardfork and provide an\nupdate on the claims submitted by users who had coins temporarily disabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Has Hardforked\nToday, on Monday the 12th of July, 2021, at 17:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain\nhas successfully hardforked. This event officially turns the page on the\nunfortunate exploit on the chain that led to the creation of fraudulent coins\nout of thin air.\n\nFor an overview of the exploit and its disclosure, please head over to this\nParticl News blog post [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/].\nFor a summary of the solutions that have been deployed, please check out this\none [https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\n> Note: If your Particl Core node is not updated to Particl Core 0.19.2.12, then\nit means you are now staking on the wrong chain. Any staking reward earned on\nthe wrong chain won't count on the correct chain, and you won't be able to send\nor receive payments from other people. Updating to Particl Core 0.19.2.12 is\nmandatory.\nBlind and Anon Transactions Re-Enabled\nOne of the two main components of this hardfork is the re-enabling of blind and\nanon transactions. In addition, the hardfork also re-enables the majority of\nanon and blind balances that were temporarily disabled to stop the attacker from\ncausing further damage on the blockchain.\n\nIn other words, you can now freely make blind and anon transactions once again\nand use Particl Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2. The hardfork also enables\nParticl V3 to go live on mainnnet as it relies on blind and anon transactions.\nMore details on this very soon!\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Low Pass Filter\nIf you had coins on blind and/or anon balances when the vulnerability was\nannounced and fixed, then they have been temporarily disabled up until today. To\nre-enable them, the Particl team deployed a “low pass filter” which\nautomatically re-enables any output with 200 or fewer coins.\n\nTo re-enable temporarily disabled coins using the low pass filter, you will need\nto enter the following command, once for every disabled output, in your Particl\nclient’s debug window.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 220 disabled coins separated into two 110 PART outputs,\nyou will need to enter the above command twice in a row. You need to use Particl\nCore 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Manual Claim Process\nIf you have disabled blind and anon outputs that contain more than 200 coins,\nyou were required to manually submit a claim to the team to include it in the\nwhitelist. If that’s your case, and you’ve submitted a claim, then your outputs\nhave been whitelisted, and you can now spend them. To do just that, you will\nneed to follow the same step as with the low pass filter.\n\nFor every disabled output you have, you need to type in the following command.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 1,000 coins that are currently disabled, spread into 4\noutputs of 250 PART each, you will need to type the above command 4 times. You\nneed to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nManual Claim Process Update\nTo be as transparent as possible, we’d like to provide a full update on the\nmanual claim process and its impact on Particl’s circulating supply.\n\nThroughout the entire span of the claim process, a total of 12 claims have been\nsubmitted to the team. Each claim has been thoroughly inspected and audited. We\nare happy to say that all submitted claims appear legitimate and that none of\nthem traced back to fraudulent or suspicious outputs. The submitted claims\neither traced back to their public origin, were accompanied by a proof of\npurchase, or had the typical cryptography one would expect from legitimate\noutputs.\n\nFor this reason, all claims been approved by both the team and the community\ngroup of validators. This claim process results in an additional\n810,588.43967605 PART being added to the supply, bringing it to a current total\nof ~11,411,000 PART. This doesn’t take any coin re-enabled through the low pass\nfilter into account.\n\n> Note: Particl’s block explorer [https://explorer.particl.io/status] currently\ndisplays a smaller circulating supply value than what is stated above. That’s\nbecause it doesn’t see disabled coins from users who haven’t yet executed the\ncommand to re-enable them. Every time users manually re-enable their coins, the\nblock explorer will dynamically adjust its circulating supply value.\nNew Treasury Model is Live\nThe second principal component of this hardfork is the activation of Particl’s\nnew and decentralized treasury model, which provides the ecosystem with\nperpetual PART revenue. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/] for more details.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]As a\nresult of this successful hardfork, anyone can now submit funding requests on\nParticl’s CCS platform to fund and support initiatives that directly benefit the\necosystem. Any funding request has to be approved by Particl stakeholders\nthrough an on-chain vote for the funds to be allocated from the treasury.\n\nIf you want to submit a proposal, please head over to the CCS platform\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] and read the instructions provided on there.\n\nIncrease in Staking Rewards\nAs part of the new treasury model, staking rewards are also getting a bump.\nIndeed, as of today, Particl’s emission rate has increased from 2% per year to\n8%, with half of the rewards going directly into the Treasury Fund.\n\nThat means that, as an individual staker, your staking rewards double from 2%\nper year to a minimum of 4%. But, of course, the actual yield rewarded to you\nfrom staking PART varies depending on how many more PART coins are being staked\nby other people. If, for example, only 50% of all PART coins stake on the\nnetwork, then you can expect your annual returns to be closer to 8% than 4%. You\ncan use CryptoID’s useful extraction tool\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!extraction] to track the percentage of all\nPART coins being staked by their owner.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would like to thank you all for your incredible support and\nunderstanding through this challenging series of events. As we officially turn\nthe page on the vulnerability exploit with the hardfork, the team is excited to\nmove forward once again and spend its time growing and promoting the Particl\necosystem.\n\nStay tuned as we near the mainnet release of Particl V3 and soon release a bunch\nof exciting news, including the new roadmap, on Particl News.\n\nWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and that’s precisely the case here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Particl Core 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12], which is now\nreleased in full, is the client that activates the hardfork. Exchanges have been\ncontacted, and have agreed to go ahead with the hardfork as planned.\n\nThis marks an important milestone for Particl as it turns the page on the\ninflationary bug discovered earlier this year and deploys the new decentralized\ntreasury model to fund and support the Particl ecosystem.\n\n> Note 1: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] if you haven’t\nalready done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will lead you to\nconnect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other people will\nnot be relayed, and you won’t be able to use anon/blind balances or Particl\nMarketplace.\n> Note 2: If you are casting your vote for the proposal currently going through\nits voting period (the first team funding request\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-vote-scheduled/]), then that means\nthat you are already using Particl Core 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If that's the\ncase, there is nothing more for you to do, you're already all set!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s this Hardfork About?\nThis coming hardfork, scheduled for the 12th of July, 2021 at 17:00 UTC and\nactivated by Particl Core 0.19.2.12, has two primary purposes.\n\nRe-Enabling Temporarily Disabled Anon and Blind Balances\nParticl Vulnerability DisclosureLearn everything about Particl’s recent\nvulnerability discovery and emergency hardfork.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]The Particl team\nnoticed, in February 2021, a discrepancy between the expected and the observed\nsupply. Indeed, it was found that there were more coins in circulation than\nthere should.\n\nThe team immediately investigated the situation and discovered that an attacker\nhad exploited the chain. This allowed a hacker to create a certain number of\ncoins out of thin air to sell them on the trading markets. The bug that made\nthis possible was located and fixed in an emergency hardfork, leading to anon\nand blind balances being temporarily disabled.\n\nThe hardfork re-enables legitimate anon and blind balances while keeping\nexploited ones disabled.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model Activation\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]\nAdditionally, the Particl community recently approved a new treasury model to\nprovide the ecosystem with a decentralized and perpetual source of PART income.\nThis allows anyone to create and publish proposals on the CCS platform and get\ntheir initiative(s) funded if approved by the community through an on-chain\nvote.\n\nThe hardfork activates this new treasury model live on mainnet.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and land on the proper chain, all\nyou need to do is update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.12 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212Hashes8381f9a3f00c4515c32f87d9a66cc04ce3de2ad1aad95171e7c4cd99d91b46dc\nparticl-0.19.2.12-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] * Download\n   link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12\n\nThis version is already live, as a full release, and you can download it\ndirectly on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If you are\ncold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, simply enter\nthis command to update your node: cd ~/partyman && ./partyman update.\n\nOnce you’ve updated your node, you don’t need to do anything else. You’ll\nhardfork on the 12th of July, at 17:00 UTC, with the rest of the network. The\nhardfork is an entirely automatic process as long as you’re running the correct\ncore version.\n\nAnything Else Included in the Hardfork?\nThe two main items of this hardfork have been detailed in the first section of\nthis blog post, after the introduction. However, a few other minor items are\nincluded, which are available in the release notes of Particl Core 0.19.2.12.\nYou can simply follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212] \nto get the full list of additions included in this release.\n\nMaking Particl V3’s Mainnet Release Possible\nAn important but indirect result of this hardfork is that it will make the\nmainnet release of Particl V3 possible. Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on\nmainnet up until the hardfork.\n\nThat’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client,\nuses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling\nescrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind\nbalances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.\n\nAs the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and\nthus able to be released on mainnet.\n\nAs an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one\nweek after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3\nrelease ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as\nsmoothly as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and\nwants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through\nthis unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are\nincredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the\nParticl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.\n\nFollowing the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new\npost-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the\necosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.\n\nWe cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized\ne-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience! So stay awesome, and let’s rock the\nmonths and years to come, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on mainnet up until the hardfork.</p><p>That’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client, uses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling escrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind balances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.</p><p>As the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and thus able to be released on mainnet.</p><p>As an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one week after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3 release ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as smoothly as possible.</p><hr><p>The entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and wants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through this unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are incredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the Particl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.</p><p>Following the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new post-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the ecosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.</p><p>We cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized e-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience!

It requests\n35,250 PART per month from the treasury fund for a period of 6 months only\nafter\nwhich the team will submit a new funding...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]Over the past few weeks, the Particl team has proposed an out-of-the-box\nstrategy to fund the development and expansion of the Particl ecosystem and the\nteam’s operations [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/].\n\nThe strategy consists of a new decentralized treasury model that gets\nautomatically funded by the protocol using a portion of the network’s staking\nrewards. Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then\nsubmit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the\ntreasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote. This\nprovides the Particl ecosystem with an adequate PART income source intended to\nsupport and enhance the Particl project.\n\nFor a project, idea, or initiative to be funded from the Treasury Fund, it needs\nto be first published on the CCS platform as a proposal, and then, go through an\non-chain voting round. That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing\nits funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds\nthat will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related\noperations for a duration of 6 months.\n\nParticl Team’s Funding Request\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250\nPART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this\nperiod expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to\npublish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\nAlthough this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring\nmore financial stability and security to the project.\n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide\nfunding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different\npurposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended\nto be split.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0),\n   BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities.\n * Management, legal, and administration (8%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (12%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange\n   listing budgets.\n\nThe Team's Vision Moving Forward\nIn the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount\nof capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on\ndevelopment. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl\nMarketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking,\nand the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.\n\nOther areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and\ncommunity growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to\nthese areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s\nprecisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.\n\nMore Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth\nParticl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its\nblockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the\nway they deserve. That’s all about to change!\n\nAs part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed\nfrom the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives\naimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will\nestablish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.\n\nAdditionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and\nis scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.\n\nSupporting and Expanding the Team\nFor the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal\nrestructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized\ntreasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we\nhave identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have\nworked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding\nallows it.\n\nThis restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership,\ncommunications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic\nobjectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.\n\nAt the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members\nto be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.\n\n * Cryptoguard — Project management and communications\n * Gerlof van Ek (crz) — Project and development management, Lead Designer,\n   UI/UX, and front-end developer\n * Imran — Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships\n * Henk Swardt — Development management and coordinator\n * Tecnovert — Lead core developer\n * Arnold Bansemer — Lead desktop developer\n * Kewde — Marketplace developer, OMP, and core\n * Juha Kovanen — Marketplace developer\n * Martin — UI & UX integration and front-end developer\n * Dros — Marketing, branding, and business research & development\n * Dasource — Technical research & development\n\nNote: More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents\nthe current situation at the time of writing this blog post.\n\nTeam Expansion\nFunding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A\ngreater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or\ncontracting work with partners.\n\nThe expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically\ndeployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.\n\nAdditionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its\nadvisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.\n\nEncouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions\nAlthough the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its\noperations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led\ngovernance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its\nlevel of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led\ninitiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.\n\nTo that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools,\ndocumentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new\nideas and projects.\n\nBudgets and Expenses\nInfrastructure Expenses\n“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to\nassure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited\nto, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain\nregistrations, server maintenance, etc. \n\nAt the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a\npersonal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are\nintended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off\nindividual team members.\n\nBudgets\n\n“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that\nthe team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl\necosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not\ninclude team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.\n\nMarketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)\n\n * Content Creation, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube,\n   social media channels, and other mediums.\n * Digital Ads, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e.,\n   Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.\n * Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program, to grow the number of active vendors\n   on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.\n\nMarketing Funds (Event-based)\n\n * Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards, to help grow the project with new\n   members/users and keep things interesting within the community.\n * Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, to increase Particl’s exposure by\n   leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).\n * Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns, to increase Particl’s exposure in\n   blockchain and technology-related media.\n * Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), to increase\n   Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.\n\nExchange Listings and Partnerships Fund\n\n * Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, to get Particl listed on\n   quality exchanges and other third-party services.\n * Partnership and team collaboration funds, to ease the establishment of\n   partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.\n\nLegal Fund\n\n * Legal costs, to pay for any required legal services.\n * Corporate fees, to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.\n\nEach month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the\nParticl team from the treasury model.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific\nbudget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for\nexample, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that\nprecisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will\nremain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that\nspecific budget to be used later on, as needed.\n\nAlthough these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as\nwe progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the\nnumber of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly\nreviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward.\nNew budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team\nwants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation\nand to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.\n\nThe Reserve Fund\nAny extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries,\nexpenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This\nincludes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources\nof income for the team.\n\nThis Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against\nsudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is\nexpected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing\nsafety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.\n\nA New Legal Entity to Support the Project\nTo support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with\nany legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly\njurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over\nthe previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug,\nSwitzerland.\n\n * A more flexible legal entity operating within a well-respected and\n   pro-blockchain jurisdiction.\n * Clear and progressive legal guidance for blockchain and cryptocurrency\n   projects.\n * More financially efficient structure with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller\n   monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.\n\nThis new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such\nas acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges),\nholding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury,\nemitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments\n(i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases\n(i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.\n\nThe Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed\nagreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set\nup the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new\nlegal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal\nends so that the project can move forward swiftly.\n\nNote: The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not\nresponsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.\n\nLet’s Summarize\nThere’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this\nproposal gets you.\n\n * Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more\n   defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings\n   overall quality improvement in all business areas.\n * Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will\n   significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.\n * Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development,\n   marketing, legal, business, etc.\n * New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing\n   on the products and their benefits.\n * Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors\n   and customers.\n * Commitment to grow the user base and community.\n * Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges,\n   third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.\n\nWith the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the\nParticl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make\nit stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the\nParticl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of\nmarketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following \nthis link [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]. \n\nThe proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so\nplease leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or\ncomment.

Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then submit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the treasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote.

That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing its funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds that will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related operations for a duration of 6 months.</p><h2 id=\"particl-team-s-funding-request\">Particl Team’s Funding Request</h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>This funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1. Although this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring more financial stability and security to the project.</p><p>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide funding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\">Funding Distribution Breakdown</h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended to be split.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (8%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (12%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange listing budgets.</li></ul><h2 id=\"the-team-s-vision-moving-forward\">The Team's Vision Moving Forward</h2><p>In the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount of capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on development. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl Marketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking, and the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.</p><p>Other areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and community growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to these areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s precisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.</p><h3 id=\"more-focus-on-promoting-particl-s-awesome-products-and-growth\">More Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth</h3><p>Particl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its blockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the way they deserve. That’s all about to change!</p><p>As part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed from the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives aimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will establish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.</p><p>Additionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and is scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.</p><h2 id=\"supporting-and-expanding-the-team\">Supporting and Expanding the Team</h2><p>For the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal restructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized treasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we have identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have worked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding allows it.</p><p>This restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership, communications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic objectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members to be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Cryptoguard </strong>— Project management and communications</li><li><strong>Gerlof van Ek (crz) </strong>— Project and development management, Lead Designer, UI/UX, and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Imran </strong>— Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships</li><li><strong>Henk Swardt</strong> — Development management and coordinator</li><li><strong>Tecnovert </strong>— Lead core developer</li><li><strong>Arnold Bansemer </strong>— Lead desktop developer</li><li><strong>Kewde </strong>— Marketplace developer, OMP, and core</li><li><strong>Juha Kovanen </strong>— Marketplace developer</li><li><strong>Martin </strong>— UI &amp; UX integration and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Dros</strong> — Marketing, branding, and business research &amp; development</li><li><strong>Dasource</strong> — Technical research &amp; development</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents the current situation at the time of writing this blog post.</em></p><h3 id=\"team-expansion\">Team Expansion</h3><p>Funding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A greater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or contracting work with partners.</p><p>The expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically deployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.</p><p>Additionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its advisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.</p><h3 id=\"encouraging-and-stimulating-third-party-contributions\">Encouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions</h3><p>Although the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its operations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led governance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its level of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led initiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.</p><p>To that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools, documentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new ideas and projects.</p><h2 id=\"budgets-and-expenses\">Budgets and Expenses</h2><h3 id=\"infrastructure-expenses\"><strong>Infrastructure Expenses</strong></h3><p>“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to assure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited to, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain registrations, server maintenance, etc. </p><p>At the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a personal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are intended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off individual team members.</p><p><strong>Budgets</strong></p><p>“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that the team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not include team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.</p><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube, social media channels, and other mediums.</li><li><strong>Digital Ads</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e., Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.</li><li><strong>Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program</strong>, to grow the number of active vendors on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Event-based)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards</strong>, to help grow the project with new members/users and keep things interesting within the community.</li><li><strong>Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure by leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).</li><li><strong>Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in blockchain and technology-related media.</li><li><strong>Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.</li></ul><p><strong>Exchange Listings and Partnerships Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, </strong></strong></strong>to get Particl listed on quality exchanges and other third-party services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Partnership and team collaboration funds, </strong></strong></strong>to ease the establishment of partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Legal </strong></strong>costs<strong><strong>,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any required legal services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Corporate fees,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.</li></ul><p>Each month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the Particl team from the treasury model.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific budget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for example, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that precisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will remain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that specific budget to be used later on, as needed.</p><p>Although these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as we progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the number of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly reviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward. New budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team wants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation and to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.</p><h3 id=\"the-reserve-fund\"><strong>The Reserve Fund</strong></h3><p>Any extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries, expenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This includes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources of income for the team.</p><p>This Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against sudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is expected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing safety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-legal-entity-to-support-the-project\">A New Legal Entity to Support the Project</h2><p>To support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with any legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over the previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug, Switzerland.</p><ul><li>A <strong>more flexible</strong> legal entity operating within a well-respected and pro-blockchain jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Clear and progressive legal guidance</strong> for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.</li><li><strong>More financially efficient structure </strong>with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.</li></ul><p>This new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such as acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges), holding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury, emitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments (i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases (i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.</p><p>The Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed agreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set up the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new legal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal ends so that the project can move forward swiftly.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not responsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.</em></p><h1 id=\"let-s-summarize\"><strong>Let’s Summarize</strong></h1><p>There’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this proposal gets you.</p><ul><li>Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings overall quality improvement in all business areas.</li><li>Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.</li><li>Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development, marketing, legal, business, etc.</li><li>New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing on the products and their benefits.</li><li>Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors and customers.</li><li>Commitment to grow the user base and community.</li><li>Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges, third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.</li></ul><p>With the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the Particl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make it stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the Particl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of marketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.</p><hr><p>To read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9\">this link</a></strong>. </p><p>The proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so please leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or comment. As always, the schedule for this proposal’s voting period will be clearly announced a few days before it starts on all the usual Particl channels.</p><p>We hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the potential to significantly change things around by giving you, as a stakeholder of Particl, tremendous value. Let it be the trigger that lights the spark for the Particl ecosystem, giving it the needed exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce that it deserves.</p><p>Be a part and cast your vote on this pivotal proposal!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

This led to clear strategic objectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members to be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Cryptoguard </strong>— Project management and communications</li><li><strong>Gerlof van Ek (crz) </strong>— Project and development management, Lead Designer, UI/UX, and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Imran </strong>— Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships</li><li><strong>Henk Swardt</strong> — Development management and coordinator</li><li><strong>Tecnovert </strong>— Lead core developer</li><li><strong>Arnold Bansemer </strong>— Lead desktop developer</li><li><strong>Kewde </strong>— Marketplace developer, OMP, and core</li><li><strong>Juha Kovanen </strong>— Marketplace developer</li><li><strong>Martin </strong>— UI &#x26; UX integration and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Dros</strong> — Marketing, branding, and business research &#x26; development</li><li><strong>Dasource</strong> — Technical research &#x26; development</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents the current situation at the time of writing this blog post.</em></p><h3 id=\"team-expansion\">Team Expansion</h3><p>Funding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A greater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or contracting work with partners.</p><p>The expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically deployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.</p><p>Additionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its advisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.</p><h3 id=\"encouraging-and-stimulating-third-party-contributions\">Encouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions</h3><p>Although the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its operations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led governance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its level of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led initiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.</p><p>To that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools, documentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new ideas and projects.</p><h2 id=\"budgets-and-expenses\">Budgets and Expenses</h2><h3 id=\"infrastructure-expenses\"><strong>Infrastructure Expenses</strong></h3><p>“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to assure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited to, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain registrations, server maintenance, etc. </p><p>At the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a personal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are intended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off individual team members.</p><p><strong>Budgets</strong></p><p>“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that the team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not include team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.</p><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube, social media channels, and other mediums.</li><li><strong>Digital Ads</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e., Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.</li><li><strong>Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program</strong>, to grow the number of active vendors on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Event-based)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards</strong>, to help grow the project with new members/users and keep things interesting within the community.</li><li><strong>Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure by leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).</li><li><strong>Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in blockchain and technology-related media.</li><li><strong>Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.</li></ul><p><strong>Exchange Listings and Partnerships Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, </strong></strong></strong>to get Particl listed on quality exchanges and other third-party services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Partnership and team collaboration funds, </strong></strong></strong>to ease the establishment of partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Legal </strong></strong>costs<strong><strong>,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any required legal services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Corporate fees,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.</li></ul><p>Each month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the Particl team from the treasury model.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific budget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for example, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that precisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will remain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that specific budget to be used later on, as needed.</p><p>Although these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as we progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the number of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly reviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward. New budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team wants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation and to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.</p><h3 id=\"the-reserve-fund\"><strong>The Reserve Fund</strong></h3><p>Any extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries, expenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This includes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources of income for the team.</p><p>This Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against sudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is expected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing safety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-legal-entity-to-support-the-project\">A New Legal Entity to Support the Project</h2><p>To support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with any legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over the previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug, Switzerland.</p><ul><li>A <strong>more flexible</strong> legal entity operating within a well-respected and pro-blockchain jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Clear and progressive legal guidance</strong> for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.</li><li><strong>More financially efficient structure </strong>with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.</li></ul><p>This new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such as acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges), holding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury, emitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments (i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases (i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.</p><p>The Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed agreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set up the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new legal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal ends so that the project can move forward swiftly.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not responsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.</em></p><h1 id=\"let-s-summarize\"><strong>Let’s Summarize</strong></h1><p>There’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this proposal gets you.</p><ul><li>Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings overall quality improvement in all business areas.</li><li>Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.</li><li>Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development, marketing, legal, business, etc.</li><li>New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing on the products and their benefits.</li><li>Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors and customers.</li><li>Commitment to grow the user base and community.</li><li>Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges, third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.</li></ul><p>With the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the Particl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make it stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the Particl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of marketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.</p><hr><p>To read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9\">this link</a></strong>. </p><p>The proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so please leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or comment. As always, the schedule for this proposal’s voting period will be clearly announced a few days before it starts on all the usual Particl channels.</p><p>We hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the potential to significantly change things around by giving you, as a stakeholder of Particl, tremendous value.

This marks a significant moment in Particl history as the end\nresult is a new, more powerful self-funding mechanism for the ecosystem.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go through the timeline for the\ncoming weeks as the new decentralized treasury makes its way on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nThe Decentralized Treasury Proposal vote, the first-ever “protocol consensus\nchanging vote”, was an important milestone for Particl because it proposed\napplying critical changes to the protocol. Indeed, the proposal suggested\nraising the yearly PART coin emission rate from 2% to 8%, with half of the\nstaking rewards being automatically deposited into a treasury fund by the\nprotocol.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mind-blowing 96.6% approval rate (minimum required was 75%) and a \n70.6% participation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 10,080\nblocks, with 6,884 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 239 voting\nagainst it.\n\nThe participation rate for this voting round increased by ~7% compared to the\nprevious (and first) proposal that required a vote. This is an incredibly\nencouraging news in light of Particl’s transition into a community governed\nproject and shows just how active its stakeholders are.\n\nWhen Will it Go Live?\nNow that the results are official and that the decentralized treasury model has\nbeen approved, it can now be deployed on the Particl blockchain. For this to\nhappen requires a hardfork which relies on two deliverables.\n\nThe first one is, obviously, the integration of the decentralized treasury code\ninto the blockchain. The code for the changes has been completed and the build\nis now going through a thorough testing process on a side network (Particl clone\nnetwork).\n\nThe second deliverable is the integration of the output whitelist into the\nblockchain. This is tied to the output claim process which is currently ongoing.\nAs a reminder, the pre-fork process ends on June 21st, 2021. If you want your\ntemporarily disabled anon and blind outputs to be re-enabled in the coming\nhardfork, make sure you’ve read read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/] and submit your claim\nbefore that date, if needed.\n\nOnce the cutoff date of the claim period is reached, the final pre-fork output\nwhitelist will be bundled with the next Particl Core release and be submitted to\nexchanges so they can start the process of preparing for the coming hardfork. \n\nIf all goes well, Particl should be forking on the 12th of July, 2021. This is\ncurrently a target, the actual hardfork may happen a bit before or after,\ndepending on how fast exchanges and partners get ready for the fork. As always,\nwe will keep you updated with any news on the regard.\n\nThe Team Funding Proposal Goes Live Early This Week\nPutting in place a decentralized treasury model was only a first step in funding\nback the current Particl team. The second step is another proposal that will\nrequest capital from the treasury fund to fund the team and its operations. This\nproposal isn’t unlike what anyone else in the community can bring forward, but\nit’ll be Particl’s first-ever proposal to request resources from the treasury\nfund.\n\nThe proposal will detail the team’s strategy moving forward and will explain how\nit intends on utilizing the funds it is claiming. The proposal will be published\nand begin its discussion phase in the early moments of the week, on the CCS\nplatform. Make sure to be around if you want to provide comments and feedback on\nthe team proposal!\n\nNow’s the Best Time to Get Involved\nNow that the decentralized treasury model is about to go live on mainnet, you\ncan prepare your proposals and get them ready to be published. If, in the past,\nyou’ve had projects or ideas for Particl but couldn’t get the required capital\nto start them up, you now possess all you need to overcome that hurdle.\n\nBecause every submitted proposal first requires a discussion phase, and then a\nvoting phase of a minimum of one week, don’t hesitate to let the community about\nyour idea as soon as possible. This would ensure that the ecosystem and treasury\nfund get used right from the start and that no time is wasted before this new\naddition to the protocol starts benefiting the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is very excited about the new decentralized treasury\nmodel and can’t wait to see what you all come up with in terms of initiatives,\nprojects, businesses, and services. Particl now possesses the tools and\nresources to make anything happen; the sky is now the limit. It is now up to\neach and every one of us, the Particl community members, to make Particl a\nresounding success. So LFG!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.
