As always, we highly encourage you to participate in this vote and\nlet your voice be heard.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nDevelopment of the LLM-powered moderation tool for Particl Marketplace continues\nto progress. We're currently in the process of integrating it with the\nmarketplace to enable broadcasting of its voting messages via SMSG.\n\nAs we connect the tool to the marketplace, we're identifying and implementing\nadditional functionalities that are crucial for ensuring a stable and\nuser-friendly experience.\n\nThis integration phase is expected to continue for some time. We'll provide an\nupdate when we're ready to expand our testing group and involve more\nparticipants in the process.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAdaptor Signature Code Conversion ?\nWe've made further progress in converting the adaptor signature swaps to C++,\ncontinuing to develop and push code for this effort. Notably, we've updated the\ncustom secp256k1 library used in BasicSwap, which now has its own dedicated\nrepository on BasicSwap's GitHub.\n\nForked CoinCurve ✅\nWe've also forked and modified the coincurve library specifically for BasicSwap.\nThis customized version has been added to BasicSwap's GitHub organization,\nallowing for more control and better security of the protocol.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nIn line with our new strategy of smaller, more frequent updates, we've continued\nto refine various user interface elements. These changes will be merged into the \ndev branch within the next few days. The upcoming update will include the\nfollowing improvements:\n\n 1. User-selectable default coin display on the chart, with Bitcoin as the\n    default if no choice is made\n 2. Replacement of load time with last refresh time on the chart\n 3. Fixed rate column display\n 4. Implementation of a Tor-compatible API for prices/rates across all templates\n    when Tor is enabled by the user\n 5.

Thanks to everyone that has voted!\nAs we close the chapter on our fourth funding cycle, we're thrilled to announce\nour fifth funding request.

These developments and their\nrelevance for the project and its continuation will be expanded further down\nthis blog post.\n\nHere are some highlights of our achievements since the last funding cycle:\n\n * Particl added to MEXC (PART/USDT)\n   [https://particl.news/part-usdt-listed-on-mexc/]\n * Large number of updates to BasicSwap's codebase and GUI\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/master/]\n * Particl and BasicSwap join the PFS\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-joins-pfs/]\n * BasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows\n   [https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases/]\n * Talks at Monerokon (2023\n   [https://particl.news/monerokon-2023-presentation-kewde/] and 2024\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-at-monerokon-2024/])\n * Litecoin MWEB balances added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * BasicSwap on stage at the 2024 Litecoin Summit\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-to-present-at-litecoin-summit-2024/]\n * Decred added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/decred-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * Wownero added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/wownero-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\nOngoing Initiatives and Current Priorities\nEmbracing New Opportunities with BasicSwap\nWhile we recently encountered challenges in the development of Particl\nMarketplace, notably in terms of developer availability, these obstacles have\nled us to devote more time and effort towards BasicSwap. This strategic pivot\nhas allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a\nlevel of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and\necosystem revenue.\n\nWith this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving\nthe DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow\nBasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party\napplications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These\nefforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and\nutility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent\nPART price fluctuations.\n\nInnovative Funding Strategies\nThe recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've\nalso sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.\n\nIndeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize\nBasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community,\nwithout introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX\n(decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).\n\nOur immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for\nBasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART\ndonations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various\nstrategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning,\nexternal revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar\nmechanisms.\n\nIn other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its\ncontributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable\nenvironment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors,\nand the project as a whole.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the\nBasicSwap protocol free and open. Our monetization efforts are solely targeted\nat third-party integrations, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both\nthe community and our partners.\n\nDiversifying Funding Sources\nWe're also making strides in securing non-PART donations from communities that\nshare our vision and/or want to be integrated into BasicSwap.\n\nFor instance, one of our beloved community contributors, Ofrnxmr, has recently\nsubmitted a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/ofrnxmr_basicswap.html] to the Monero\ncommunity that got funded, and we've also received a donation\n[https://proposals.decred.org/record/0757fea] from the Decred community\nfollowing our successful integration of their coin into BasicSwap.\n\nThese initiatives are part of our broader strategy to achieve full\nself-sustainability and reduce — or, in the best of cases, completely eliminate\n— our reliance on the network treasury over time while improving our products\nfor the benefit of all.\n\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThese upcoming changes are the reason we are proposing a shorter team funding\ncycle this time around.\n\nIndeed, this proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] seeks a\nmonthly allocation of 35,250 PART from the Treasury Fund for a 6-month period.\nThis funding will support the Particl team and fuel our operations as we work\ntowards our goals of integration and self-sustainability.\n\nWe've opted for a 6-month funding request in order to provide stability for our\ncurrent projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while allowing\nflexibility for potential external funding opportunities and team expansion. \nThis timeframe also gives our community the chance to discuss and propose\nmodifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.\n\nFund Allocation\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to support the\necosystem and its dApps.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nAcknowledging Community Discussions on Treasury and Emission\nWe're aware of the ongoing community discussions regarding potential changes to\nthe treasury system, its parameters, and/or the blockchain's coin emission rate.\nThese conversations are crucial for the long-term sustainability and health of\nthe Particl ecosystem, and we strongly encourage their continuation.\n\nOur decision to request funding for a shorter 6-month period, as opposed to a\n12-month period as was the case with previous proposals, aligns directly with\nthese discussions. It provides the flexibility needed to pursue our new funding\nstrategy and adapt to any potential changes that may arise from community-driven\nproposals. We believe that this shorter claim period strikes a healthy balance\nbetween ensuring the continued, uninterrupted development of Particl and\nremaining responsive to the evolving needs and decisions of the community.\n\nHow to Vote\nWe encourage all stakeholders to participate in this crucial decision-making\nprocess. To cast your vote on proposal #24\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24], we recommend using the\npartyman cold staking application to register your vote on the blockchain.\n\nYou have three options:\n\n * Abstain (0)\n * Vote in favor (1)\n * Vote against (2)\n\nEvery vote counts! Higher participation ensures a broader consensus and a\nhealthier decision-making process for our entire community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running its latest version. To do so, \nrun git pull from inside your partyman folder, and then type the ./partyman\nupdate command from that same partyman folder.\nLooking Ahead: A Bright Future for Particl\nThe challenges we've faced recently have only strengthened our resolve and led\nus towards innovative solutions that will benefit our entire ecosystem.\n\nOur focus on BasicSwap integration, coupled with our efforts to diversify\nfunding and optimize our economic model, sets the stage for a resurgence of\nParticl and a renewed growth, much like the phoenix reborn from its ashes. As we\nwork on this new approach, we are confident in its potential to create\nself-sustaining ecosystem revenue that not only weathers market fluctuations,\nbut even thrives in the face of them.\n\nThat is why we invite you to join us in supporting this new funding request.\nYour participation in the voting process, your feedback, and your continued\nsupport are the driving forces behind Particl's success and the reason we keep\ndoing what we do.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support and commitment to the Particl project.

These developments and their relevance for the project and its continuation will be expanded further down this blog post.</p><p>Here are some highlights of our achievements since the last funding cycle:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/part-usdt-listed-on-mexc/\">Particl added to MEXC (PART/USDT)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/master/\">Large number of updates to BasicSwap's codebase and GUI</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-joins-pfs/\">Particl and BasicSwap join the PFS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases/\">BasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows</a></li><li>Talks at Monerokon (<a href=\"https://particl.news/monerokon-2023-presentation-kewde/\">2023</a> and<a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-at-monerokon-2024/\"> 2024</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/\">Litecoin MWEB balances added to BasicSwap</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-to-present-at-litecoin-summit-2024/\">BasicSwap on stage at the 2024 Litecoin Summit</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/decred-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/\">Decred added to BasicSwap</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/wownero-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/\">Wownero added to BasicSwap</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"ongoing-initiatives-and-current-priorities\"><strong>Ongoing Initiatives and Current Priorities</strong></h2><h3 id=\"embracing-new-opportunities-with-basicswap\"><strong>Embracing New Opportunities with BasicSwap</strong></h3><p>While we recently encountered challenges in the development of Particl Marketplace, notably in terms of developer availability, these obstacles have led us to devote more time and effort towards BasicSwap. This strategic pivot has allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a level of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and ecosystem revenue.</p><p>With this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving the DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow BasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party applications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These efforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and utility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent PART price fluctuations.</p><h3 id=\"innovative-funding-strategies\"><strong>Innovative Funding Strategies</strong></h3><p>The recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've also sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.</p><p>Indeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize BasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community, without introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX (decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).</p><p>Our immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for BasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART donations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various strategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning, external revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar mechanisms.</p><p>In other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its contributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable environment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors, and the project as a whole.</p><p><strong>It's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the BasicSwap protocol free and open.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nTeam Funding Proposal #5 (Vote Scheduled)Learn all the details about the\nParticl\nteam’s fifth funding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/]The voting period for our\nfifth community funding proposal is now scheduled. Indeed, the vote will begin\nthis coming Monday the 16th of September, from block 1,755,500 to block\n1,760,539 for a total of 5,040 blocks (approximately 1 week).\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it will require\na participation rate of at least 20% of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\nYou can review the proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-5.html] and follow the\nvoting results directly on the CCS platform, or consult the blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] for more information on\nhow to vote. As always, we highly encourage you to participate in this vote and\nlet your voice be heard.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe've continued work on the LLM-powered moderation tool for Particl Marketplace.\nNotably, we've had to rethink how listings are analyzed to ensure accurate\nresults, which we've now achieved (99%+ accuracy rate on test listings).\n\nWe will continue our testing and add in a few additional functions to cover edge\ncases and give more control to users before and after moderation. Then, we will\nbe ready to connect the script to the Particl network very shortly to ensure\nthat votes are broadcast to the marketplace.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAdaptor Signature Code Conversion ?\nWe've continued our back-end efforts have primarily focused on converting\nBasicSwap's Python code to C++, particularly modules related to adaptor\nsignatures.\n\nThis extensive and time-consuming process is crucial for making BasicSwap's\nbidirectional adaptor signature swaps compatible with portable versions of the\nDEX, such as mobile or web applications. You can refer to past weekly updates\nfor more information on this item here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-30-08-2024/#integration-layer-]\n.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nEarlier this week, we've pushed a pull request to BasicSwap which has now been\nmerged into the dev branch [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/]\n.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
