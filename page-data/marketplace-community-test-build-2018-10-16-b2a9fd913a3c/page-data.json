Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nLast week’s livestream was a special edition as we had the great pleasure to\nwelcome Gerlof van Ek, Particl’s Lead Designer, on the livestream as a guest.\n\nGerlof, more commonly known as Crz within the community, has gained valuable\nexperience working for international companies like Disney, Yves Rocher and\nother major design companies. He’s made a name for himself working and\nfreelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as \nShadowcash, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand\nin EOS (logo/branding), Nexus, CryptoFR [https://cryptofr.com/], BitcoinFR\n[https://bitcoin.fr/], Blocktix, a few exchanges and — of course —Particl, to\nname a few.\n\nGerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is\nin charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about\nGerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at \n2:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s]!\n\n(10:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s]) Could you please elaborate a bit\non the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t\naffected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?\nThe Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually\npretty critical\n[https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362]\n, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the\nlargest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently\nintroduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions,\nmeaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by\nit (for example, PIVX).\n\nAs for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is\nsimply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our\ncore development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this\nvulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential\nTransactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even\nbefore we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been\naffected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of\nour core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this\nclaim!.\n\n(13:48 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s]) Has the Particl UI been designed\nin such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?\nYes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes\nusing HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing two default themes\n, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl\nDesktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings\npage and set up their client to automatically change the theme at a specific\ntime of the day, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by\nthe community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or\nparticularly appreciated by the team.\n\n(15:44 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s]) Gerlof, it’s been said that\nyou’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS),\nso with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as\nopposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?\nParaphrased: Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main\nproject. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an\nidea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see\nhow far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we\nhave a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented\nindividuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and\nmotivating, which makes for a great work environment.\n\n(17:39 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s]) When you first started working\nwith Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer,\npart of the initial team?\nParaphrased: We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come\nand go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The\nvision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on\nit and we found new core members along the way which are now important\ncomponents of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now\nwith around 15 developers actively working on the project and it is amazing to\nsee!\n\nEverything is carefully planned, and we have daily meetings (sometimes more than\none per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a\nreally professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team\nmember we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the\nclock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the\nbackend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking\nParticl to the next level!\n\n(20:31 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s]) Will Particl Desktop’s page\neventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream\npotential?\nYes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl\nDesktop, but we do want to redesign/rebuild the Overview page to change it to a\nmore customizable one with the help of Particl widgets. That is because buyers\nand vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch\nParticl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales\ndata, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their\npurchasing history or favored items.\n\nSimilarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers\nif the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they\ncan immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users\nmight be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues\non ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl\nDesktop a true dashboard.\n\nBecause every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop\nto be very customizable. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is\nto have a complete installer that launches the first time you launch the client.\nThis installer will allow users to choose what decentralized applications they\nwant to be included in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set\ntheir client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user\nmight be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she\ncould disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in\nterms of resources. This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design\ntheir most optimal Particl Desktop setup.\n\n> It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy\ndevelopment phase and mostly a testing environment for now.\nThese are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything\nbeing built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and\neverything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to\ntest the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give\nus as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our #testing\n[https://discord.gg/m27aqEq] or #Open-Development [https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q] \nchannels or directly on the Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. It’s important to try\ndifferent approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and\nwhat doesn’t.\n\nParticl-Desktop — Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\nParticl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\n\n(24:59 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&feature=youtu.be&t=24m59s])\nIs Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?\nYes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example,\nJoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or\n3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a\nton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on\nParticl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese\nfor the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive\nt-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as\na good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d\nlike to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and\ngo-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past\nfew weeks!\n\nParticl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nFriday, October 5, 2018\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\n\nWe also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK\npointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note\nthat we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a\ndesire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage\nanyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact\nus, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve\nalso started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may\nbe hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we\nare still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great\nopportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be\nlooking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and\nbeyond.\n\n(44:03 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s]) Is there a limit to the number of\nlistings Particl Marketplace can support?\nNo! There is no upper limit to how many items Particl Marketplace can support!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Particl Core and Particl Desktop Versions Released\nParticl Core 0.17.0.1 and Desktop 1.3 are released\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nToday, Particl Core 0.17.0.1 was released on the heels of Bitcoin Core 0.17.0\nreleased yesterday.\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\n\nWe’ve released yesterday two major updates to our clients: Particl Desktop 1.3,\nand Particl Core 0.17.0.1. Both these updates are important, especially for\nParticl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in\nour usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days\nor weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a\nreleased it ahead of time.\n\nMost of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue\nrelated. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop\nv1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) automatically on\nrestart.\n\n> It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to\nimmediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with\nCore 0.17.0.1.\nNote: If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman\napp by navigating to its folder and executing the “git pull” command (without\nthe “ ”). You might also be requested to update your Core node by executing the\n“./partyman update” command (again, without the “ ”).\n\nNew Status Report Out\nParticl.io — StatusReport [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nwww.particl.io [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\n\nAs is now tradition, a new Status Report has been released last Friday just\nbefore we’ve started streaming. While not entirely different from previous\nreports, there are still a few interesting developments worth pointing out. For\none, the report shows that the escrow refactoring and enhancement process has\nbeen completed.\n\nA one week old preview of the current Particl’s testnet environmentThe report\nalso shows the team has started adding coin weight to the governance mechanism,\nmeaning that soon enough, it will work on a 1 coin = 1 vote basis. Implementing\nthe coin weight is a necessary feature of the governance mechanism to help\nfights spammers and only let users with an actual stake in the platform govern\nit. Coin weight also allows anyone, staker or not, to participate in the\ndemocratic process. For an interesting discussion regarding coin weight, visit\nthis forum thread of an archived discussion some community members and Lead\nParticl Marketplace Developer Ludx had last week on Discord/Telegram:\n\nDebate on Decentralized Voting Methodology Optimization\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nARCHIVED] General Discussion Channel (Discord/Telegram) (28–09–2018) Link:\nhttps://discord.gg/uvSpbQN Lollr: You can’t…\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nparticl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\n\nAdditionally, following some requests from the community on Telegram, we’ve\nbegun working on a Support & Help tab which will guide and help new users,\nespecially those not very experienced with crypto, in using Particl Desktop.\nThis is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy\nto use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started\nworking on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its\nlifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.\n\nAs usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code\nbeing refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience\nsmoother and more user-friendly. To get more details about the development\nprogress, please refer to our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nNoteworthy Github Activity\nAside from the Status Report, Github [http://github.com/particl] is always the\nbest place to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest developments.

Once again, we’ve had a very high participation rate with around 90\nsubmissions from 18 different users. As suggested by some community members,\nwe’ve decided to change the rules a little bit and have a jury composed of team\nmembers handpick the best slogans and put them up for vote. This should reduce\n“user fatigue” when confronted with too many options, and hopefully will result\nin a higher voting participation rate.\n\nThe contest ends next Monday, so if you had a slogan in mind and haven’t posted\nit yet, now is the time to do it!\n\nNew Video & Article from CryptoRamble\nThe Startling Secret Between Google and MasterCard — Crypto Ramble — Medium\n[https://medium.com/@cryptoramble/14eb3cfbc172]\nImagine that you are the creator of a useful tool that you think will help\nsociety.

That is because buyers and vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch Particl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>.

We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way.

We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

He’s made a name for himself working and freelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as <strong>Shadowcash</strong>, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand in <strong>EOS </strong>(logo/branding), <strong>Nexus</strong>, <a href=\"https://cryptofr.com/\"><strong>CryptoFR</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://bitcoin.fr/\"><strong>BitcoinFR</strong></a>, <strong>Blocktix</strong>, a few exchanges and — of course — <strong>Particl</strong>, to name a few.</p><p>Gerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is in charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about Gerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s\"><strong>2:10</strong></a>!</p><h3 id=\"-10-10-could-you-please-elaborate-a-bit-on-the-bitcoin-ddos-bug-that-was-disclosed-how-is-it-possible-particl-isn-t-affected-since-it-s-built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s\">10:10</a>) Could you please elaborate a bit on the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t affected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?</h3><p>The Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually pretty <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362\">critical</a>, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the largest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions, meaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by it (for example, PIVX).</p><p>As for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is simply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our core development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this vulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even before we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been affected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of our core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this claim!.</p><h3 id=\"-13-48-has-the-particl-ui-been-designed-in-such-a-way-that-will-make-it-easy-to-apply-skins-to-it\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s\">13:48</a>) Has the Particl UI been designed in such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?</h3><p>Yes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes using HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing <strong>two default themes</strong>, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl Desktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings page and set up their client to <strong>automatically change the theme at a specific time of the day</strong>, as chosen by the user itself.

We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>. It’s important to try different approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and what doesn’t.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Particl-Desktop — Issues</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><em>Particl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">github.com</a></p><h3 id=\"-24-59-is-particl-making-plans-to-have-more-sponsored-ambassadors-per-country\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=24m59s\">24:59</a>) Is Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?</h3><p>Yes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

This is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy to use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started working on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its lifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.</p><p>As usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code being refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience smoother and more user-friendly.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
