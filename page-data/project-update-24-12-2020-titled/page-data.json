New decentralized and anonymous\nmarketplace. Buy and sell anything online without leaving a digital footprint.\ncryptoguardParticl News Blog\n[https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-testnet/]Particl V3\nDevelopment Update\nThroughout December, a Particl V3-testnet build has been released to a limited\nnumber of community members. They have helped a lot testing the new V3 builds\nand identifying bugs and issues.\n\nAs a result, a few minor issues have been picked up, reported, and fixed. None\nof these issues were breaking bugs but rather improvements or quick to fix bugs.\nThe team has been busy preparing the release and making sure that it’s first\npublic testnet release would be as smooth as possible.\n\nTesting Guidelines\nWith Particl V3-testnet live and going, now’s the time to test it out as much as\npossible. The goal here is to try to break it or make it behave unexpectedly. In\nfact, this testing phase is all about finding any edge case that may lead to\nproblems once deployed on mainnet.\n\nTo properly report issues when testing Particl V3-testnet, click the bug icon at\nthe bottom left corner of Particl Desktop and create a Github issue describing,\nin detail, the problem you’ve encountered.\n\nAdditionally, you can join the Particl Community forum’s Marketplace Testing\ncategory [https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing] to discuss\nissues, ask questions, and find other Particl community members to test the\nmarketplace and make test orders.\n\nWork on Atomic Swap Continues\nParticl cryptographer Tecnovert has continued his work on atomic swaps so that\nthey can be integrated into Particl Desktop. This will go a long way in\nimproving PART's accessibility for all, including in the USA, and make the\nParticl platform more resilient to outside influence.\n\nOf course, atomic swaps between Particl and coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nMonero, Decred, and others are already possible, but they're generally\nunintuitive. That’s because atomic swaps need, at least for the moment, to be\nmanually executed. That means two swappers need to manually find each other,\nagree to what currencies they want to exchange, at what rate, and at what time.\nDuring the swap, they also need to manually exchange multiple “swap files”\neither through email, instant messaging, or other means of communication. In\nother words, the process of completing an atomic swap is currently tedious and\nfull of friction.\n\nTo fix those issues, Tecnovert has been working on a solution to fully automate\nall the steps and requirements to make an atomic swap. This solution, which can\nin many ways be likened to a DEX (decentralized exchange), is intended to be\nintegrated into Particl Desktop once it’s ready for deployment.\n\nThat’ll allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to easily buy and sell PART without\nhaving to quit the Particl Desktop client. This integration won’t require any\nthird-party, no account, no KYC, and won’t impose any limitation on the number\nof coins allowed to be traded.\n\nThere is currently no ETA on this item. It’s a pretty complex and bleeding-edge\nchallenge filled with unexpected setbacks and bumps. There is, after all, a\nreason why there are very few DEXes that are 100% decentralized. This is going\nto be a significant area of focus for Tecnovert going into 2021. More details\nwill be shared as we progress further.\n\nParticl.News is now on a Jamstack\nIt’s finally done, Particl.News is now officially hosted on GitHub Pages. The\neditor’s interface is delivered by Ghost (the blog ??), and everything is\nglued together by Gatsby! This new way of hosting the blog provides the project\nwith much more autonomy, a more tailored experience for the audience, easy to\nfind translations, complete control over the website, and zero unnecessary noise\nor third-party branding for you.\n\nIf you’re reading this blog post, then you’re already on the \"Jamstack\"!\n\nThe Particl Academy is About to Go Live\nThe internal testnet builds the team has had for the past few weeks have allowed\na lot of work to be put into the Particl Academy. It’s been completely updated\nwith all the recent information, tutorials, guides, and in-depth articles\nrequired to support the Particl V3 release.\n\nYou can expect the Particl Academy to drop somewhere during the current testing\nphase of Particl V3-testnet and before the mainnet release.\n\nNew CCS Proposal to Support the V3 Mainnet Release\nOn the 3rd of December, a new key proposal has been suggested on the CCS system.\nThis proposal aims at seeding the Particl Marketplace with thousands of listings\nto support the mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\nThis initiative aims to address the chicken and egg problem that each\nmarketplace faces when launching and provide a good base of listings that anyone\ncan buy. Who comes first? The sellers, or the buyers?\n\nThe proposal will also lead to a few Particl Marketplace improvements, such as\nadding a “wanted item” feature, the ability to edit/delete listings once\npublished on the marketplace, and potentially more. These features are not\nnecessarily intended for the mainnet Particl V3 release, but may very well be\npart of the next update after that (Particl Desktop 3.1).\n\nIt is expected that this proposal will move to the Funding Required phase in a\nmatter of days, so if you plan on supporting this initiative, keep your eyes\nopen for an update about it here on Particl.News or directly on CCS System.\n\nTo learn every detail about this proposal and see the community’s questions (and\ntheir corresponding answers), follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3].\n\nMarketplace Listing Seeding Proposal by cryptoguard · Pull Request #3 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryFund the development, maintenance, and management\nof\nan automated system to seed Particl Marketplace with thousands of products (and\ntheir reviews) and various storefronts. The initiative a...particlGitHub\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3]PART Unavailable on Flare\nWallet\nFlare Wallet has recently updated its back-end to use a different block explorer\n(BlockBook) other than Insight. However, due to a few concerns related to this\nback-end switch, the Particl team is currently evaluating whether it wants to\npursue a Flare Wallet listing or not.\n\nFor the moment, we recommend all Particl users to withdraw their PART coins from\nthe wallet while we evaluate the situation. We also recommend deactivating cold\nstaking completely for PART on Flare Wallet if it is already activated.\n\nThe Particl team is in touch with the Flare Wallet team and looking at the\nsituation. We will communicate more information about this at a later time.\n\n> Note: While it’s not possible to withdraw PART on the latest Flare Wallet\nversion, you can download previous builds (i.e., the desktop version of Flare\nWallet) on their website [https://flarewallet.io/] and then proceed with your\nwithdrawal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat to Expect From Particl Going Into 2021\nParticl V3 is not the end of anything, but rather, the beginning of an exciting\nphase for Particl. Although the Year 2020 has been heavily focused on\ndevelopment and less so on adoption, the Year 2021 will reverse that trend.\n\nWith Particl V3 going live on mainnet, that’ll provide a much more user-friendly\nand powerful decentralized commerce experience to users all across the world and\nwill make user adoption for Particl much easier.\n\nTo that end, the Particl team has been working on, researching, and\nexperimenting with a few concepts, features, and additions to the Particl\necosystem. These aim at fixing some of the issues that Particl still faces when\nit comes to adoption. Here are some additional areas of improvement the Particl\nteam will be focusing energy on in 2021.\n\n * Improve the accessibility of the PART coin and ease the process of buying and\n   selling it.\n * Improve the community marketplace moderation model to be more efficient,\n   scalable, and require less manual input from Particl users.\n * Increase the number of listed items on the Particl Marketplace and increase\n   the on-chain activity (CCS proposal already published).\n * Improve the RingCT anonymity set.\n * Improve the overall scalability of the Particl Marketplace and its underlying\n   protocols to support significantly higher levels of adoption.\n * Reduce the impact of the price volatility of funds while they are being held\n   in escrow.\n\nThese are “some” of the challenges the Particl team will address moving forward\ninto 2021. Although a few of these challenges are already being looked at, the\nfirst step is, of course, to release Particl V3 on mainnet and then assess the\nsituation. How it goes will help determine priorities for 2021 and the post-V3\nphase for the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are very excited to finally draw closer to the mainnet release of Particl V3\nand can’t wait to keep on expanding the Particl ecosystem and improving its\nadoption moving forward into 2021.\n\nDon’t forget to test out Particl V3-testnet all you can and report any bug or\nissue on Github and the Particl Community forum so that it can promptly be fixed\nbefore the “big release”. \n\nThe entire Particl team would like to thank you for your support and wishes you\na very merry Christmas and happy holidays!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

They have helped a lot testing the new V3 builds and identifying bugs and issues.</p><p>As a result, a few minor issues have been picked up, reported, and fixed. None of these issues were breaking bugs but rather improvements or quick to fix bugs. The team has been busy preparing the release and making sure that it’s first public testnet release would be as smooth as possible.</p><h3 id=\"testing-guidelines\"><a href=\"#Testing Guidelines\">Testing Guidelines</a></h3><p>With Particl V3-testnet live and going, now’s the time to test it out as much as possible. The goal here is to try to break it or make it behave unexpectedly. In fact, this testing phase is all about finding any edge case that may lead to problems once deployed on mainnet.</p><p>To properly report issues when testing Particl V3-testnet, click the <strong>bug icon</strong> at the bottom left corner of Particl Desktop and create a Github issue describing, in detail, the problem you’ve encountered.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2020/12/24-December-2020-09-11-00.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Additionally, you can join the <a href=\"https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing\">Particl Community forum’s Marketplace Testing category</a> to discuss issues, ask questions, and find other Particl community members to test the marketplace and make test orders.</p><h2 id=\"work-on-atomic-swap-continues\">Work on Atomic Swap Continues</h2><p>Particl cryptographer Tecnovert has continued his work on atomic swaps so that they can be integrated into Particl Desktop. This will go a long way in improving PART's accessibility for all, including in the USA, and make the Particl platform more resilient to outside influence.</p><p>Of course, atomic swaps between Particl and coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Decred, and others are already possible, but they're generally unintuitive. That’s because atomic swaps need, at least for the moment, to be manually executed. That means two swappers need to manually find each other, agree to what currencies they want to exchange, at what rate, and at what time. During the swap, they also need to manually exchange multiple “swap files” either through email, instant messaging, or other means of communication. In other words, the process of completing an atomic swap is currently tedious and full of friction.</p><p>To fix those issues, Tecnovert has been working on a solution to fully automate all the steps and requirements to make an atomic swap. This solution, which can in many ways be likened to a DEX (decentralized exchange), is intended to be integrated into Particl Desktop once it’s ready for deployment.</p><p>That’ll allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to easily buy and sell PART without having to quit the Particl Desktop client. This integration won’t require any third-party, no account, no KYC, and won’t impose any limitation on the number of coins allowed to be traded.<br><br><strong>There is currently no ETA on this item</strong>. It’s a pretty complex and bleeding-edge challenge filled with unexpected setbacks and bumps. There is, after all, a reason why there are very few DEXes that are 100% decentralized. This is going to be a significant area of focus for Tecnovert going into 2021. More details will be shared as we progress further.</p><h2 id=\"particl-news-is-now-on-a-jamstack\">Particl.News is now on a Jamstack</h2><p>It’s finally done, Particl.News is now officially hosted on GitHub Pages. The editor’s interface is delivered by <strong>Ghost</strong> (the blog ??), and everything is glued together by <strong>Gatsby</strong>! This new way of hosting the blog provides the project with much more autonomy, a more tailored experience for the audience, easy to find translations, complete control over the website, and zero unnecessary noise or third-party branding for you.</p><p>If you’re reading this blog post, then you’re already on the \"Jamstack\"!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-academy-is-about-to-go-live\">The Particl Academy is About to Go Live</h2><p>The internal testnet builds the team has had for the past few weeks have allowed a lot of work to be put into the Particl Academy. It’s been completely updated with all the recent information, tutorials, guides, and in-depth articles required to support the Particl V3 release.<br><br>You can expect the Particl Academy to drop somewhere during the current testing phase of Particl V3-testnet and before the mainnet release.</p><h2 id=\"new-ccs-proposal-to-support-the-v3-mainnet-release\">New CCS Proposal to Support the V3 Mainnet Release</h2><p>On the 3rd of December, a new key proposal has been suggested on the CCS system. This proposal aims at seeding the Particl Marketplace with thousands of listings to support the mainnet release of Particl V3.</p><p>This initiative aims to address the chicken and egg problem that each marketplace faces when launching and provide a good base of listings that anyone can buy. Who comes first? The sellers, or the buyers?<br><br>The proposal will also lead to a few Particl Marketplace improvements, such as adding a “wanted item” feature, the ability to edit/delete listings once published on the marketplace, and potentially more. These features are not necessarily intended for the mainnet Particl V3 release, but may very well be part of the next update after that (Particl Desktop 3.1).</p><p>It is expected that this proposal will move to the Funding Required phase in a matter of days, so if you plan on supporting this initiative, keep your eyes open for an update about it here on Particl.News or directly on CCS System.</p><p>To learn every detail about this proposal and see the community’s questions (and their corresponding answers), follow <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3\">this link</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Marketplace Listing Seeding Proposal by cryptoguard · Pull Request #3 · particl/ccs-proposals</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">SummaryFund the development, maintenance, and management of an automated system to seed Particl Marketplace with thousands of products (and their reviews) and various storefronts.

However, due to a few concerns related to this back-end switch, the Particl team is currently evaluating whether it wants to pursue a Flare Wallet listing or not.<br><br>For the moment, we recommend all Particl users to withdraw their PART coins from the wallet while we evaluate the situation. We also recommend deactivating cold staking completely for PART on Flare Wallet if it is already activated.</p><p>The Particl team is in touch with the Flare Wallet team and looking at the situation. We will communicate more information about this at a later time.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> While it’s not possible to withdraw PART on the latest Flare Wallet version, you can download previous builds (i.e., the desktop version of Flare Wallet) <strong><a href=\"https://flarewallet.io/\">on their website</a></strong> and then proceed with your withdrawal</em>.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"what-to-expect-from-particl-going-into-2021\">What to Expect From Particl Going Into 2021</h2><p>Particl V3 is not the end of anything, but rather, the beginning of an exciting phase for Particl. Although the Year 2020 has been heavily focused on development and less so on adoption, the Year 2021 will reverse that trend.</p><p>With Particl V3 going live on mainnet, that’ll provide a much more user-friendly and powerful decentralized commerce experience to users all across the world and will make user adoption for Particl much easier.<br><br>To that end, the Particl team has been working on, researching, and experimenting with a few concepts, features, and additions to the Particl ecosystem. These aim at fixing some of the issues that Particl still faces when it comes to adoption. Here are some additional areas of improvement the Particl team will be focusing energy on in 2021.</p><ul><li><strong>Improve the accessibility of the PART coin</strong> and ease the process of buying and selling it.</li><li><strong>Improve the community marketplace moderation model</strong> to be more efficient, scalable, and require less manual input from Particl users.</li><li><strong>Increase the number of listed items</strong> on the Particl Marketplace and <strong>increase the on-chain activity</strong> (CCS proposal already published).</li><li><strong>Improve the RingCT anonymity set</strong>.</li><li><strong>Improve the overall scalability</strong> of the Particl Marketplace and its underlying protocols to support significantly higher levels of adoption.</li><li><strong>Reduce the impact of the price volatility</strong> of funds while they are being held in escrow.</li></ul><p>These are “some” of the challenges the Particl team will address moving forward into 2021. Although a few of these challenges are already being looked at, the first step is, of course, to release Particl V3 on mainnet and then assess the situation. How it goes will help determine priorities for 2021 and the post-V3 phase for the project.</p><hr><p>We are very excited to finally draw closer to the mainnet release of Particl V3 and can’t wait to keep on expanding the Particl ecosystem and improving its adoption moving forward into 2021.</p><p>Don’t forget to test out Particl V3-testnet all you can and report any bug or issue on Github and the Particl Community forum so that it can promptly be fixed before the “big release”. <br><br>The entire Particl team would like to thank you for your support and wishes you a very merry Christmas and happy holidays!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Desde\nagosto de 2019, se han realizado cientos de ventas en todo el mundo en total\nanonimato, sin pagar ninguna comisión y sin ningún intermediario. ¡Y todo está a\npunto de mejorar aún más con la próxima actualización masiva de Particl!\n\nMáscarillas N95 a la venta, sin censura, en ParticlDesde mascarillas y equipos\nde supervivencia prohibidos en la mayoría de los mercados en línea durante la\npandemia de COVID-19 hasta videojuegos, tarjetas de regalo, monedas físicas de\nBitcoin Casascius, semillas de cáñamo o arte, ya se intercambian todo tipo de\nbienes en el mercado abierto de Particl. Pero imagínate que ahora pudieras\nconfigurar tu propio mercado o tienda virtual y compartirlo con quien quisieras.\n¿Qué venderías?\n\n¿Quieres crear un mercado especializado como autónomo? ¿Una tienda pública de\nproductos con cannabidiol? ¿Un mercado privado de comercio de metales preciosos?\n¿Un mercado privado para Casascius y otras monedas coleccionables? ¿Un lugar\npara intercambiar NFT sin riesgo de ser estafado? ¿Un mercado físico de\ncriptoarte para eliminar las tarifas de los intermediarios? ¿O tal vez solo\nquieres vender tu cuenta de Reddit llena de karma?\n\nEntonces, sin duda te encantará la próxima actualización de Particl: Particl\nDesktop 3.0 (Multi-Markets), porque permite todo esto y mucho, mucho más de lo\nque te imaginas.\n\n\nTe invito a seguir leyendo este artículo para conocer el desglose detallado de\ntodo lo que Particl Desktop 3.0 tendrá para ofrecerte. ¡Te encantará!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTabla de contenido \n * Su evolución desde su lanzamiento\n * Una aplicación de escritorio y mercado completamente nuevo\n * Reescritura de Particl Desktop\n * Adición de más funciones de las previstas inicialmente\n * Novedades de Particl Desktop 3.0\n * Particl Desktop [/p/8b368988-929a-4620-9c75-c2eb04be5ef2/particl-desktop]\n * Mejoras del mercado\n * Más por venir después del lanzamiento V3\n * Nuevas monedas que se agregarán\n * Sistema de mensajería cifrada\n * Particl Academy\n * Programa de incorporación y difusión de proveedores\n * Nuevo mecanismo de votación comunitaria\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n¿Qué es Particl Marketplace?\n\nParticl Marketplace es un mercado autónomo y descentralizado que permite a las\npersonas comprar y vender cualquier cosa en línea de forma segura y privada, sin\nnecesidad de la participación de terceros. Sin procesador de pagos, sin operador\nde mercado, sin banco, sin moderador, sin minero de datos, sin nada. Solo tú, la\npersona con la que hagas la transacción y un sistema de depósito en garantía de\ndos partes totalmente automatizado para evitar estafas\n\nOpen Marketplace de Particl en Particl Desktop V2Esta ausencia total de\nparticipación de terceros está cambiando por completo el comercio electrónico.\nEstá abriendo un montón de posibilidades que simplemente no existirían de otra\nmanera. Significa que ya no se requieren terceros, a menudo empresas con fines\nde lucro, para que dos personas realicen transacciones de manera segura en\nInternet. Particl Marketplace se ejecuta en una red p2p compuesta por nodos\nindependientes, por lo que no hay una única parte que cobre comisiones para\npagar los gastos y generar ingresos. Eso es algo extraordinario, especialmente\nsi se tiene en cuenta que los mercados en línea suelen cobrar entre el 5 % y\nhasta el 50 % por los servicios que ofrecen. Naturalmente, esos cargos se\nreflejan en el precio minorista de los productos y servicios vendidos en estos\nmercados.\n\nAdemás de todo eso, Particl también permite realizar este tipo de comercio\nelectrónico P2P de forma totalmente privada y anónima. De hecho, una combinación\nde protocolos que preservan la privacidad (como RingCT, CT, direcciones\nsecretas, Tor y encriptación sólida, entre otros) garantiza que no quede ningún\ntipo de huella digital cuando compres o vendas en línea.

Se ha mejorado significativamente en rendimiento y sensación, y\ntambién ha recibido un montón de nuevas funciones que ahora son de uso estándar\npara cualquier usuario de Particl en la actualidad.\n\nUna aplicación de escritorio y mercado completamente nuevo\nDesde el lanzamiento de los pagos de Bitcoin\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] en\nParticl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) el 25 de noviembre, el equipo ha estado\ntrabajando en la próxima y gran actualización de funciones (Particl Desktop\n2.4.0): Multi-Markets, o “ Infinite Markets” como la denominan algunos miembros\nde la comunidad.\n\n> Multi-Markets en pocas palabras\nLos mercados múltiples agregan la capacidad de crear y unirse a un número\ninfinito de mercados y tiendas virtuales creados por el usuario en la red\nParticl.

Este es un elemento importante de la \nhoja de ruta [http://particl.io/roadmap/] actual de Particl .\nInicialmente, con Particl Desktop 2.4.0 solo se tenía la intención de agregar la\ncapacidad de crear o unirse a un número infinito de mercados y tiendas\nvirtuales. Sin embargo, dado que esta nueva función requería cambiar una gran\nparte del código base, se convirtió en una gran oportunidad para dar un gran\nsalto adelante y, a consecuencia de ello, se volvió mucho mayor de lo previsto.\nEstos son los motivos…\n\nReescritura de Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop ya es una gran billetera de criptomonedas. Tiene un excelente\ndiseño, ofrece fantásticas sensaciones y hace todo lo que normalmente se\nnecesita de una billetera de criptomonedas (e incluso más). Una prueba de ello\nes que a menudo otros proyectos de código abierto la han bifurcado y adaptado \npara usarla como billetera de escritorio principal.\n\nPero también está empezando a mostrar su madurez. Ten en cuenta que Particl\nDesktop ya tiene casi tres años de antigüedad y el equipo ha adquirido mucha\nexperiencia y conocimiento en todo ese tiempo.\n\n\nPuede que haya sido ideal como billetera de criptomonedas simple y para las\nprimeras versiones del mercado, pero ha comenzado a mostrar sus limitaciones al\nprobarla con algunas de las características y funcionalidades más ambiciosas del\nmercado, como los mercados múltiples.\n\n\nPor ello, debido a que los mercados múltiples ya requerían mucho trabajo tanto\nen el código base como en la aplicación de escritorio, el equipo de Particl\ndecidió reescribir por completo ambos y llevarlos al siguiente nivel.\n\n\nGracias a ello, todos los componentes de Particl Desktop y la mayor parte del\ncódigo base del mercado han mejorado significativamente y ahora cuentan con el\nrespaldo de un código base nuevo y mucho más moderno.\n\nEs por eso que la próxima versión de Particl Desktop ahora se numerará como\nParticl Desktop 3.0.0 en lugar de 2.4.0.\n\nAdición de más funciones de las previstas inicialmente\nVista previa del panel de usuario de Marketplace que llegará a Particl\nDesktop 3.0Durante el proceso de reescritura completa, también se hizo evidente\nque algunas funciones claves del mercado inicialmente planificadas para más\nadelante podrían integrarse en el nuevo código base de inmediato. Aunque\nretrasaría un poco el lanzamiento de los mercados múltiples, en última instancia\nahorraría mucho tiempo en el futuro y simplificaría la integración del nuevo\ncódigo base en la aplicación de escritorio. Esto es lo que el equipo decidió\nhacer en un intento por ofrecer siempre la máxima calidad.\n\n\nPor esta razón, el lanzamiento de los mercados múltiples se ha retrasado un poco\nmás de lo esperado inicialmente; pero, lejos de ser un retraso, le ha dado al\nequipo la oportunidad de crear un producto alucinante que cambiará las reglas\ndel juego del comercio en línea descentralizado.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNovedades de Particl Desktop 3.0\nParticl Desktop V2 está a punto de retirarse y el nuevo chico del barrio, V3, va\na llegar con rapidez. Más que un simple cambio de número, esta versión cambia\ntodo el código interno de la aplicación de escritorio e introduce varias\nfunciones. Es, literalmente, la mayor actualización de Particl desde su\nlanzamiento en la red principal hace casi tres años.\n\nEstos son solo algunos de los aspectos sobre lo que uno puede esperar de Particl\nDesktop 3.0:\n\n Particl Desktop\n * Una aplicación de escritorio mucho más ligera, rápida, moderna y con mayor \n   capacidad de respuesta.\n * Un enfoque modular y separación de carteras, mercados y el motor de\n   intercambio en módulos diferentes e independientes.\n * Todos los módulos (incluido el mercado) están habilitados de forma\n   predeterminada desde el primer momento.\n * Interfaz de usuario y experiencia de uso enormemente mejoradas gracia a la\n   mayor intuitividad y facilidad de uso.\n * Una cantidad casi incontable de correcciones de errores , mejoras y ajustes\n   en la mayoría de los componentes de la billetera y el mercado (muchas gracias\n   a toda la comunidad de Particl por los valiosos comentarios ❤).\n * Una revisión completa de la interfaz del motor de intercambio en la\n   aplicación.\n * Una aplicación de escritorio compatible con SDK.\n\nMejoras del mercado\n * Adición de un nuevo panel de usuario del mercado con notificaciones avanzadas\n   y acceso rápido a las secciones principales de la cuenta.\n * Adición de múltiples mercados y la capacidad de crear una infinidad de\n   mercados y tiendas virtuales.\n * Adición del Market Browser y la capacidad de navegar y unirse a cualquier\n   mercado o tienda virtual creado por el usuario. También es posible promover\n   mercados en Market Browser.\n * Mejoras en la sección de preguntas y respuestas de los listados: acceso más\n   fácil y notificaciones más completas.\n * Adición de identidades y perfiles de usuarios.\n * Adición de categorías personalizadas que se pueden configurar por mercado o\n   tienda virtual.\n * Reducción enorme de las tarifas de publicación de anuncios: se reducirá en \n   más del 80% del costo actual. El costo de publicar un anuncio para un\n   producto en Particl será muy inferior a un centavo de dólar en PART\n * Mejora de la interacción entre Particl Desktop, el código base del mercado y\n   la red SMSG.\n\n> Nota: Debido a que las versiones V2 y V3 de Particl Desktop y el mercado son tan\nradicalmente diferentes, los anuncios no serán compatibles entre versiones. En\notras palabras, los anuncios publicados en V3 no aparecerán en V2, y viceversa.\nPor supuesto, siempre será posible volver a una versión V2 del mercado para\ncompletar cualquier pedido pendiente que aún tenga.\nMás por venir después del lanzamiento V3\nLa versión V3 de Particl marcará un paso significativo en la hoja de ruta\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/] de Particl, ya que tachará muchos de sus elementos.\nTambién servirá como desencadenante para que cobren vida muchas otras\niniciativas.\n\nAdición de nuevas monedas \nRevisión de la interfaz del motor de intercambio en la aplicación (Particl\nDesktop V3)Después de que Particl Desktop 3.0 entre en funcionamiento, se agregarán más\ncriptomonedas al motor de intercambio en la aplicación. Este será el mejor\nmomento para mostrarle al mundo lo que Particl ha estado haciendo en los últimos\nmeses y entrar con fuerza en diversas comunidades de criptomonedas.\n\nSistema de mensajería cifrada\nUn sistema de mensajería completamente distribuido, privado y cifrado,\nactualmente en desarrollo por parte de DeMarkets.io [https://demarkets.io/], te\npermitirá comunicarse con personas que estén en cualquier lugar del mundo. Ya\nsea que esa persona sea un comprador, un vendedor o simplemente un amigo, podrás\nintercambiar mensajes seguros a través de la red Particl. ¡Gracias a todos los\ndesarrolladores de DeMarkets.io [https://demarkets.io/] por el trabajo que están\nrealizando en este sistema de chat descentralizado! ❤.\n\nParticl Academy\nParticl Academy será el principal centro informativo de Particl, un manual de\nusuario interactivo. Contiene toda la información básica y las instrucciones\nnecesarias para utilizar Particl en toda su extensión. También está escrito con\nun lenguaje que cualquiera puede entender y está destinado a hacer que la\nincorporación de nuevos usuarios sea una tarea mucho más fácil\n\nPrograma de incorporación y difusión de proveedores\nEl Programa de Incorporación y Alcance de Proveedores ( VOP ) es un programa\ndiseñado para ayudar a facilitar el proceso de incorporación de nuevos\nvendedores y ayudarlos a dar sus primeros pasos en el mundo del comercio\nelectrónico descentralizado. También proporciona todas las herramientas\nnecesarias para que cualquier persona participe activamente para llegar y\nconseguir que nuevos vendedores se unan a Particl.\n\nPara ayudar y apoyar a los nuevos vendedores, el VOP proporcionará beneficios y\nventajas adicionales a los vendedores que opten por registrarse en el programa.\nEstos incluyen el financiamiento de tarifas de cotización , la promoción de\nmercados y tiendas virtuales, acceso a canales VIP , soporte personalizado, más \nexposición dentro de la comunidad de Particl y muchos más beneficios. También\nproporciona contenido de marketing e informativo a la comunidad para que\ncualquiera pueda salir y encontrar nuevos proveedores.\n\nNuevo mecanismo de votación comunitaria\nLa aplicación de staking en frío de Partyman se ha actualizado recientemente con\nalgunas nuevas capacidades de votación. Este sistema de votación es más privado\ny sólido en comparación con el sistema de propuestas de la aplicación. \nParticl.news [http://particl.news/] más detalles sobre cómo usar el sistema de\nvotación y cómo se utilizará para administrar el Fondo de la Comunidad.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAún quedan algunas semanas hasta la primera versión de Particl Desktop 3.0,\n¡pero la espera valdrá la pena!

Está abriendo un montón de posibilidades que simplemente no existirían de otra manera. Significa que<strong> ya no se requieren terceros, a menudo empresas con fines de lucro, para que dos personas realicen transacciones de manera segura en Internet</strong>. Particl Marketplace se ejecuta en una red p2p compuesta por nodos independientes, por lo que no hay una única parte que cobre comisiones para pagar los gastos y generar ingresos. Eso es algo extraordinario, especialmente si se tiene en cuenta que los mercados en línea suelen cobrar entre el 5 % y hasta el 50 % por los servicios que ofrecen. Naturalmente, esos cargos se reflejan en el precio minorista de los productos y servicios vendidos en estos mercados.</p><p>Además de todo eso, Particl también permite realizar este tipo de comercio electrónico P2P de<strong> forma totalmente privada y anónima.</strong> De hecho, una combinación de protocolos que preservan la privacidad (como <strong>RingCT, CT, direcciones secretas, Tor</strong> y<strong> encriptación sólida</strong>, entre otros) garantiza que no quede ningún tipo de huella digital cuando compres o vendas en línea.

Solo tú, la persona con la que hagas la transacción y un sistema de depósito en garantía de dos partes totalmente automatizado para evitar estafas</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2JXCn3pZQOMDM-qoXZSEWg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Open Marketplace de Particl en Particl Desktop V2</figcaption></figure><p>Esta ausencia total de participación de terceros está cambiando por completo el comercio electrónico. Está abriendo un montón de posibilidades que simplemente no existirían de otra manera. Significa que<strong> ya no se requieren terceros, a menudo empresas con fines de lucro, para que dos personas realicen transacciones de manera segura en Internet</strong>. Particl Marketplace se ejecuta en una red p2p compuesta por nodos independientes, por lo que no hay una única parte que cobre comisiones para pagar los gastos y generar ingresos. Eso es algo extraordinario, especialmente si se tiene en cuenta que los mercados en línea suelen cobrar entre el 5 % y hasta el 50 % por los servicios que ofrecen. Naturalmente, esos cargos se reflejan en el precio minorista de los productos y servicios vendidos en estos mercados.</p><p>Además de todo eso, Particl también permite realizar este tipo de comercio electrónico P2P de<strong> forma totalmente privada y anónima.</strong> De hecho, una combinación de protocolos que preservan la privacidad (como <strong>RingCT, CT, direcciones secretas, Tor</strong> y<strong> encriptación sólida</strong>, entre otros) garantiza que no quede ningún tipo de huella digital cuando compres o vendas en línea.

Estos lanzamientos han visto la adición de varias características importantes y una mejora significativa en todos los componentes.</p><p>Estas son algunas de las principales mejoras y características agregadas al mercado desde su lanzamiento:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Preguntas y respuestas sobre listados</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Importación de productos / inventario</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Pagos Bitcoin</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bots SMSG (servicios opcionales de terceros que se pueden habilitar)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Cancelación de oferta</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Reducción de la tarifa de listado</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Configuraciones</strong></a></li><li>Muchas mejoras de UI/UX</li><li>Muchas mejoras en la base de código del mercado</li><li>Muchas correcciones de errores</li></ul><p>No hay duda de que el mercado de Particl ha progresado sin problemas a lo largo de su <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>hoja de ruta</strong></a><strong> </strong>desde su lanzamiento en la red principal. Se ha mejorado significativamente en rendimiento y sensación, y también ha recibido un montón de nuevas funciones que ahora son de uso estándar para cualquier usuario de Particl en la actualidad.</p><h2 id=\"una-aplicaci-n-de-escritorio-y-mercado-completamente-nuevo\">Una aplicación de escritorio y mercado completamente nuevo</h2><p>Desde el <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\" rel=\"noopener\">lanzamiento de los <strong>pagos</strong> de <strong>Bitcoin</strong></a> en Particl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) el 25 de noviembre, el equipo ha estado trabajando en la próxima y gran actualización de funciones (Particl Desktop 2.4.0): <strong>Multi-Markets</strong>, o “ <strong>Infinite Markets</strong>” como la denominan algunos miembros de la comunidad.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Multi-Markets en pocas palabras</em></strong><br><em>Los mercados múltiples agregan la capacidad de </em><strong><em>crear y unirse a un número infinito de mercados y tiendas virtuales creados por el usuario</em></strong><em> en la red Particl. Básicamente, actualiza el mercado de Particl conectándolo a una amplia red de mercados creados por el usuario. Este es un elemento importante de la </em><a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>hoja de ruta</em></strong></a><em> actual de Particl .</em></blockquote><p>Inicialmente, con <strong>Particl Desktop 2.4.0</strong> solo se tenía la intención de agregar la capacidad de crear o unirse a un número infinito de mercados y tiendas virtuales. Sin embargo, dado que esta nueva función requería cambiar una gran parte del código base, se <strong>convirtió en una gran oportunidad para dar un gran salto adelante</strong> y, a consecuencia de ello, se volvió mucho mayor de lo previsto. Estos son los motivos…</p><h2 id=\"reescritura-de-particl-desktop\">Reescritura de Particl Desktop</h2><p>Particl Desktop ya es una gran billetera de criptomonedas. Tiene un excelente diseño, ofrece fantásticas sensaciones y hace todo lo que normalmente se necesita de una billetera de criptomonedas (e incluso más). Una prueba de ello es que a <strong>menudo otros proyectos de código abierto la han bifurcado y adaptado</strong> para usarla como billetera de escritorio principal.</p><p>Pero también está empezando a mostrar su madurez. Ten en cuenta que Particl Desktop ya tiene casi tres años de antigüedad y el equipo ha adquirido mucha experiencia y conocimiento en todo ese tiempo.</p><p><br>Puede que haya sido ideal como billetera de criptomonedas simple y para las primeras versiones del mercado, pero ha comenzado a mostrar sus limitaciones al probarla con algunas de las características y funcionalidades más ambiciosas del mercado, como los mercados múltiples.</p><p><br>Por ello, debido a que los mercados múltiples ya requerían mucho trabajo tanto en el código base como en la aplicación de escritorio, el equipo de Particl decidió reescribir por completo ambos y llevarlos al siguiente nivel.</p><p><br>Gracias a ello, todos los componentes de Particl Desktop y la mayor parte del código base del mercado han mejorado significativamente y ahora cuentan con el respaldo de un código base nuevo y mucho más moderno.</p><p>Es por eso que <strong>la próxima versión de Particl Desktop ahora se numerará como Particl Desktop 3.0.0 en lugar de 2.4.0.</strong></p><h2 id=\"adici-n-de-m-s-funciones-de-las-previstas-inicialmente\">Adición de más funciones de las previstas inicialmente</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9bL4_ptmCZyupKEKdUxxmA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Vista previa del panel de usuario de Marketplace que llegará a Particl Desktop 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>Durante el proceso de reescritura completa, también se hizo evidente que algunas funciones claves del mercado inicialmente planificadas para más adelante podrían integrarse en el nuevo código base de inmediato. Aunque retrasaría un poco el lanzamiento de los mercados múltiples, en última instancia ahorraría mucho tiempo en el futuro y simplificaría la integración del nuevo código base en la aplicación de escritorio. Esto es lo que el equipo decidió hacer en un intento por ofrecer siempre la máxima calidad.</p><p><br>Por esta razón, el lanzamiento de los mercados múltiples se ha retrasado un poco más de lo esperado inicialmente; pero, lejos de ser un retraso, le ha dado al equipo la oportunidad de crear un producto alucinante que cambiará las reglas del juego del comercio en línea descentralizado.</p><hr><h2 id=\"novedades-de-particl-desktop-3-0\">Novedades de Particl Desktop 3.0</h2><p>Particl Desktop V2 está a punto de retirarse y el nuevo chico del barrio, V3, va a llegar con rapidez. Más que un simple cambio de número, esta versión cambia todo el código interno de la aplicación de escritorio e introduce varias funciones. Es, literalmente, <strong>la mayor actualización de Particl desde su lanzamiento en la red principal</strong> hace casi tres años.</p><p>Estos son solo algunos de los aspectos sobre lo que uno puede esperar de Particl Desktop 3.0:</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop\"> Particl Desktop</h2><ul><li>Una aplicación de escritorio mucho<strong> más ligera, rápida, moderna</strong> y con mayor <strong>capacidad de respuesta</strong>.</li><li>Un enfoque <strong>modular</strong> y separación de carteras, mercados y el motor de intercambio en módulos diferentes e independientes.</li><li>Todos los módulos (incluido el <strong>mercado) están habilitados de forma predeterminada</strong> desde el primer momento.</li><li>Interfaz de usuario y experiencia de uso enormemente mejoradas gracia a la mayor <strong>intuitividad y facilidad de uso.</strong></li><li>Una cantidad casi incontable de <strong>correcciones de errores</strong> , <strong>mejoras</strong> y <strong>ajustes en la mayoría de los componentes</strong> de la billetera y el mercado (muchas gracias a toda la comunidad de Particl por los valiosos comentarios ❤).</li><li>Una <strong>revisión</strong> completa de la <strong>interfaz del motor de intercambio en la aplicación.</strong></li><li>Una aplicación de escritorio <strong>compatible con SDK.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=\"mejoras-del-mercado\">Mejoras del mercado</h2><ul><li>Adición de un <strong>nuevo panel de usuario del mercado</strong> con notificaciones avanzadas y acceso rápido a las secciones principales de la cuenta.</li><li>Adición de <strong>múltiples mercados</strong> y la capacidad de crear una infinidad de mercados y tiendas virtuales.</li><li>Adición del <strong>Market Browser</strong> y la capacidad de navegar y unirse a cualquier mercado o tienda virtual creado por el usuario.

El costo de publicar un anuncio para un producto en Particl será muy inferior a un centavo de dólar en PART</li><li>Mejora de la interacción entre Particl Desktop, el código base del mercado y la red SMSG.</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Nota:</em></strong><em> </em>Debido a que las versiones V2 y V3 de Particl Desktop y el mercado son tan radicalmente diferentes, los anuncios no serán compatibles entre versiones. En otras palabras, <strong>los anuncios publicados en V3 no aparecerán en V2, y viceversa</strong>. Por supuesto, siempre será posible volver a una versión V2 del mercado para completar cualquier pedido pendiente que aún tenga.</blockquote><h2 id=\"m-s-por-venir-despu-s-del-lanzamiento-v3\">Más por venir después del lanzamiento V3</h2><p>La versión V3 de Particl marcará un paso significativo en la <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>hoja</strong> <strong>de</strong> <strong>ruta</strong></a> de Particl, ya que tachará muchos de sus elementos.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
