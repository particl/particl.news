Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe have achieved considerable progress this week in regards to the remaining\nelements for the release of Particl Desktop 3.3 on mainnet, as mentioned in last\nweek's report. This includes fixing the create/restore flow for the default\nwallet and the CSV export feature. \n\nThe latter requires a slight amount of additional effort, however, the rest of\nthe development is largely finished and we are verifying the results while\nmaking minor corrections where applicable. \n\nWe anticipate a timely conclusion to the testnet round and will be prepared to\nlaunch Particl Desktop 3.3 on mainnet shortly afterwards.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ✅\nOnce Particl Desktop 3.3 is released on mainnet, we will begin working on the\nlisting seeding proposal, which has, since its initial proposal publication,\nundergone quite a shift in scope. This shift is now fully integrated into the\nproject's recently proposed vision and is outlined in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]Indeed, the listing seeding proposal\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3] has evolved into an\nindependent seller companion app for the marketplace, available to the public,\nand will be fully compatible with the new modular architecture of the ecosystem.\n\nThe app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle.\n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase. \n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly\nconvenient, accessible, and much easier to use.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

You can refer to the\nlist below as a reminder of what we're working on:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe are still working on the three outstanding items we mentioned in last week's\nprogress report. While there have yet to be completed items, we've been making\nsteady progress on our way to the testnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nFor context, here are the three outstanding items:\n\n 1. We still need to complete the integration of the new wallet-specific\n    settings. This ongoing item has been taking a bit longer than anticipated\n    due to more significant and forward-compatible changes to the settings\n    structure — making for a perfect segue into Particl's upcoming major\n    development cycle\n    [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n 2. Once that's done, we must re-add the new marketplace-specific code into\n    Particl Desktop. This is relatively trivial since most of the new code\n    relates to ensuring that the desktop client passes the correct startup\n    parameters to the market service. In other words, there is very little\n    interaction that the marketplace UI does with the rest of the system.\n 3. And then, a couple of tweaks and minor improvements/optimizations need to be\n    done, but they are negligible in terms of effort to sort out.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe're continuing our current final closed beta round of testing, and things have\nbeen going very well. \n\nHere's what we have to report this week:\n\n * We've had a decent number of testers helping us out, including members of\n   other coin projects, which has led to a few bug fixes and general\n   improvements.\n * Notably, we've identified a few issues with swaps done using non-Segwit\n   coins. These have now been promptly resolved!\n * We've also identified a few edge cases where issues could arise under\n   specific conditions. These issues are minor in nature, and none of them could\n   have led to a loss of funds or other similar critical consequences! Those are\n   typically quick fixes, and so we're fixing them as they come.\n * The v0.1.1 version of the BasicSwap GUI is nearly ready and should be live\n   for closed beta testing over the weekend or early next week. This GUI update\n   takes into account many comments, feedback, and user experience improvement\n   suggestions gathered from our testers. Thanks to all testers involved; your\n   help is invaluable!\n * We've dropped the TradingView chart to favour a locally built chart. While it\n   still uses third-party APIs to gather data about coin prices, the graph is\n   now much more stable and useful in the context of BasicSwap's native order\n   book system. Note that the API used is user-configurable and can be turned\n   off, if desired.\n * In the future, we also want to support the historical price chart with a \n   native depth chart based on offers placed on BasicSwap's own order books.\n   This is, however, not planned for the first phase of the public open beta.\n\nAs we continue testing and improving BasicSwap on a daily basis, we are rapidly\ngetting closer to the public launch of the open beta. \n\nWe will keep you up-to-date regarding the testing progress following the testing\nrelease of BasicSwap's v0.1.1 GUI and, on next week's progress report, should\nhave a much better idea of when BasicSwap will be able to jump into the open\nbeta phase!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

What's been\n   identified is currently being fixed and tested simultaneously.\n * We've received some good feedback and suggestions regarding the user\n   interface, which we're also adding while fixing the aforementioned bugs. We\n   will soon be pushing the v0.1.1 version of the GUI to the closed beta group.\n * Just as with its GUI, we've received good feedback and comments regarding the\n   BasicSwap codebase.

To that effect,\n   we've prepared easy-to-follow step-by-step guides on the entire process which\n   will be published on the Particl Academy in due time.

While the work continues, it is now progressing\nat a steady pace.\n\nNew \"Core\" section redirects to the newly-added Core-related settings (UI/UX is\na WIP)Now for a bit more information on the screenshot above.\n\n 1. Clicking on the \"Core\" button brings up the core configuration screen,\n    allowing the user to change various core-related settings. Things like\n    connection details (URL, whether to use the core cookie file for\n    authentication or provided RPC user/password, etc.), whether to start core\n    on PD startup or not, which network to connect to (mainnet, testnet, or\n    regtest), proxy details (i.e., Tor), etc. Those are generally saved in an\n    app-specific (wallet, market, etc.) JSON file, meaning that one can script\n    the download, configuration, and startup of Particl Desktop for specific\n    environments such as Whonix, for example.\n 2. In the screenshot, the core status message below the buttons shows that core\n    is connected. If core was not already connected, then the other buttons\n    would not be active. In other words, one cannot open the marketplace unless\n    core is actively running.\n 3. A new icon in the sidebar allows the user to navigate back to the welcome\n    screen from anywhere. Currently, it looks like a hamburger menu icon, but\n    we'll change it to a more comprehensible icon before the release.\n\nWhile the back-end changes are now complete, integrating them into the user\ninterface is our current main and final desktop-related deliverable before we\ncan go live with PD 3.3. Of course, as is always the case with larger releases,\nwe'll run a testnet round before the mainnet deployment.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

This is exactly what we did a few days ago, meaning Particl Core 24.0 is\nnow live on mainnet as a pre-release.\n\nAnd so, as soon as Bitcoin releases its 24.0 core update, we'll be to push\nParticl Core 24.0 as a full release. In the meantime, you can test it today on\nmainnet, and as always, let us know if you encounter any issues, bugs or have\nspecific feedback.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe are still wrapping up the very last pieces of the BasicSwap DEX GUI and will\ninitiate the final closed beta testing round this coming Tuesday!\n\nFollowing that important milestone, we'll also finish up BasicSwap's website and\npublish it a few days into the closed beta testing period, and definitely before\nBasicSwap's open beta release.\n\nBack-end Improvements ?\nCommits · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]As part of BasicSwap's\nongoing development process, we are still working on and pushing a variety of\nback-end improvements to the DEX protocol as we progress on its GUI. \n\nThis week, we've had the notable addition of a display for XMR viewkeys on the\nbid page. We've also seen a few other minor additions, which can be tracked by\nfollowing the DEX's repository on Github\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]. \n\nAdditionally, we've added simple notes that detail how private or secret swaps \ncan be done between two users without ever putting an offer on the books.\nObviously, this specific type of private order requires the two parties to find\neach other and agree on the trade terms on an external platform. What this\nfeature allows them to do is safely execute a trade without the need for them to\ntrust each other or use a middleman. Perfect for private OTC deals!\n\nBasicSwap DEX's Beta Status ?\nAlthough we will very soon release BasicSwap's open beta to the public, it's\nimportant to remember that it is still beta software. That means its development\nis still ongoing and there may be missing features or areas in need of\nimprovements. \n\nAs such, we're thrilled with the amount and level of community discussions,\nquestions, and general curiosity we've observed about BasicSwap lately. \n\nThis is precisely what we're looking for moving ahead with the open beta, and we\nwant to channel that energy to improve the platform more quickly. \n\nThat's why we will need as many people as possible to test the system, make\nswaps, and try to break it. Every single bit helps, and we're about to get\nstarted. As we begin the final phase of closed beta testing on Tuesday, stay\ntuned for the announcement of the open beta launch, which should follow shortly\nafter that.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've finally completed most of the back-end work required to separate Particl\nCore and Desktop. We'd like to implement a couple of extra minor items, such as\nlogging outputs from the front end to the Particl Desktop log file, but we will\nprioritize other more pressing deliverables first. In any case, we expect it to\nbe pretty simple and straightforward to implement when needed.\n\nFor now, we're in the process of re-evaluating some changes on the front end to\nintegrate these new changes neatly in a user-friendly way. Although that is not\nexpected to be a challenging task, it is relatively tedious as we now need to\nremove a wide variety of long-standing implementations to the GUI that we've\ncarried for several desktop versions. That means updating everything that\ndepends on those changes and then potentially updating any code that depends on\nthat functionality, and so on.\n\nSo, generally speaking, everything is continuing along and seeing steady\nprogress. We have reached a new milestone in the development process of Particl\nDesktop 3.3, and the remaining body of work mainly relates to the front end. The\nbiggest challenges are now safely behind us!\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nParticl Core 24.0 ?\nWe have split Particl Core into a new branch in preparation for the release of\nParticl Core 24.0. At this point, we are keeping on track with the Bitcoin\nupdates and are waiting for Bitcoin's release of Bitcoin 24.0 and its subsequent\ntesting before releasing it on our end. \n\nOnce Particl Core 24.0 is out on mainnet, we expect to diverge our primary\ncore-related focus into furthering the research and development for the\nlong-awaited SMSG 2.0 P2P network.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAs has been the case for the past few weeks, we've been wrapping up the GUI for\nBasicSwap. And although the final pieces have taken slightly longer than\nexpected to complete, we are an inch away from the finalization of the user\ninterface and, at the same time, the beginning of the open beta. \n\nMajor Particl Academy Update ?️\nWith the release of BasicSwap in mind, we've been overhauling the Particl\nAcademy to make place for documentation on the DEX. We've also refreshed its\ncontent and reorganized the information it contains.\n\nAll these changes make up for a relatively significant update, and we're happy\nto release the academy's new version next week!\n\nFollowing its release, we'll move on to refresh and improve several platforms\nand communications channels. These are as follows:\n\n * Standalone BasicSwap website\n * Refresh to Particl.io [https://particl.io]\n * Release of Particl's new all-in-one whitepaper\n\nThese updates will ensure that it remains as easy as possible to learn more\nabout BasicSwap and the Particl ecosystem within the context of the \nnewly-announced modular and open approach\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]. It also intends\nto embolden our mission and amplify the message we want to bring to the world.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nNew Particl Core Builds Released ✅\nNew Particl Core Releases AvailableNew Particl Core releases have been\ndeployed,\nfixing a rare staking bug that occurred over the past few days.Particl News\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/new-core-releases-staking-patch/]Earlier in\nthe week, we released an important update to Particl Core which fixed an odd bug\nregarding staking nodes falling out of sync with the rest of the network.\n\nIf you haven't updated your node(s) yet, we highly recommend updating your node\nas soon as possible to avoid any potential staking issues.\n\nNotably, as this issue occurred during the on-chain vote for the team's third\nfunding cycle, it lowered the participation rate slightly compared to what we\ntypically see. Regardless, the vote's participation rate ended well above its\nminimum requirement threshold, meaning that the issue didn't negatively impact\nthe voting process beyond that minor reduction in the participation rate.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nLast week, we mentioned that we had completed the important process of building\na standardized way to integrate certain Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies into\nBasicSwap, but still required to test that implementation.\n\nWe are happy to announce that we've successfully tested, on mainnet, this new\nintegration method, and we can report that everything went smoothly and as\nexpected. As such, we will now be able to use this standardized approach to add\nmore Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies at a much faster pace and let other coin\nteams work out listing integrations themselves.\n\nThird Team Funding Request Approved ?\nTeam Funding Request #3 ResultsThe third team funding request has been approved\nby Particl stakeholders. Thank you!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-request-3-results/]Yesterday, on the 25th of\nAugust, 2022, the vote for the team's third funding cycle concluded. We are\nhappy to announce that Particl stakeholders have officially approved the\nproposal with an impressive approval rate of 99.26%!\n\nWe want to thank everyone in the community for this vote of confidence and for\nparticipating in this democratic exercise. We are all very excited and proud to\nbe able to keep on working on Particl, expanding its ecosystem, and stimulating\nits adoption along with you all.\n\nFor a summary of the team's now-approved proposal and what we will be working on\nin the next year, please check out the original proposal blog post\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/] and the massive announcement\nregarding Particl's upcoming evolutionary leap forward\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client. \n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've been exploring the integration of certain coins on BasicSwap.\nWe're working on preparing example commits showing other projects which may want\nto integrate their coins onto BasicSwap how to do it themselves. However,\nBasicSwap's true cross-chain nature makes it impossible to have a\none-size-fits-all coin integration solution. Still, the example commits we're\nworking on will nonetheless be able to facilitate the integration process of a\ndecent number of coins.\n\nAdditionally, we've made significant progress on the DEX's GUI. We're currently\nworking through a few issues and adding improvements as we test it before\nreleasing publicly. But, just as a small end-of-week teaser, here is what the\ncurrent order book page looks like!\n\nListing Seeding Proposal Progress Update\nIt seems like we're long overdue for an update on the listing seeding proposal!\nAs it stands right now, we've got two short-term priorities related to Particl\nDesktop and the marketplace:\n\n * Completing the Particl Desktop 3.3 changes and releasing it\n * Deploying the listing seeding system\n\nAnd while we're currently primarily focused on the changes related to Particl\nDesktop 3.3, we've already begun working on the listing seeding proposal's\ndeliverable, notably by adding product codes in the last Particl Desktop update,\nwhich is a requirement for an improved, more complete vision we have for this\nproposal. But what is this \"improved vision\"?\n\nListing Seeding Proposal 2.0\nSince we've published the original listing seeding proposal, many things have\nchanged around the Particl project, especially considering last week's major\nannouncement of an evolutionary leap forward for the ecosystem\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nFor this reason, we've re-imagined what we intend to deliver for the proposal so\nthat it fits better with this new direction and have designed a more complete\nand open system that will drastically improve the life of Particl sellers — not\njust populate the marketplace with listings.\n\nAs opposed to building a relatively closed system for the exclusive purpose of\nseeding listings on the marketplace, we're now opting to build an open \"power\nseller\" standalone application intended to be released publicly.\n\nThis system will act as an external, advanced inventory and order management\ntool built for power Particl sellers. This will open up a ton of opportunities\nfor sellers by giving them access to more advanced capabilities. Notably, you\ncan expect most or all standard seller features to be available, such as the\nability to easily create, manage and publish listings as well as up escrow\nparameters, manage shipping, orders, and even chat conversations outside of\nParticl Desktop.\n\nBut, to complement these functionalities, sellers will be able to automate a lot\nof the typical seller-related processes such as automatically relisting\nmarketplace items, accepting and processing orders according to set preferences,\nand etc. When properly set up, it will allow sellers run their shops almost on\nauto-pilot and will dramatically reduce the time it requires to manage large\nseller accounts on Particl.\n\nAnother key function of this system will be in how it connects a seller\ninventory to a WooCommerce store (and, eventually, additional external platforms\nas we march through the upcoming development cycle). The main benefit here is\nthe ability to install and use a wide variety of WooCommerce plugins (i.e., an\nautomated dropshipping system like Dropified). This will grant sellers many more\noptions than ever before on Particl Marketplace, a taste of what's to be\npossible with Particl's new modular and open architecture.\n\n> Note: The system will be released with incremental feature updates.\nDeploying a Mobile Version of the Marketplace Quicker\nOne of the main reasons we've opted to change the design of the listing seeding\nproposal is to be able to release a buyer-focused mobile version of the\nmarketplace\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward#new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around] \nmuch quicker. That way, there is no requirement to wait for the full version of\nthe improved marketplace to be ready before we can start releasing new products.\n\nIndeed, because the first few versions of the upcoming mobile version of the\nmarketplace will be exclusively buyer-focused, sellers still need to be able to\npublish listings for buyers to buy. And since listings posted on the current\nversion of the marketplace won't show up on the new version (because the\ncodebases will be vastly different), there needs to be a way for sellers to\npublish listings while we build the full version of the marketplace.\n\nAnd that's where the listing seeding tool comes in handy. It will let sellers\nsell their products and services on the new version of the marketplace while we\nincrementally build the full version (on desktop and web). In other words, we'll\nuse this tool as an intermediary for sellers, allowing us to deploy the\nbuyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace more quickly and keep things\nmoving smoothly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

As it stands right now, we've got two short-term priorities related to Particl Desktop and the marketplace:</p><ul><li>Completing the Particl Desktop 3.3 changes and releasing it</li><li>Deploying the listing seeding system</li></ul><p>And while we're currently primarily focused on the changes related to Particl Desktop 3.3, we've already begun working on the listing seeding proposal's deliverable, notably by adding product codes in the last Particl Desktop update, which is a requirement for an improved, more complete vision we have for this proposal. But what is this \"improved vision\"?</p><h3 id=\"listing-seeding-proposal-2-0\">Listing Seeding Proposal 2.0</h3><p>Since we've published the original listing seeding proposal, many things have changed around the Particl project, especially considering <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">last week's major announcement of an evolutionary leap forward for the ecosystem</a>.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>we've re-imagined what we intend to deliver for the proposal</strong> so that it fits better with this new direction and have designed a more complete and open system that will drastically improve the life of Particl sellers — not just populate the marketplace with listings.</p><p>As opposed to building a relatively closed system for the exclusive purpose of seeding listings on the marketplace, we're now opting to build an open \"power seller\" standalone application intended to be released publicly.</p><p>This system will act as an external, advanced inventory and order management tool built for power Particl sellers. This will open up a ton of opportunities for sellers by giving them access to more advanced capabilities. Notably, you can expect most or all standard seller features to be available, such as the ability to easily create, manage and publish listings as well as up escrow parameters, manage shipping, orders, and even chat conversations outside of Particl Desktop.</p><p>But, to complement these functionalities, sellers will be able to automate a lot of the typical seller-related processes such as automatically relisting marketplace items, accepting and processing orders according to set preferences, and etc. When properly set up, it will allow sellers run their shops almost on auto-pilot and will dramatically reduce the time it requires to manage large seller accounts on Particl.</p><p>Another key function of this system will be in how it connects a seller inventory to a WooCommerce store (and, eventually, additional external platforms as we march through the upcoming development cycle). The main benefit here is the ability to install and use a wide variety of WooCommerce plugins (i.e., an automated dropshipping system like Dropified). This will grant sellers many more options than ever before on Particl Marketplace, a taste of what's to be possible with Particl's new modular and open architecture.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The system will be released with incremental feature updates.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"deploying-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-quicker\">Deploying a Mobile Version of the Marketplace Quicker</h3><p>One of the main reasons we've opted to change the design of the listing seeding proposal is to be able to release a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward#new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">buyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace</a> much quicker. That way, there is no requirement to wait for the full version of the improved marketplace to be ready before we can start releasing new products.</p><p>Indeed, because the first few versions of the upcoming mobile version of the marketplace will be exclusively buyer-focused, sellers still need to be able to publish listings for buyers to buy. And since listings posted on the current version of the marketplace won't show up on the new version (because the codebases will be vastly different), there needs to be a way for sellers to publish listings while we build the full version of the marketplace.</p><p>And that's where the listing seeding tool comes in handy. It will let sellers sell their products and services on the new version of the marketplace while we incrementally build the full version (on desktop and web). In other words, we'll use this tool as an intermediary for sellers, allowing us to deploy the buyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace more quickly and keep things moving smoothly.</p><hr><p>As always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and what it's working towards achieving.

The funds requested in this proposal are mostly intended to \nuninterruptedly fund the upcoming development cycle at the current pace and pay\nfor the various operation-related expenses.\n\nWith higher PART prices and liquidity, the extra PART will be allocated to fund\nvarious non-development-related initiatives such as marketing, communications,\ncommunity, and outreach efforts to promote the ecosystem and its dApps.\n\n * To read, discuss, or ask questions about the team's funding proposal, check\n   it out on Github [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/18].\n * For an extensive version of the proposal and a detailed breakdown of the\n   team's project through the previous funding cycle, take a look at this blog\n   post [https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/]. \n\n> Note: The voting round for this proposal will begin in the next few days.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nWe are making steady progress on the implementation of a more user-configurable\napproach to Particl Desktop. This week, we've run into one or two minor issues\nwith trying to support legacy functionality with the new settings configuration,\nbut it's generally progressing well without many problems yet.\n\nWe've linked, below this section and as a reminder, a blog post that details a\nlist of desired items to be included in Particl Desktop 3.3. While not all of\nthe mentioned items are expected to make it to the next version of Particl\nDesktop, it should give a better idea of where this is going.\n\nNotably, all the back-end work going into 3.3 is directly in line with Particl's\nupcoming major development cycle which will change the approach adopted to make\nthe entire ecosystem and its apps more accessible for developers, vendors, and\ncustomers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable with\nestablished 3rd party services, which vendors use in their day-to-day work, and\nmore welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3 ecosystem\nand community.\n\nIt is a major step forward for Particl, and we can't wait to get started with it\nafter the release of Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 — What to ExpectFind out what you can expect for the\nupcoming Particl Desktop 3.3. release.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/]Particl Core and\nBasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.
