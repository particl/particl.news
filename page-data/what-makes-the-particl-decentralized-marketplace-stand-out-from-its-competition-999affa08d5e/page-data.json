Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!\nUnlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be\nentirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this\ndifficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal\nprivacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata\nstripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the\nfuture, including Dandelion++ [https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging\n(using SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html] and\neventually more scalable and leading-edge DSNs\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \nsuch as Loopix\n[https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181]\n, IPFS [https://ipfs.io/], and etc), and much more. With all the data leaks and\nhacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \n(link to case for privacy)\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f].\n\nFurthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed\nvery effective blockchain tracking software that makes tracking public\ncryptocurrency transactions quite trivial\n[https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/]\n. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain\nthan say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with\nprivacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private\nblockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the “if you have nothing to hide,\nyou don’t really need privacy” kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people\nrealize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people.\nPlus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private\nenvironment, which they’ll want to use a solution that’s been designed with this\nas a prime aspect.\n\nBut why does that even matter?\nAs broken down in an earlier article of mine\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f],\nprivacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days\nwhere privacy was associated to people who had “things to hide”.\n\n> In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like \nEquifax\n[https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/a-year-after-the-equifax-data-breach-what-if-nothing-changes-02062051]\n, Facebook\n[http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/facebook-data-sharing-privacy-mobile-companies-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-5208703/]\n, Deloitte [http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/deloitte-hack/], Yahoo\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-dataprotection-yahoo/yahoos-eu-regulator-orders-privacy-changes-over-data-breach-idUSKCN1J32JX]\n, FedEx\n[https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3026819/thousands-of-fedex-customers-private-information-exposed-in-legacy-server-data-breach]\n, Uber [http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/uber-data-breach-security/], Under Armour\n[https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/another-fitness-app-exposes-users-data-a-11055] \nor even Pizza Hut\n[http://www.information-age.com/pizza-hut-suffers-data-breach-123469137/], the\npoor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts,\nthe public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within\nthe last couple of years.\nThe Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\nNowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust\nwith their personal data. In light of…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\n\nBreaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to\nfight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not\nrespect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just\nas bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask?\nBecause blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed,\ntransactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and\nfor vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want\neveryone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold,\ninformation that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized\nmarketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not\nwant anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.\n\nParticl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not\nneed to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything\nhappens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from\na public blockchain.\n\nBuilt as a 100% Decentralized & Trustless Solution\nAnother advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100%\ndecentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just\nas an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by\nSyscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be\nsomeone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead\nto bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact\nthat a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute.\nTalking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay,\nfor example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even\nwhen it shouldn’t.\n\nOn Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow\nis based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep\nboth parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace\nitself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or\ngroup of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with\neither vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the\noriginal, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the\nfirst place.\n\nFun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100%\ntrustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about\nit in some Bitcoin’s repository?\n\nMuch Better & Intuitive User Interface\nParticl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use\nin mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to\nunderstand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said\nof most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or\nbarebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.\n\nAdditionally, Particl plans on developing a web & mobile interface at some point\nin the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about\nit. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as\neasy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile\ninterface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the\nroadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the\nmainnet release of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace AlphaDownload Particl Marketplace Alpha here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\n\nMore recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel: \nhttps://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\n\nParticl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace\nIn the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a\nfull-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its\nroadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer\nout there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a\nsocial media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even\nthe addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will\ntruly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nThe goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms\nlike Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can\nall be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something\nakin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an\nAndroid OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop\nwallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the\nParticl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right\ninto it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp\nplatforms which are generally pretty barebone).\n\nOne of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only\ndecentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure\nsurrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce\ninfrastructure on which the coin can be spent).\n\nTop-Tier Development Team\nThe Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed\nranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (\nhttps://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked\n36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code\nquality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and\nmarketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl\nteam is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach\naccomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking\n(Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with\nSegwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin\ncodebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2\nwith 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin\nitself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though\nthey were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team\nthat is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security\nand decentralization.\n\nTo see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github\nvisualization videos included in this blog post: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\n\nMany Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist\nAs we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or\nalmost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community.\nSame thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and\netc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I\nthink we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors\nwon’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their\npotential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all\nco-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry.\nThis is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can\noffer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for\nsale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they\nare not alone in this space.\n\nWhat I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized\nmarketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand.\nAs such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the\nvalue of Particl considerably. That is because:\n\n * Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they\n   use another coin)\n * More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, \n   up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow as the\n   buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor\n   also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to\n   hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.\n * A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out\n   at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of\n   circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very\n   interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get\n   100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of\n   the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the\n   community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction.\n   Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus\n   anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming\n   staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of\n   holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.\n * Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency.\n   Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the\n   background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting\n   other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It\n   doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!\n\nThe four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized\nmarketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie,\neven a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally\nincrease the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is\none of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their\ncoins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).\n\nThird-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)\nAnother big thing about Particl too is that Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/], a\ndecentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on\nimplementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the\nmarketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and\nwill offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on\nParticl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user\n(read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user\nexperience is no different than eBay), customer support & product returns,\nshipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional\nmeans of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat\npayment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.\n\nMubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second\nmarketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview\nI conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with\nOpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have\nflaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with\nParticl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its\nplatform.\n\nInterview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface & Suite of Services Designed\nfor Particl…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\nA few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder\nof\nMubiz, a decentralized marketplace…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\n\nMubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will\nmake Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will\nbe making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn\nallowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their\ncompetitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and\ncheaper prices for the customer. Surely this should be an attractive solution\nfor most?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the end, I think the current bear market in the cryptocurrency scene will\nmake people realize the importance of intrinsic value. What if you take\nspeculation out of the equation? Does that make your favorite coin or token\nworthless or not?\n\nThis is what makes me so positive about Particl’s future. Its coin has great\neconomics, the technology is top of the line within the crypto industry, and the\nproject is securely funded for quite some time, with a second funding round that\nshould occur next year. Could Particl end up being in a perfect storm scenario\nat some point in the future?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not intended to be a source of\nadvice or credit analysis with respect to the material presented, and the\ninformation and/or documents contained in this blog post do not constitute\ninvestment advice.

Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace.</p><p>The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone).</p><p>One of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent).</p><h2 id=\"top-tier-development-team\">Top-Tier Development Team</h2><p>The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (<a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\"><strong>https://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa</strong></a>) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization.</p><p>To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\">https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfhGfmuLjo8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"many-decentralized-marketplaces-could-and-probably-will-co-exist\">Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist</h2><p>As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space.</p><p>What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because:</p><ul><li>Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin)</li><li>More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, <strong>up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow</strong> as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.</li><li>A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction. Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.</li><li>Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency. Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!</li></ul><p>The four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized marketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie, even a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally increase the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is one of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their coins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).</p><h2 id=\"third-party-building-on-the-particl-protocol-mubiz-\">Third-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)</h2><p>Another big thing about Particl too is that <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a>, a decentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on implementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the marketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and will offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on Particl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user (read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user experience is no different than eBay), customer support &amp; product returns, shipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional means of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat payment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.</p><p>Mubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second marketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview I conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with OpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have flaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with Particl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><strong>Interview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface &amp; Suite of Services Designed for Particl…</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><em>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder of Mubiz, a decentralized marketplace…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Mubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will make Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will be making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn allowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their competitors.

Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!</h2><p>Unlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be entirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this difficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal privacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata stripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the future, including <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78\">Dandelion++</a>), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging (using <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html\">SMSG</a> and eventually more scalable and leading-edge <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html\">DSNs</a> such as <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181\">Loopix</a>, <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a>, and etc), and much more. <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">With all the data leaks and hacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream</a> <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">(link to case for privacy)</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed very effective blockchain tracking software<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/\"> that makes tracking public cryptocurrency transactions quite trivial</a>. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain than say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with privacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private blockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the <em>“if</em> <em>you have nothing to hide, you don’t really need privacy”</em> kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people realize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people. Plus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private environment, which they’ll want to use a solution that’s been designed with this as a prime aspect.</p><h3 id=\"but-why-does-that-even-matter\">But why does that even matter?</h3><p>As broken down <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">in an earlier article of mine</a>, privacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days where privacy was associated to people who had “things to hide”.</p><blockquote><em>In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like </em><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/a-year-after-the-equifax-data-breach-what-if-nothing-changes-02062051\"><em>Equifax</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/facebook-data-sharing-privacy-mobile-companies-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-5208703/\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/deloitte-hack/\"><em>Deloitte</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-dataprotection-yahoo/yahoos-eu-regulator-orders-privacy-changes-over-data-breach-idUSKCN1J32JX\"><em>Yahoo</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3026819/thousands-of-fedex-customers-private-information-exposed-in-legacy-server-data-breach\"><em>FedEx</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/uber-data-breach-security/\"><em>Uber</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/another-fitness-app-exposes-users-data-a-11055\"><em>Under Armour</em></a><em> or even </em><a href=\"http://www.information-age.com/pizza-hut-suffers-data-breach-123469137/\"><em>Pizza Hut</em></a><em>, the poor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts, the public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within the last couple of years.</em></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\"><strong>The Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\"><em>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data. In light of…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Breaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to fight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not respect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just as bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask? Because blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed, transactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and for vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want everyone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold, information that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized marketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not want anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.</p><p>Particl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not need to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything happens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from a public blockchain.</p><h2 id=\"built-as-a-100-decentralized-trustless-solution\">Built as a 100% Decentralized &#x26; Trustless Solution</h2><p>Another advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100% decentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just as an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by Syscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be someone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead to bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact that a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute. Talking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay, for example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even when it shouldn’t.</p><p>On Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow is based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep both parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace itself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or group of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with either vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the original, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the first place.</p><p>Fun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100% trustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about it in some Bitcoin’s repository?</p><h2 id=\"much-better-intuitive-user-interface\">Much Better &#x26; Intuitive User Interface</h2><p>Particl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use in mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to understand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said of most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or barebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.</p><p>Additionally, Particl plans on developing a web &#x26; mobile interface at some point in the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about it.

In fact, today we’re officially releasing Particl Desktop 1.2.3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3], a major update\non the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop. A majority of its user\ninterface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly, and a lot\nof bug fixes and stability improvements were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!\n\nDownload link: https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\n\nWhat’s New Since Particl Desktop 1.1?\nWelcome to Particl DesktopWe believe that, for a product to be used by a large\nuser base, building an outstanding underlying technology is only part of the\nsolution. A product also needs to be easy to understand, intuitive to use and\naesthetically pleasing to the eye, otherwise, most people won’t bother. Thus,\nwith the goal of refining the user-friendliness and usability of Particl Desktop\nas we move forward, this new release introduces a lot of new features and user\ninterface improvement\n\nThe new interface tweaks and features introduced in this new release, which\ninclude pages, screens as well as modals redesign and additions, are designed to\ncreate a more intuitive and comprehensive way to use the Particl Desktop\nfeatures and decentralized applications such as the marketplace:\n\nNew:\n\n * New Particl Core modal\n * Time offset warning icon\n * Lots of new & better icons\n\nImproved:\n\n * Receive page\n * Address Book page\n * Make Payment screen\n * Block Syncing modal\n\nNon-UX Features:\n\n * Update to Particl Core 0.16.2.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0]\n * Nightly release scripts (Automatically generated builds posted in our \n   Discord\n   #testing channel [https://discord.gg/m27aqEq])\n * Filter outgoing HTTP request and attach authentication\n\nBug Fixes & Stability Improvement\n\n * Fixed the cold staking widget\n * Fixed the recovery phrase password field. Wallets created on Particl Desktop\n   1.1.0 could only be restored with an empty password field\n * Improved memory leaks\n * Encrypting Particl Desktop no longer requires a restart\n * More robust Windows builds & Particl Desktop termination\n * .desktop file is now created when installing Particl Desktop using .deb\n * The debug window now has better string decoding\n * No more missing 0 on fractional numbers\n * ModalsModule refactored\n * Transaction handling refactored\n * Fixed a ton of other small & insignificant bugs and stability issues\n\nCold staking widget is back!Particl Desktop 1.2.2* Showcase\nChristina, our social media coordinator, also put together a video on our\nYoutube channel showcasing Particl Desktop 1.2.2 and its new, improved look and\nfeel!\n\n*The difference between Desktop 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 are minimal, minor tweaks.\n\nPreparing for the Future\nReceive Funds PageOur first official decentralized application, Particl\nMarketplace, is going to be hosted and accessible directly from Particl Desktop.\nThis is precisely why this Particl Desktop 1.2.3 release\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3] is an important\none, as it sets the stage for a more intuitive approach to our product which\nwill affect how decentralized applications such as Particl Marketplace will look\nwithin the wallet. As mentioned earlier in this post, we strongly believe that a\nsolid underlying technology, that of which we are absolutely confident in, is\nonly one piece of the puzzle when it comes to creating a product used by\nmillions of people online. Usability and aesthetics also go a long way to\nattract a wider range of users, especially when building an online marketplace\nwhere looks and feel plays a very big part.\n\nParticl Marketplace\nParticl Marketplace Alpha (Testnet)As many of you already know, we are in the\nfinal stages of our mainnet RingCT implementation and have started implementing\nthe initial iteration of our decentralized governance\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1038503228789465088] for Particl\nMarketplace, which currently is at its Alpha stage of development and \nexclusively on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1134#issuecomment-419381012].\n\nFor this reason, we recommend keeping an eye on our Discord channel, especially\nthe #testing [https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23testing] channel, for new testnet\nbuilds of the market.

In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Such a platform would operate in a purely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid of single points of failure or centralized components.

You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and find a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing the seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern; if you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your physical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances and past transactions.</p><p>In most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended period, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to malicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential victim.

While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least avoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.</p><p>However, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment processors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and sellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve users' financial privacy and security.</p><h1 id=\"the-need-for-privacy-in-decommerce\">The Need for Privacy in DeCommerce</h1><p>Particl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure online marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT transactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation, RingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable capabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms have even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as exemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we have previously explored in depth <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Moreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences, tracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without consent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an unsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a scenario we’ve also previously discussed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>To safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl Marketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or distribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata. All marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such as buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through end-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">a peer-to-peer data and messaging platform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes</a>.</p><p>This privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data ownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks, exploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>While various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are still needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that eliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries within the eCommerce domain.</p><p>However, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for cryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising their safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious strangers.</p><p>As we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of cryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as eCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and well-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
