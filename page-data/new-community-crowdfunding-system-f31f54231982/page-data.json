That’s all thanks to the\nin-app Community Proposal system that uses SMSG, the same network used to\ndisplay listings and carry orders on the marketplace, and off-chain voting.\n\nHowever, this proposal system has fallen short of becoming a true and solid tool\nfor community governance for a few reasons. First off, it didn’t create any\npermanent voting record that could be used to prove the outcome, in retrospect,\nof any proposal. Additionally, it didn’t give the ability for people to raise\nfunds for community-led initiatives and projects. Finally, the in-app Community\nProposal system is currently only available in “market-enabled” wallets, meaning\nwallets that have the Particl Marketplace enabled. This has prevented everyone\nwithout funds on a market-enabled wallet to participate in any sort of\ngovernance.\n\nThese issues have led the community to instead push proposals, especially\nproposals that require funding, onto other platforms such as the Particl\ncommunity forum. While this gave more flexibility to proposers, this has also\ncreated its load of disadvantages such as spreading proposals all over into\ndifferent platforms.\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team has just released the CCS framework\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] which is now available on Particl’s official website.\n\n * https://ccs.particl.io/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the CCS Framework\nThe CCS proposal is a community crowdfunding and governance system to which a\nbrand new on-chain voting mechanism will be added at a later time. The framework\nis based on Monero’s and Zcoin’s own CCS framework (dubbed ZCS for Zcoin), which\nis open-source and available for all to use and fork on Github, and has been\ntweaked by Particl developers.\n\nThe CCS framework allows anyone to propose initiatives, projects and, later on,\nprotocol changes that benefit the Particl ecosystem and community. It increases\nthe decentralization of both the governance of the project and its funding,\nsomething the team has been wanting to do for a long time.\n\nThis new system uses Github and a user-friendly interface to make it as easy and\neffortless for anyone to let their voice be heard by the rest of the community.\n\n * Learn more about the CCS framework and its rules\n   [http://ccs.particl.io/what-is-ccs/]\n * Learn how to push your own proposal [http://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CCS Framework and its Many Benefits\nThe CCS framework allows anyone to push their own proposals to the network and\nget the community talking about it. Here are some of the main benefits it\nintroduces.\n\nMore Decentralization\nThe CCS further decentralizes the Particl ecosystem by giving more power than\never to its community. Anyone can now propose ideas, projects, or initiatives\nand get them independently funded.\n\nDo you have an idea, feature, or initiative that you want to see come alive?\nThen now you can take the lead and make it happen! You have full freedom over\nwhat you can do, even including hiring an independent developer or development\nfirm to complete the task at hand and get the bill funded by the community!\n\nMore Transparency and Accountability\nAs the CCS framework uses Github as its back-end and to host discussions, all\ncomments, feedback, and counter-proposals are permanently logged for all to see.\nThe same goes for any modification or edit to proposals, there is no possibility\nto stealth edit proposals to fool or mislead anyone. The CCS framework is as\ntransparent as it can be and forces proposers into full accountability to the\nParticl community.\n\nA Central Place to Find Proposals\nYou don’t need to be looking at multiple places at once now, the CCS framework\nis now the default place for all proposals to be logged and presented to the\ncommunity. This will make it easier for anyone to see what are the currently\nactive initiatives, proposals, and community votes (coming at a later point in\ntime).\n\nUser-Friendly Interface\nForget about the clunky process of dealing with proposals on a forum, a Discord\nchannel, or straight on Github. Yes, the CCS framework uses Github as its\nbackend, but it’s supported by a user-friendly and easy-to-use user interface\nthat anyone can understand.\n\nFunds Escrowed by the Particl Team\nDon’t worry about scammers or impersonators. All funds sent by the community to\nsupport any initiative are escrowed by the Particl team and only released upon\ncompletion of the task.\n\nPerhaps a proposal is rather complex or requires funds to be disbursed upfront?\nThen you can set up milestones so that the Particl team only disburses funds\nupon their completion. An upfront payment, in that case, would have to be the\nfirst milestone of a proposal. That should provide the community with confidence\nwhen sending funds to “strangers with an idea”.\n\n(Future Feature) On-Chain Voting for Protocol Changes\nSince Particl’s inception in July of 2017, the community has come up with a slew\nof proposals and ideas that would affect the Particl protocol. These can include\nstaking interest rates, the default number of RingCT mixins, and so on.\n\nTake note that, since protocol changes are pretty major modifications to the\necosystem, these will require a strong consensus within the community as well as\na general approval from relevant Particl team members. This is to ensure the\nsecurity of the network, the feasibility of proposed protocol changes, and to\nkeep in mind all potential drawbacks resulting from a specific change.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next\nNext on the CCS roadmap is, as probably evident by now, the new on-chain voting\nsystem which will allow the community to provably reach consensus whenever it\nneeds to be reached.\n\nThe new voting system will have many benefits over the current off-chain and\nin-app voting system of Particl Desktop (Community Proposals section in\nmarket-enabled wallets), all of which will be explained in detail in a future\nblog post.\n\nAs it stands right now, the new on-chain voting system still requires a few\ntweaks before it can be integrated into the CCS framework, but that should be\ndealt with rather quickly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Take Particl to the Next Level Together\nNow’s the time to get active and creative. The new CCS framework finally makes\navailable the tools necessary for the community to take the lead on various\ninitiatives and improve the ecosystem in an infinite number of ways.\n\nThe Particl team is committed to escrow the donated funds, support efforts by\nthe community, and encourage the growth of the network in a more independent way\nfor the foreseeable future. The team is very excited to see what the community\nwill come up with and happy to be able to increase the decentralization of the\nnetwork to higher levels.\n\nLet’s grow the Particl ecosystem all together and dramatically expand its\npotential.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Community-Crowdfunding-System/1-qyHIakjDEm-0DenBPOBelQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"proposing-and-supporting-community-initiatives-made-easy\">Proposing and Supporting Community Initiatives Made Easy</h3><p>Ever since the release of Particl Desktop 2.0 and the Particl Marketplace on mainnet, it has been possible for any Particl user to create and push proposals to the network and get them voted by the community.

It brings forward a\ncompletely new and improved desktop application, a refactored marketplace with\nbetter performance than ever, and a ton of long-awaited features such as, among\nmany, multi-markets.

Here is the latest progress\nreport which should give you a good overall idea.\n\n- All core functionalities of the marketplace have been completed and\nsuccessfully integrated into the improved Particl Desktop 3.0 client. “Core\nfunctionalities” refer to all basic marketplace interactions, including the\nselling and purchasing of products, the escrow system, the creation/sharing of\nmulti-markets, etc.\n\n- Particl Desktop 3.0 is now at feature parity level with Particl Desktop 2.0,\nmeaning that all desktop features that were present on Particl Desktop up to\nParticl Desktop 2.1 are now present in 3.0 and working fine. This excludes all\nthe new features introduced by 3.0, which are now integrated as well.\n\n- New features introduced by Particl V3 are completed, successfully integrated,\nand undergoing internal testing. These include multi-markets and storefronts,\nuser identities, modular approach to desktop client, coin control, anon listing\nfees, increased default ring signatures, anon order releasing, user market\ndashboard, UTXO splitter, etc, More information on some of these features in the\nfollowing section.\n\nParticl Desktop Market Overview (WIP)- Pre-existing features introduced in versions between Particl Desktop 2.0 and\nthe current latest version (2.3.5) are currently being reworked and improved to\nreach much smoother integrations and interaction with the new 3.0. These include \ncomments, as well as its new integration within the buy flow (you can now\ncommunicate with the other party, in the middle of an escrow transaction, to\nresolve any potential issue), bulk product import, and in-app swap module. These\nspecific items are not expected to take much longer before they are fully ready.\n\n- The first few internal builds of Particl V3 (there have been now over 5\niterations of it, each improving on previous issues and fixing bugs) have been \nvery stable, fast, and smooth considering the scope of the improvements and new\nfeatures added. There have, however, been a few issues notably with the speed\nand stability of Windows builds and this has been a major point of focus for the\nteam during the past few days. It has now identified the root of these issues\nand is in the process of promptly applying the required fixes.\n\n- Minor bugs and issues are being picked up and addressed all throughout this\ninternal testing phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Features and Functionalities Announcement\nParticl V3 introduces a bunch of new features and functionalities that\nsignificantly improves the user experience. Most of these additions are a direct\nresult of feedback and comments collected from you and all other Particl\ncommunity members. Because of this, the Particl team would like to thank you for\nhelping to identify areas of struggle and help improve DeCommerce.\n\nWe are excited to announce today a few features which have either been\nunannounced as of yet or have received minimal coverage. They are as follows.\n\nCoin Control Arrives in Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop’s Coin Control (WIP)This feature was teased on Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1300772895812091907] on the first of\nSeptember and can now finally be revealed. Coin Control is the ability to better\ncontrol the parameters of a transaction by selecting exactly which output(s) to\nuse when sending funds.\n\nAlthough this is an advanced feature, it is very useful to a lot of users which\nforced them to constantly switch between Particl Desktop and Particl-Qt wallets\njust to properly manage their outgoing transactions. Coin Control is now\navailable right from Particl Desktop!\n\nAnonymous Payment of Listing Fees (Anon Balances)\nIn Particl V2, listings used to be paid with public balances. Although that is\nstill the default behavior, you can now easily choose to pay for listing fees\nusing your anon balance. This significantly improves the level of privacy when\nadding listings to the marketplace, but it also has a few drawbacks such as\nlonger delays for listings to appear on the marketplace and can also negatively\nimpact the ability to list multiple listings at once.\n\nThat’s because anon “outputs” require 12 confirmations until they are confirmed\nby the network and can be used in new transactions. If you want to list multiple\nlistings at once and pay for the listing fees using your anon balance, you’ll at\nleast need as many anon outputs as the number of listings you’re trying to list\nat once.\n\nUTXO splitter\nTo facilitate the creation of many anon outputs, Particl V3 will also introduce\na UTXO splitter. This will allow you to set up your balances in such a way that\nyou’re going to be able to buy and sell multiple listings at once.\n\nWhen converting funds from a public balance to an anon balance, it used to\ncreate a single output. Outputs are kind of like internal balances that are used\nto execute transactions. A single address may have multiple outputs.\n\nWhenever you need to make an anon transaction, for example paying for an item,\nlisting a product on the marketplace, or just privately sending funds to\nsomeone, it locks the full amount contained in the output for 12 confirmations\n(~24 minutes). That’s true even if you don’t use the total number of coins\ncontained in that output. And then, if you had, for example, 2 outputs in a\nsingle address and tried to purchase 3 items, then you would have only been able\nto buy 2 items and then having to wait 24 minutes just to buy the third one. Of\ncourse, if the cost of an item can’t be covered by the full amount contained in\na single output, then 2 or more outputs may be used to cover the payment,\nleading to even more annoyances.\n\nWith Particl V3, you’ll now be able to specify how many outputs you want\nwhenever making an anon transaction (or balance conversion). The recommended\nbehavior is to create multiple outputs whenever converting balances, that way\nyou’ll ensure that you’re not going to encounter any bumps when making\nmarketplace payments for multiple listings at once.\n\nOrder Payments and Escrow Deposits Now Sent in Anon Balances\nIn Particl V2, order payments and escrow security deposits used to be sent into\nblind balances once transactions were completed. That is not the case anymore.\n\nWhen completing a transaction, you will receive your due funds into your anon\nbalance. This improves the level of privacy associated with using Particl\nMarketplace to even higher than before and makes it impossible for outside\nobservers to track the revenue of sellers and deposits of buyers.\n\nHigher Default Value for the Number of Ring Signatures\nNew Default Ring Signature Number (WIP)When making an anon transaction (RingCT),\nyour privacy is protected using what’s referred to as “ring signatures” (read\nthe Particl Explained — Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \narticle for more details). As a general rule of thumb, the more ring signatures\nused in a transaction, the greater your level of privacy gets. But much more\nthan that, a higher number of ring signatures also improves the level of privacy\nof other users’ anon transactions.\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.0, the number of default ring signatures used to\nanonymize RingCT transactions (anon) has been increased to 24. You, as well as\neveryone else making anonymous transactions, will now benefit from greater data\nsecurity!.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThoughts From Particl Desktop Developer Arnold Bansermer\nRecently, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer commented on a question from\nthe community about the perceived slow speed development for Particl V3. Because\nhis reply provides valuable insights into the process, we’ve decided to include\nit in this Development Update so that you can get an inside perspective on the\nmatter.\n\n“I want to mention that development is not occurring slowly. It’s progressing at\na much faster pace than what we were producing before. It may appear slow from\nthe outset perhaps due to visibility over the changes actually being made, so\nperhaps this is the actual concern.\n\nBut for perspective — in basically ten months, we’ve done major surgery on both\nParticl Desktop and the marketplace codebase which are both nearing release\nreadiness. That’s compared to Particl V2 (which includes Particl Desktop 2.0 to\nthe current version that’s live on mainnet) which took a lot longer than ten\nmonths to complete, taking in fact more than two years. That’s on top of doing\nthe R&D that’s necessary to actually make the newer stuff work.\n\nKeep in mind that this isn’t some copy/paste job, so when adding/updating\nfunctionalities we need to figure it out as well, and find a way to do it\nwithout sacrificing security/privacy which are core Particl values, or degrading\nthe UX significantly, etc.\n\nAll of that is coming from a team that’s a lot smaller than most dev products\nout there as it is, let alone in the crypto space. So while team members and\ndevelopers might seem quiet, it’s because we’re mostly focused on getting the\napplications finalized.”— Arnold Bansemer, Lead Particl Desktop Developer\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArriving at Destination\nThe Particl team would like to thank you for your continued support and patience \nin this long journey that has been the development of Particl V3. The team is\nfully aware of your expectations and is confident that V3’s release will be\nmeaningful not only for the Particl project but the entire world of DeCommerce.\nPlease bear with us as we thoroughly test the new builds and ensure the release\ngets the impact it deserves.\n\nThe team is very excited to finally be reaching the end of this phase of\ndevelopment and looks forward to embarking on new challenges following this\nlong-awaited release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Here is the latest progress report which should give you a good overall idea.</p><p>- <strong>All core functionalities of the marketplace have been completed and successfully integrated</strong> into the improved Particl Desktop 3.0 client. “Core functionalities” refer to all basic marketplace interactions, including the selling and purchasing of products, the escrow system, the creation/sharing of multi-markets, etc.</p><p>- Particl Desktop 3.0 is now at<strong> feature parity level with Particl Desktop 2.0</strong>, meaning that all desktop features that were present on Particl Desktop up to Particl Desktop 2.1 are now present in 3.0 and working fine. This excludes all the new features introduced by 3.0, which are now integrated as well.</p><p>- <strong>New features introduced by Particl V3 are completed, successfully integrated, and undergoing internal testing</strong>. These include multi-markets and storefronts, user identities, modular approach to desktop client, coin control, anon listing fees, increased default ring signatures, anon order releasing, user market dashboard, UTXO splitter, etc, More information on some of these features in the following section.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*LZhmJtAxgDgSLm6dY6QL6g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Desktop Market Overview (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>- Pre-existing features</strong> introduced in versions between Particl Desktop 2.0 and the current latest version (2.3.5) are <strong>currently being reworked and improved</strong> to reach much smoother integrations and interaction with the new 3.0. These include <strong>comments</strong>, as well as its <strong>new integration within the buy flow</strong> (you can now communicate with the other party, in the middle of an escrow transaction, to resolve any potential issue), <strong>bulk product import</strong>, and <strong>in-app swap module</strong>. These specific items are not expected to take much longer before they are fully ready.</p><p>- <strong>The first few internal builds of Particl V3</strong> (there have been now over 5 iterations of it, each improving on previous issues and fixing bugs) have been <strong>very stable</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and <strong>smooth</strong> considering the scope of the improvements and new features added. There have, however, been a <strong>few issues notably with the speed and stability of Windows builds</strong> and this has been a major point of focus for the team during the past few days. It has now identified the root of these issues and is <strong>in the process of promptly applying the required fixes</strong>.</p><p>- Minor bugs and issues are being picked up and addressed all throughout this internal testing phase.</p><hr><h2 id=\"new-features-and-functionalities-announcement\">New Features and Functionalities Announcement</h2><p>Particl V3 introduces a bunch of new features and functionalities that significantly improves the user experience. Most of these additions are a direct result of feedback and comments collected from you and all other Particl community members. Because of this, <strong>the Particl team would like to thank you</strong> for helping to identify areas of struggle and help improve DeCommerce.</p><p>We are excited to announce today a few features which have either been unannounced as of yet or have received minimal coverage. They are as follows.</p><h3 id=\"coin-control-arrives-in-particl-desktop\">Coin Control Arrives in Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*MOG23cQ1lv3sEYuCm_Rwug.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Desktop’s Coin Control (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1300772895812091907\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>This feature was teased on Twitter</strong></a> on the first of September and can now finally be revealed. Coin Control is the ability to better control the parameters of a transaction by selecting exactly which output(s) to use when sending funds.</p><p>Although this is an advanced feature, it is very useful to a lot of users which forced them to constantly switch between Particl Desktop and Particl-Qt wallets just to properly manage their outgoing transactions. <strong>Coin Control is now available right from Particl Desktop!</strong></p><h3 id=\"anonymous-payment-of-listing-fees-anon-balances-\">Anonymous Payment of Listing Fees (Anon Balances)</h3><p>In Particl V2, listings used to be paid with public balances. Although that is still the default behavior, <strong>you can now easily choose to pay for listing fees using your anon balance</strong>. This significantly improves the level of privacy when adding listings to the marketplace, but it also has a few drawbacks such as longer delays for listings to appear on the marketplace and can also negatively impact the ability to list multiple listings at once.</p><p>That’s because anon “outputs” require 12 confirmations until they are confirmed by the network and can be used in new transactions. If you want to list multiple listings at once and pay for the listing fees using your anon balance, you’ll at least need as many anon outputs as the number of listings you’re trying to list at once.</p><h3 id=\"utxo-splitter\">UTXO splitter</h3><p>To facilitate the creation of many anon outputs, Particl V3 will also introduce a UTXO splitter. This will allow you to set up your balances in such a way that you’re going to be able to buy and sell multiple listings at once.</p><p>When converting funds from a public balance to an anon balance, it used to create a single output. Outputs are kind of like internal balances that are used to execute transactions. A single address may have multiple outputs.</p><p>Whenever you need to make an anon transaction, for example paying for an item, listing a product on the marketplace, or just privately sending funds to someone, it locks the full amount contained in the output for 12 confirmations (~24 minutes). That’s true even if you don’t use the total number of coins contained in that output. And then, if you had, for example, 2 outputs in a single address and tried to purchase 3 items, then you would have only been able to buy 2 items and then having to wait 24 minutes just to buy the third one. Of course, if the cost of an item can’t be covered by the full amount contained in a single output, then 2 or more outputs may be used to cover the payment, leading to even more annoyances.</p><p>With Particl V3, <strong>you’ll now be able to specify how many outputs you want whenever making an anon transaction (or balance conversion)</strong>. The recommended behavior is to create multiple outputs whenever converting balances, that way you’ll ensure that you’re not going to encounter any bumps when making marketplace payments for multiple listings at once.</p><h3 id=\"order-payments-and-escrow-deposits-now-sent-in-anon-balances\">Order Payments and Escrow Deposits Now Sent in Anon Balances</h3><p>In Particl V2, order payments and escrow security deposits used to be sent into blind balances once transactions were completed.

It makes\nParticl faster, lighter, and as easy to use as ever. But more than just that, it\nalso adds a ton of new features and functionalities.\n\nIf you don’t know about Particl V3 yet, than make sure to click on the link\nbelow to get all currently available details.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\nAlthough the focus has almost exclusively been on the Particl V3 release for the\nlast few months, Particl Core has been ready for it for quite some time. This\nhas given Tecnovert, Core Developer, enough time to work on a little surprise\nwhich has been a very popular request from the community for a long time.\n\nThis surprise can now be revealed! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swaps Live on Mainnet\nOn the 15th of September 2020, the first ever Monero to Particl atomic swap was\nsuccessfully completed on mainnet.\n\n * Particl's xmrswap repository: https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/\n * Transaction: \n   https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30\n\nMonero — Particl Atomic Swap | Particl Insight\n[https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30]\nParticl Insight.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network.

There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
