The\nstaking rewards they collect are used to fund any initiative started by the\ncommunity, effectively bootstrapping the Particl economy and allowing it to be\nself-sufficient.\n\nThese pools are different from regular cold staking pools in that they can\ncharge up to 100% fees. This means stakers do not receive any staking reward\nfrom the number of coins being staked in this type of pool, but that doesn’t\nmean they don’t receive anything in return.\n\nFor more information about Community Contract Pools, please read our previous\narticle on the subject by clicking the box below.\n\nCommunity Contract Pools\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]\nIf you've been around the community for some time, then you probably know that\nthere have always been some discussions…\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGetting Started\nCommunity Contract Pools open up a lot of possibilities to expand and further\ndecentralize the Particl ecosystem. To get the ball rolling, we’re revealing\ntoday the first initiative to be supported by a Community Contract Pool: the \nAmbassador Initiative.\n\nWord of mouth is extremely important for any idea to gain traction in the\ncollective awareness of society. Our goal is to increase the velocity of the\nconversation surrounding the highly anticipated launch of the Particl\nMarketplace. And, this idea holds even more weight with us releasing a\nmarketplace because they are global platforms that purely rely on user activity\nto thrive.\n\nThis is the reason why we are announcing today the Particl Ambassador\nInitiative, an ambassador group actively advocating for Particl within their own\nsocial circles. This group will be directly supported by the first ever\nCommunity Contract Pool. The pool will award its ambassadors with staking\nrewards proportionally to their net performance in driving new people on the\nParticl platform.\n\nThe Ambassador Initiative\nThe Ambassador Initiative is a group of individuals that are passionate about\nParticl and are advocating for it within their own social circles. Ambassadors\nwill have the opportunity to earn lifetime shares of the pool’s staking revenue \nby participating in various campaigns.\n\nThe Mission\nThe ambassadors’ mission is simple: get people to sign-up and use the Particl\nplatform. It directly addresses the number one requirement for marketplaces to\ngain traction — getting as many active users as possible.\n\nIn order to achieve its mission, ambassadors will have the opportunity to\nparticipate in various campaigns, each of them having the objective to drive new\nusers to Particl.\n\nAmbassador Campaigns\nEvery once in a while, campaigns will become available for ambassadors. These\ncampaigns may be different from one to another, but their purpose will always be\nto fulfill the ambassadors’ mission of driving new users to Particl.\n\nCampaigns will usually last for several days or weeks and have their own rules\nand requirements. They will award participants with points which count as \nlifetime shares of the pool’s staking revenue.\n\nEarn PART\nBeing a Particl ambassador is, simply put, setting the income wheels in motion\nand keeping it in auto-pilot. In fact, when you participate in campaigns, you\nearn a percentage of the Community Contract Pool’s staking revenue by\naccumulating shares.\n\nYour performance within the lifespan of a campaign earns you more share. The\nnumber of shares you earn at the end of a challenge is directly proportional to\nyour performance.\n\nIt’s for Life!\n> Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed\nhim for a lifetime\nWhat’s really great about earning shares from the ambassador’s pool is that they\nare valid for a lifetime. This means that, once you earn a share, you keep it\nfor life. Imagine receiving a couple of staking rewards today, and still earn\nsome more a few years into the future!\n\nOn top of the lifetime characteristic of these shares, they are also cumulative.\nThat means you can get as many as you can, over as many campaigns as you want to\nparticipate in. There is no cap to how many shares you can accumulate as well as\nno penalty for not participating in campaigns. If there’s a campaign you can’t\nor don’t want to participate in, you won’t be penalized by losing shares you\nearned in the past.\n\nHow to Qualify as an Ambassador\nAnyone can qualify to become an ambassador. All you need to do is participate in\nambassador campaigns and start earning shares. Note that, most of the time,\nchallenges will require a minimum of scored points in order to qualify for the\npool’s reward program.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupport Particl Ambassadors Today\nSupporting Particl ambassadors with a portion of your staking rewards is like\nmaking a sort of “staking investment” in the Particl ecosystem. It incentivizes\nand encourages ambassadors to go out there, help grow Particl’s userbase, and be\nfairly compensated for their valuable time.\n\nGrowing the number of users directly adds value to the network because it\nincreases the number of buyers, sellers, available products on the marketplace,\nand etc. It also dramatically increases the velocity of the Particl economy by\nputting more staking rewards in circulation, an issue often cited when referring\nto Proof-of-Stake networks. Additionally, more users transacting on the network\nmeans stronger privacy for everyone.\n\nSimply put, the added value an effective and motivated core of ambassadors can\nprovide to the network far exceeds what it costs to get it properly funded, \nespecially when it’s getting funded with staking rewards. It also puts the\nnetwork’s inflation to good use by having it directly contribute to its own\nbenefit.\n\nEven though the first ambassador campaign will only be announced in a few days,\nyou can still start supporting Particl ambassadors today by connecting a wallet\nto the Community Contract Pool at https://stake.particl.community.\n\nFor a complete step-by-step tutorial on how to connect to a Community Contract\nPool, visit the Wiki page here: https://particl.wiki/communitycontractpools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Pool’s Parameters\n * Website: https://stake.particl.community\n * Operator: https://particl.community\n * Fee: 100%\n * Percentage of fees paid to ambassadors: 100%\n * Payout frequency: Every 2 weeks\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst Ambassador Campaign\nThe first ambassador campaign will be announced in a few days.

The Open Marketplace\nis a great example of this, but it’s far from being the only aspect contributing\nto the Particl global economy. Cold staking pools are also a key player in\nmaking sure anyone can contribute to the network and earn staking rewards in\nexchange for securing the network.\n\nWhile they’ve been mostly used by small holders to easily pool their funds\ntogether and earn staking rewards more frequently, the possibilities enabled by\nthe cold staking model extend much further than that. Indeed, Community Contract\nPools, a new form of cold staking pool, are at the core of an innovative\neconomic model through decentralized funding. We’d like to introduce this new\nconcept today.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * Decentralized & Crowd-Sourced Funding Model\n * What’s a Community Contract Pool?\n * How Do I Use Them?\n * What Can a Community Contract Pool Support?\n * Non-Binding Community Contracts\n * Start a Community Contract Pool of Your Own\n * First Community Contract Pool Goes Live This Week\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecentralized & Crowd-Sourced Funding Model\nIf you’ve been around the community for some time, then you probably know that\nthere have always been some discussions about setting up some sort of passive\nfunding mechanism through Particl Proof-of-Stake. After all, Proof-of-Stake\nprotocols are ripe for this — they reward you with coin rewards in exchange for\nsecuring the network. And, let’s be honest here, “securing the network” is a\npretty laidback process that doesn’t actually involve much manual labor. You\njust set up cold staking (or connect to a pool in less than 30 seconds\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUvwj-ejng4&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfwl7BxnruR84agicV1SyrYF&index=5]\n), sit back, and watch your staking rewards pouring in, nicely growing that\nwallet of yours.\n\nThis is precisely what makes passive funding so easy to do. Because donating\nstaking rewards doesn’t actually require you to spend a portion of your initial\ncapital, it makes altruism much easier, especially when it directly benefits the\nnetwork that’s making that form of passive income possible.\n\nOn top of that, airdrops, giveaways, and free stuff, in general, have proven to\nbe effective ways to grow crypto-based communities. With the huge numbers of\nblockchain projects, though, attracting users now requires projects to be as\ncreative as they possibly can. Luckily for Particl, it possesses some pretty\ncool and innovative tech that can be used, along with a bit of creativity, to\ncreate some pretty exciting incentive programs and passive donation concepts.\n\nSupporting a Community Contract Pool is not just a donation, it is an investment\nyou’re making into the Particl ecosystem to bootstrap its economy.\n\nWhat’s a Community Contract Pool?\nA “Community Contract Pool” is a brand new way to use cold staking pools for\nreasons other than just providing an easy and convenient cold staking option.\nThis type of pool charges users with a significant fee (usually 100%) fee and is\nmeant to be used in combination with multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]. Its\npurpose is to fund initiatives, as established by the pool’s operator, using\npassive community donations in the form of staking rewards.\n\nCommunity Contract Pools are the easiest way to passively crowdfund initiatives\nin order to spark growth within the Particl ecosystem. They are also a great\nshowcase of how the currently available Particl tech can foster a brand new, 2.0\ntype of global economy that simply wasn’t possible before.\n\nHow Do They Work?\nAs mentioned above, Community Contract Pools are meant to be used in combination\nwith multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]. The reason\nbehind this is pretty simple: stakers likely won’t be looking into giving ALL of\ntheir staking rewards away. No, instead, they’re more likely to be willing to\ndonate only a portion of them. That’s where multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076] come into\nplay.\n\nMulti-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076] allow you\nto easily manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance. It\nis as if you had many wallets opened up at the same time. The key here is that\neach of these wallets can be set up with a different cold staking key. This\nmeans you can have multiple wallets, on the same Particl Desktop instance, each\nstaking using different staking nodes or pools.\n\nAs an example, let’s say that you would like to fund a certain initiative with\n10% of your staking rewards. All you would need to do is pretty simple and it\ncan be done under a minute or two:\n\n * Create a new wallet on Particl Desktop\n * Send 10% of your coins to this new wallet\n * Visit the website of the Community Contract Pool you want to support\n * Locate and copy its public key\n * Connect your newly created wallet by entering the public key in the cold\n   staking widget\n * Zap your funds to start donating your staking rewards immediately\n\nOnce that’s all said and one, 10% of all your staking rewards will now be\nredirected towards the initiative proposed by the Community Contract Pool. Yes,\nyou would be making 10% less in staking revenues, but you’d be fueling up an\ninitiative that can contribute to adding more value to the Particl ecosystem\nthrough an active expansion plan that will benefit you and the entire community.\n\nWhat Can a Community Contract Pool Support?\nSo what are those special pools meant to support? Well, anything really. As its\nname implies, Community Contract Pools can be created by anyone in the\ncommunity, just like any other regular cold staking pool. The operator can\ndecide to support any initiative, cause, or project…and that’s where the \ncreativity side of things comes in handy.\n\nIn fact, Community Contract Pool can propose any initiative:\n\n * A marketing or social media campaign\n * A targeted airdrop to acquire new users\n * A Dapp development fund to support community developers\n * Donations to a privacy-focused organization (i.e. Tor Project, EFF, and etc)\n * An exchange listing\n * A vendor onboarding program\n * Pay for media services and articles\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Go WILD!\n\nNon-Binding Community Contracts\nWhen staking your funds in a Community Contract Pool, you are essentially\nentering a non-binding contract with the pool operator. In exchange for your\nstaking weight, the operator is meant to fulfill the mission for which the pool\nwas created.\n\nHow many funding a Community Contract Pool receives, however, is entirely up to\nthe stakers. Some initiatives might get more popular than others, and the\ndecentralized part of this system gives full freedom of choice to anyone looking\ninto actively contributing with their staking.\n\nStakers can easily and quickly exit the pool, without penalty, at any time and\nfor any reason. Community Contract Pools are, with this in mind, a non-binding\ncontract between the staker and the pool operator.\n\n> Note: Community Contract Pools should ideally be operated by experienced and\ntrusted community members. Pool operators should state the pool’s purpose,\nmission, and program. It should stick to it. As a counterparty, they should be\ntransparent and effective in managing the funds. Particl is not responsible for\nany misbehavior from any pool operated by the community. Stakers should always\ndo their due diligence before donating their staking rewards to a pool operator.\nStart a Community Contract Pool of Your Own\nStarting a Community Contract Pool is no different than starting a regular cold\nstaking pool. The only difference is the fee — up to 100% instead of the regular\n~2.5%. To get all the details on how to start your own cold staking pool, please\nrefer to this tutorial:\n\ntecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/vps_setup_example.txt]\nPooled coldstaking demo.

The\ngreater the number of Community Contract Pools, the more initiatives can get\nfunded!\n\nFirst Community Contract Pool Goes Live This Week\nTo kickstart this new concept, we will announce this week the first Community\nContract Pool and reveal its purpose. The campaign it supports will help drive\nattention to the project and its Open Marketplace by incentivizing influencers\nto promote and talk about it.

After all, Proof-of-Stake protocols are ripe for this — they reward you with coin rewards in exchange for securing the network. And, let’s be honest here, “securing the network” is a pretty laidback process that doesn’t actually involve much manual labor. You just set up cold staking (or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUvwj-ejng4&#x26;list=PLtbTcMbZZKfwl7BxnruR84agicV1SyrYF&#x26;index=5\"><strong>connect to a pool in less than 30 seconds</strong></a>), sit back, and watch your staking rewards pouring in, nicely growing that wallet of yours.</p><p>This is precisely what makes passive funding so easy to do. Because donating staking rewards doesn’t actually require you to spend a portion of your initial capital, it makes altruism much easier, especially when it directly benefits the network that’s making that form of passive income possible.</p><p>On top of that, airdrops, giveaways, and free stuff, in general, have proven to be effective ways to grow crypto-based communities. With the huge numbers of blockchain projects, though, attracting users now requires projects to be as creative as they possibly can. Luckily for Particl, it possesses some pretty cool and innovative tech that can be used, along with a bit of creativity, to create some pretty exciting incentive programs and passive donation concepts.</p><p><strong>Supporting a Community Contract Pool is not just a donation, it is an investment you’re making into the Particl ecosystem to bootstrap its economy.</strong></p><h2 id=\"what-s-a-community-contract-pool\">What’s a Community Contract Pool?</h2><p>A “Community Contract Pool” is a brand new way to use cold staking pools for reasons other than just providing an easy and convenient cold staking option. This type of pool charges users with a significant fee (usually 100%) fee and is meant to be used in combination with <a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\">multi-wallets</a>. Its purpose is to fund initiatives, as established by the pool’s operator, using passive community donations in the form of staking rewards.</p><p>Community Contract Pools are the easiest way to passively crowdfund initiatives in order to spark growth within the Particl ecosystem. They are also a great showcase of how the currently available Particl tech can foster a brand new, 2.0 type of global economy that simply wasn’t possible before.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-they-work\">How Do They Work?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Community Contract Pools are meant to be used in combination with <a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\">multi-wallets</a>. The reason behind this is pretty simple: stakers likely won’t be looking into giving ALL of their staking rewards away. No, instead, they’re more likely to be willing to donate only a portion of them. That’s where <a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\">multi-wallets</a> come into play.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><strong>Multi-wallets</strong></a><strong> allow you to easily manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance.</strong> It is as if you had many wallets opened up at the same time. The key here is that each of these wallets can be set up with a different cold staking key. This means you can have multiple wallets, on the same Particl Desktop instance, each staking using different staking nodes or pools.</p><p><strong>As an example, let’s say that you would like to fund a certain initiative with 10% of your staking rewards.</strong> All you would need to do is pretty simple and it can be done under a minute or two:</p><ul><li>Create a new wallet on Particl Desktop</li><li>Send 10% of your coins to this new wallet</li><li>Visit the website of the Community Contract Pool you want to support</li><li>Locate and copy its public key</li><li>Connect your newly created wallet by entering the public key in the cold staking widget</li><li>Zap your funds to start donating your staking rewards immediately</li></ul><p>Once that’s all said and one, 10% of all your staking rewards will now be redirected towards the initiative proposed by the Community Contract Pool. Yes, you would be making 10% less in staking revenues, but you’d be fueling up an initiative that can contribute to adding more value to the Particl ecosystem through an active expansion plan that will benefit you and the entire community.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-a-community-contract-pool-support\">What Can a Community Contract Pool Support?</h2><p>So what are those special pools meant to support? Well, <strong>anything</strong> really. As its name implies, Community Contract Pools can be created by anyone in the community, just like any other regular cold staking pool. The operator can decide to support any initiative, cause, or project…and that’s where the <em>creativity </em>side of things comes in handy.</p><p>In fact, Community Contract Pool can propose any initiative:</p><ul><li>A marketing or social media campaign</li><li>A targeted airdrop to acquire new users</li><li>A Dapp development fund to support community developers</li><li>Donations to a privacy-focused organization (i.e. Tor Project, EFF, and etc)</li><li>An exchange listing</li><li>A vendor onboarding program</li><li>Pay for media services and articles</li></ul><p><strong>The possibilities are endless. Go WILD!</strong></p><h2 id=\"non-binding-community-contracts\">Non-Binding Community Contracts</h2><p>When staking your funds in a Community Contract Pool, you are essentially entering a non-binding contract with the pool operator. In exchange for your staking weight, the operator is meant to fulfill the mission for which the pool was created.</p><p>How many funding a Community Contract Pool receives, however, is entirely up to the stakers. Some initiatives might get more popular than others, and the decentralized part of this system gives full freedom of choice to anyone looking into actively contributing with their staking.</p><p>Stakers can easily and quickly exit the pool, without penalty, at any time and for any reason. Community Contract Pools are, with this in mind, a non-binding contract between the staker and the pool operator.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>Community Contract Pools should ideally be operated by experienced and trusted community members. Pool operators should state the pool’s purpose, mission, and program. It should stick to it. As a counterparty, they should be transparent and effective in managing the funds.

Devices, apps,\nnetworks, and retailers are becoming increasingly talkative with each other, and\nit just so happens that the topic of conversation is, well, you.\n\nSwimming in an Ocean of Data\nIf you look closely, there’s a common thread between your phone and that\nseemingly innocuous browser ad plugging Nike shoes the day after you visited a\nNike shop. Your live data runs straight into the clutches of the data-harvesting\napps populating your devices, manifesting itself later on in the form of eerily\naccurate ads and suggestions.\n\nAs life becomes increasingly digital, you’re leaving a virtual trail with each\nmove. Every moment of every day, your devices log your actions, save the data,\nand sell it to the highest bidder. Your hour-long stop at Whole Foods grocery\nstore after work, the route you took to get there, the Spotify playlist you\nlistened to on the drive, the Amazon Prime purchase you made — none of it goes\nunrecorded, and all of it is sold by the very apps, networks, and devices you\ntrust.\n\nYour data forms countless streams that funnel into an invisible ocean of data.\nThat is true for anyone who regularly accesses the internet, uses apps, or owns\na smartphone. While some of it can’t be readily interpreted just yet (such as\nyour Instagram photos and voice messages), the technology for mining it is\nrapidly maturing.\n\nIt’s All in the Fine Print — Or, Is It?\nThe obvious question to ask is — who wants this data, and why?\n\nFor retailers, governments, and social networks, getting to know you is a\nlucrative business. Your raw personal data translates directly into money and \npower for internet giants like Facebook, who benefit immensely from doing\nsketchy things like recording your conversations and phone calls.\n\nAs the world’s leading data broker, Acxiom buys data wholesale and unloads it to\nother businesses for consumer targeting. After clearing over $1 billion in sales\nlast year, Acxiom sold their company for $2 billion. All of that profit is built\nfrom data you generated — your personal experience, whether on the web or\notherwise, is no longer yours because you don’t own it.\n\nSome argue that because of the fine print in the terms and conditions when you\ncreate app accounts, all of this is known. However, did you agree to the box\nthat said Facebook would sell your data to a company using it to interfere in\nelections throughout the world? Of course not, because that box wasn’t an\noption. That didn’t stop Facebook from selling the personal data of 87 million\nusers to Cambridge Analytica, a company directly implicated in using it to\ninfluence the outcome of the 2016 US election.\n\nCan You Really Control What Happens of Your Data?\nAmazon, the world’s largest online retailer, allows third-party sellers on its\nplatform. Over 30% of those sellers are China-based and use payment platforms\nsuch as LianLian. Payment processors have direct access to a seller’s account\nand can, therefore, collect buyer data as well. With a massive share of the\nworld’s largest retail network, Chinese payment processors have every incentive\nto harvest and sell your data for additional revenue.\n\nQuora, Uber, Equifax, eBay, Google, T-Mobile, Microsoft, and countless other\napps, services, and platforms used worldwide are all cashing in on the big data\nbusiness that is worth, all told, an estimated $250 billion a year.\n\nWhen your data is sold, it isn’t tagged or tracked. It flows down the bottomless\nrabbit holes of the internet, and where it ends up is anyone’s guess. One\ncompany may use your data for micro-targeting while another uses it to fuel its\npredictive analytics.\n\nThe moment you do anything that can be digitally represented, that action is\ntransmuted into data and immediately trades hands.\n\n> …your personal experience, whether on the web or otherwise, is no longer yours\nbecause you don’t own it.\nTo make matters even worse, companies all along the data-mining supply chain are\noften targeted by hackers. Since data storage is a relatively recent phenomenon,\nit’s also very loosely regulated and lacks guidelines for the protection of\nsensitive information. When a breach occurs, stolen data that includes your\nbanking details, home address, text messages, phone numbers, transactions,\nlocation history, and more is at risk of being used against you.\n\nAs the scandals surrounding data have grown in scale, so too has the push to\nmake each of us the rightful owners of our data.\n\nAre Decentralized Marketplaces a Better Way?\nData-mining is by and large done with the specific intention of getting better\nat selling you things. The more retailers know about what you want, the better\nthey can hone in on you and convince you to spend. This is specifically why the\neCommerce sector has become so keen on data mining.\n\nThanks to Satoshi and the blockchain, a new form of marketplace has risen over\nthe last few years. Did you know Satoshi had begun working on a decentralized\nmarketplace\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab77fab1995ede03fb934edd67f1359ba8]\n, entirely built on Bitcoin, before disappearing?\n\nDecentralized marketplaces look and feel like their centralized counterparts,\nbut they’re intended to give you full control over your data and, therefore,\ncomplete privacy. However, do they really improve upon the problem they’re\nsupposed to fix — or do they make it worse?\n\nDecentralized marketplaces run on public blockchains. The key word here is \npublic— meaning that your valuable information can be tracked and harvested by\nanyone with access to a block explorer. Complicating the situation are\nblockchain analytics firms that have become sophisticated enough to track down\nyour full transaction history, IP address, and personal details.\n\nDubious blockchain analytics startups are being bought out en masse by\nexchanges\nlike Coinbase\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com] \nwhile others breeze through high-dollar funding rounds. Data-mining has already\nproven to be extremely lucrative in the traditional e-commerce world, and\nblockchain has shown itself a worthy of replacing traditional networks. If you\nput two and two together, the reason for the current blockchain analytics gold\nrush is clear as day.\n\nToday’s blockchain analytics firms are tomorrow’s big data-harvesting\ncenters — and decentralized marketplaces without privacy measures in place won’t\nbe safe.\n\nTowards a Decentralized AND Private Marketplace\nInspired by the decentralized marketplace forebearers such as OpenBazaar, it\nseems that the only answer to the assault on our privacy is to take the\nblockchain marketplace model a step further and make it private by default.\n\nParticl [https://particl.io] is a blockchain analysis-resistant marketplace that\nis both decentralized and private. Your transaction details and identity are\nkept entirely anonymous — no one, no matter how hard they try, can collect your\ndata when you use the Particl platform.\n\nThat means your data is yours— it’ll never end up as runoff trickling into a\nmurky data silo someplace. Sure, we’ve heard critics claim that if you’ve got\nnothing to hide, then there’s no use for privacy. Unfortunately, such arguments\nmiss the point.\n\nBy hiding your data when buying or selling online, you aren’t implicitly\nadmitting to shady activity. You’re reclaiming the value inherent in your data\nand strengthening your digital autonomy. In the physical world, you wouldn’t\nstand for being followed or robbed — so why let those things happen to your\ndigital self?\n\nIn the digital era, data ownership is a fundamental human right, but we need the\ntools and resources for exercising that right. Particl Open Marketplace is just\nsuch a resource, and by using it, you stand up for not only your data but also\nthat of your peers.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Privacy-in-eCommerce---The-Need-to-Own-Your-Data/1-WppvYxW6cEpVySkXEJRezQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The world is an interconnected, nay, <em>hyper-connected</em> place.

Shoppers\nare increasingly turning down physical shopping locations like malls and big box\nstores as they opt to go online instead. Industry analysts expect that, by 2025,\nonline sales will surpass physical points of sale and will leave them in the\nrearview mirror for good. While online vendors should be rejoicing about such an\napparently prosperous state of affairs, many are wringing their hands and\nwondering about tomorrow.\n\nOnline retail is a notoriously competitive industry due to retail titans going\ntoe-to-toe with small vendors. Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Rakuten, and others\nharvest sales data before interpreting it with algorithms. This helps them\nidentify the most in-demand products, who is likely to buy them, and what\nproducts offer the best return on investments. Once those products are\ndetermined, this is where it gets ugly.\n\nAmazon’s Data-Driven Monopoly\nAmazon currently hosts upwards of 5 million vendors on their marketplace. You’d\nthink that with numbers like that, they’d be happy to collect a percentage of\nthe roughly $100 billion earned by those sellers in 2018. However, billions in\nprofit year on year and federal tax waivers aren’t enough to satisfy the\ngiant — Amazon wants your fees, your business, and you out of the game.\n\nAs a vendor, finding the right niche for your range of products is your bread\nand butter. All of the legwork it takes to find that niche means countless hours\nspent doing market research, outreach, and honing your business through trial\nand error. Amazon, on the other hand, is already three steps ahead of you. Their\nultra-fast algorithms perpetually scan billions of datasets floating across the\ninternet to identify trends. Predictive analysis techniques derived from their\nmillions of daily users give them a vast trove of information used to identify\nemerging trends.\n\nAll told, Amazon’s market momentum is built-in — they know what a buyer is going\nto buy before the buyer does, and the ship keeps sailing right along. Amazon’s\ncompounding centralization of retail power is their bottomless bags of\nmoney — they can afford to spare no expense in gathering the brightest minds to\nbuild their data analysis and AI tools. The result is a classic vicious cycle,\nas described by Kai-Fu Lee, an AI specialist:\n\n> “The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the\nmore data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you\ncan attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product.” —\nKai-Fu Lee\n[https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/]\nThe Blueprint of How Amazon Destroys Businesses\nAmazon, among other marketplaces, possesses all the data it needs to become the\nmost successful online vendor. It uses its sheer power to manufacture copies of\nthe best selling or most profitable items under its brand. It also accurately\ntargets shoppers with ads and product suggestions of the copied product. And,\nperhaps the most effective and nastiest of practices, it takes the listing of\nthe vendor it copied the product from and puts it way down in the list of\nresults. You were a successful vendor with an item rocking the top section of\nthe first page? Well, no more! Enjoy page 5 or 6. All of these practices ensure\nAmazon gets the cake and eat it too while severely undercutting the success of\nits own vendors.\n\nWhile using giant retail platforms may be convenient, they’re culling your vital\nbusiness data and using it to compete directly against you — all while you’re\npaying their high seller fees. Let’s get that clear here, vendors not only get\ntheir ideas and inventions stolen from them, they actually pay Amazon to do all\nthe research and market penetration testing for them.\n\nMarket efficiency is one thing, but market dictatorship is another. Amazon’s\ndata-driven monopoly is like a black hole at the center of the eCommerce\nuniverse — nothing escapes its pull. With no real competition, Amazon is left\nunrivaled to dictate trends and run circles around your business.\n\nKnocking Independent Retailers Out\nAmazon has unlimited access to both vendor and buyer analytics despite making\nvery few mentions of data collection in their terms and conditions. Imagine you\nhad access to an untold wealth of information regarding the exact product you’re\nputting on the market. With the who, what, when, and where sorted out, you’d be\nwell off. With the additional ability to instantly take the competition out of\nthe game, you’d then be an omniscient retail god — like Amazon.\n\nEvery time you make a sale, all of the data associated with it is bundled and\nparsed for actionable information. Amazon looks at both micro and macro trends\nsuch as how products are performing over time and what are their estimated\nrevenue. Remember, all of these calculations are automated by way of algorithms\nand use relevant, real-time customer spending habits and competitor data. These\nbits of information paint a picture of your items that lets Amazon know whether\nor not your particular product is ripe for copying.\n\nThe odds of your product being singled out increase the more popular your\nproduct is. While that in itself would normally make a retailer jump for joy,\nit’s become a cause for concern instead. Having a successful product means it’s\nalmost certain that your product will reappear at a lower price under the Amazon\nBasics brand — a benign-sounding name that belies the bane it’s become to\nvendors.\n\nDecentralizing the Global Marketplace\nThe issue mentioned in this article not only speaks about the lack of privacy in\ntraditional eCommerce but also about the problems introduced by omnipotent\ncentral authorities.\n\nBlockchain has given the world a new way to exchange value and conduct business\nwithout relying on any intermediary at all. It is nothing short of an economic\nparadigm shift. The significance of this shift has everything to do with\nempowering you with your original autonomy. In a centralized financial paradigm,\nyou have no choice but to rely on the myriad institutions built to give you one\noption — use them.\n\nThe decentralized paradigm made possible by blockchain is the opposite. You’re\nthe sovereign actor in your own financial universe. The blockchain is a thread\nconnecting you directly to your peers — rendering the middleman useless in the\nprocess. Clearly, blockchain is the perfect vehicle for launching a global\nmarketplace that is at once decentralized and entirely trustworthy. Sound a bit\ntoo good to be true? Well, that’s because it is.\n\nThe problem is also what makes blockchain so great for other applications: it’s\na publicly viewable ledger that permanently records all transaction data going\nthrough its system. In a public ledger, all of your transactions are on display,\nas if under the sun on a clear day. A marketplace using a public blockchain\nwould be \nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/611425/its-time-to-rein-in-the-data-barons/ 2\ndoing Amazon and other blue-chip retailers a massive favor — they’ll get a\nsharper view of the retail sector and get even more data.\n\nMoreover, like sharks that smell blood from miles away, data miners have begun\nallocating resources to the blockchain, forming analysis groups that are raking\nin big venture capital dollars (along with a few government contracts for good\nmeasure).

Today, we’d\nlike to dive deeper into the upcoming multi-wallet capabilities of Particl\nDesktop.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Multi-Wallets?\nMulti-Wallets, as they were displayed on previous test builds (subject\nto change)Multi-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been\navailable on Particl-Qt ever since Particl forked to codebase version 0.15. We\nare, however, now bringing this important feature onto our most popular client:\nParticl Desktop.\n\nWhat if you could manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop\ninstance? What if you could do it without breaking a sweat? This is exactly what\nthis multi-wallet feature allows you to do! It enables the ability to securely\nmanage multiple wallets from a single Particl Desktop instance without requiring\nyou to restart the wallet or mess with the wallet files (wallet.dat).\n\nWhen using multi-wallets, your identity, transaction history, and any other\nParticl-related data (i.e. listings, contact information, messages, etc) are\nperfectly isolated from the other wallets hosted on your Particl Desktop. This\nmakes it impossible for this information to leak into another wallet.\n\nMulti-wallets serve multiple purposes within the Particl ecosystem and will be\nan important feature moving forward. As time goes by, and as the Particl\ninfrastructure expands, they will become truly indispensable.\n\nSecurity & Privacy\nMulti-wallets are first and foremost a security and privacy feature. The reason\nwhy is that all the data from a wallet (i.e. transaction details, listings,\ncontact information, messages, votes, listing flags, etc) is perfectly isolated\nfrom other wallets installed on the same Particl Desktop. All multi-wallets are\nalso encrypted independently and have their own password.\n\nIn computer security, this ability can be compared pretty closely to the \nsecurity by isolation model. This model proposes that one of the best and most\neffective ways to secure data from multiple environments is by isolating them\nfrom each other. Particl Desktop achieves similar results by completely\nisolating the wallet files (wallet.dat) from each other.\n\nIn other words, if you are managing two (or more) different wallets from the\nsame Particl Desktop instance, it is as if you were managing them from different\ncomputers entirely. Wallet data cannot leak out into another wallet, just like\ndata from a computer cannot leak out into another computer by itself.\n\n> Note: This doesn’t mean your data is safe if your computer gets hacked into.\nWhile the wallet files themselves are isolated on the Particl Desktop client,\nthey are not isolated inside your computer itself. They are still stored in the\nsame place in your Particl configuration folder. The only way to secure your\nfunds against hackers that would breach into your computer is to store them on a\nhardware device like the Ledger Nano S (1 [https://particl.wiki/ledger], 2\n[https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking], 3\n[https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac]\n).\nSecurity — Eliminating Human Errors\nOf course, managing multiple wallets has always been kind of possible to do, but\nit’s definitely never been convenient. In fact, if you want to switch wallets on\nParticl Desktop without using multi-wallets, you can actually go through a\npainful manual routine that goes as follow:\n\n * Create a folder containing all of your wallet files (named differently)\n * Shut Particl Desktop down\n * Navigate to your Particl configuration folder\n * Backup your wallet.dat file and move it to the wallet folder you just created\n * Give it a different name (i.e. wallet_spending.dat)\n * In your wallet folder, pick the wallet file of the wallet you want to switch\n   to\n * Move it into your Particl configuration folder\n * Rename it to wallet.dat\n * Start Particl Desktop\n * Rinse and repeat every time you want to switch wallet\n\nAlmost cringeworthy, right? Not only is this very tedious set of steps a serious\nobstacle to regularly using multiple wallets, but it’s also a bit of a security\nrisk. That’s because, on a long enough timeline, we are all guaranteed to make\nmistakes. Indeed, research suggests that the great majority of information\nleaks\nand incidents are due to human errors\n[https://iapp.org/news/a/data-indicates-human-error-prevailing-cause-of-breaches-incidents/]\n, not hacks or malicious breaches.\n\nImage Source: iapp.org> “There is a tendency to assume incidents exposing\nsensitive, regulated data occur as a result of an organization being “under\nattack.” Seasoned privacy professionals, however, know that in reality, the\nmajority of incidents are inadvertent and unintentional, and can be classified\nas human error.” —Mahmood Sher-Jan\n[https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlQM8AAN/]\nWho’s to say you won’t ever forget to back a wallet file up before manually\nswitching? That you won’t overwrite a file by mistake? With multi-wallets, you\ndon’t need to worry about these human errors anymore. This feature makes\nswitching between wallets safe, quick, and easy.\n\nPrivacy — Address Association Prevention\nYou probably know by now that you shouldn’t reuse deposit addresses for privacy\nreasons. In fact, anyone that knows an address of yours can look it up on a\nblock explorer and analyze the transactions you’ve made with it in the past.\nWhat’s worse is that, not only can anyone look up your address on the\nblockchain, they can also do the same to all of the addresses associated,\ndirectly or indirectly, with it. To keep it simple, an address is “associated”\nwith another address if it has received or sent payments to it.\n\nImage Source: @iang (Steemit.com)This is why using new deposit addresses when\naccepting payments is the recommended behavior for the great majority of\ncryptocurrencies. To increase the number of users doing just that, more and more\ncrypto wallets have started generating brand new addresses by default when\nrequesting payments. This type of wallet is called a Hierarchical Deterministic\n(HD) wallet\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp]\n. It is what Particl uses for its wallet clients.\n\nThere are, however, other privacy-related issues that still stand unresolved.\nEven when receiving payments with new addresses, you can still easily reveal\nyour other ones. That’s because unused addresses get associated with any other\naddress to which it sends a payment to. It also gets associated with any address\nfurther down the transactional chain, meaning “associated addresses of\nassociated addresses”.\n\nIn other words, if someone sends you a payment to an unused address, and then\nafter some time you send that payment to your main stash, you effectively reveal\nyour main stash information (number of coins, who you’ve made and received\npayments to, who they’ve sent and received payments to as well, and etc) to the\nperson that paid you. Of course, blockchain analysis can reveal public addresses\nthat receive and send payments. It can’t, however, tell ‘who’ exactly the\naddresses belong to unless it is already known that an associated address\nbelongs to a certain entity (i.e. by sending funds to an exchange).\n\nWould you want a stranger to know how much you own? Would you want an exchange\nto know everything you do with your personal coins not stored on their platform?\nWould you want any person, organization, or company associated with blockchain\ndata analysis firms\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com] \nto be able to mine all of your data?\n\n> Last week, cryptocurrency industry giant Coinbase sparked outrage when it \nannounced\n[https://blog.coinbase.com/welcoming-neutrino-to-coinbase-b3f56171850d] that it\nhad purchased a small startup called Neutrino.Normally, such an acquisition\nwouldn’t make many waves, but Neutrino isn’t your average startup. The company\nwas founded by three former employees of Hacking Team\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=hacking+team+vice&oq=hacking+team+vice&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.4680j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8]\n, a controversial Italian surveillance vendor that was caught several times \nselling spyware to governments\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nzeg5x/here-are-all-the-sketchy-government-agencies-buying-hacking-teams-spy-tech] \nwith dubious human rights records, such as Ethiopia\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypwk4j/ethiopia-allegedly-used-spyware-against-us-based-journalists-again]\n, Saudi Arabia\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xvzyp/hacking-team-investor-saudi-arabia]\n, and Sudan. —Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/contributor/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai]\n\nWith these technologies becoming increasingly effective AND accessible, we need\nmore diverse and solid solutions to protect our digital privacy.\n\nPrivacy — Stop Mixing UTXOs\nWhat’s more, there is another privacy concern when making transactions after\nyour received payments. Let’s say you accept two 10 PART payments (20 PART\ntotal, deposited on two different unused addresses). Then, for some reason, you\nneed to make a payment worth 15 PART AFTER receiving your two 10 PART payments.\nEven though both payments were received on different addresses, making a 15 PART\npayment would use outputs from both addresses, effectively linking them\ntogether. That’s because these addresses have less than 15 PART, so coins from\nboth addresses need to be used.\n\nThis would effectively link both addresses since the party you send the payment\nto will see the funds coming from two different addresses. This is a big privacy\nissue (and the reason why the Coin Control feature of Particl-Qt is so\npowerful)!\n\nwtokensw.com> Note: In the example above, TX 6 used outputs from both TX 4 and TX5 (two\ndifferent addresses) to fund its inputs. Although both TX 4 and TX 5 were\nalready linked together because of TX 0 and TX 2, one of the output used to send\nfunds to TX 6 could have also come from a fictive TX 7 — an output not\npreviously associated with any part of that chain of transactions. This would\nlink TX 7 and TX 6 together, as well as all outputs and inputs directly or\nindirectly associated with TX 7 and TX 6.\nBy using multi-wallets, you can create new wallets every time you want to accept\npayments or use different wallets per types or categories of transactions (i.e.\na wallet to receive marketplace payments, another to receive staking rewards,\nanother to deposit and withdraw coins from exchanges, and etc).This method of\nsecuring your privacy by isolating the wallets from each other mix really well\nwith the privacy protocols of the PART coin. In fact, you can achieve much\nstronger privacy by combining RingCT/CT transactions to a solid wallet isolation\nstrategy.\n\nConvenience — How Do I Change Wallets?\nAs with everything Particl Desktop, convenience and ease-of-use is a big focus,\nbut there are no compromises made on the security end of things. Multi-wallets\nare directly in line with this approach and make switching between different\nwallets as easy as it can possibly be. Remember the tedious 9-step process for\nswitching wallets mentioned above? It’s been reduced to only one easy step:\n\n * Click on the tab of the wallet you want to use\n\nThat’s right, as simple as clicking a button! Ain’t that security made easy? No\nneed to rename or even mess with wallet.dat files, no need to restart Particl\nDesktop every time you want to switch wallets, and most importantly, no need to\npass on benefiting from security through isolation because the process of doing\nso is too annoying! ?\n\nCold Staking & Multi-Wallets — A Match Made in Heaven\nThis new multi-wallet feature is certainly a great security and privacy add-on\nto Particl Desktop, but its usefulness doesn’t stop there! In fact, each wallet\nhosted under the same Particl Desktop instance can be linked to its own cold\nstaking key. That means you can have multiple wallets staking from different\nsources, with different addresses to receive (or send) your staking rewards.\n\nLet’s say you have three different wallets and want to set your staking setup\nwith failsafe capabilities. You could then create three cold staking node, and\nlink each of them to a different wallet. If one node goes down, then only a part\nof your coins stop staking, not all of them. Even better, you could set up a\nnode on an RPi, one on a VPS, and use the public key of a cold staking pool as\nyour third node. This way, you would be staking from three different cold\nstaking nodes hosted under three very different environments. This adds a bit of\nredundancy to your staking setup and is a failsafe measure in case an issue\narises with one of the nodes.\n\nPerhaps even more interesting, though, is the ability to better manage staking\nrewards. With the possibility to stake on multiple nodes within the same Particl\nDesktop instance, multi-wallets enable a whole range of new possibilities. What\nif you don’t want to keep all your staking rewards in PART? What if you only\nwant to keep 50%, have 25% sent to an address used for trading and the other 25%\nas donations? What if you wanted to set multiple addresses up, each having its\nown purpose (i.e. spending, saving, trading, vacations, joint address with a\nloved one, purchases on the marketplace, health fund, and etc).\n\nDoing exactly this has always been possible, of course. All you needed to do was\nto set up multiple wallets and cycle through them using the tedious 9-step\nprocess mentioned above. But now, with multi-wallets, it’s going to be as easy,\naccessible, and quick as it’s ever been!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMulti-wallets bring added privacy, security, and convenience to Particl Desktop\nand open a lot of possibilities for almost every type of users.

Let’s say you accept two 10 PART payments (20 PART total, deposited on two different unused addresses). Then, for some reason, you need to make a payment worth 15 PART AFTER receiving your two 10 PART payments. Even though both payments were received on different addresses, <strong>making a 15 PART payment would use outputs from both addresses, </strong>effectively linking them together. That’s because these addresses have less than 15 PART, so coins from both addresses need to be used.</p><p>This would effectively link both addresses since the party you send the payment to will see the funds coming from two different addresses. This is a big privacy issue (and the reason why the Coin Control feature of Particl-Qt is so powerful)!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-ZssJx1GKIGhEZio_xOdfmg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>wtokensw.com</figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>In the example above, TX 6 used outputs from both TX 4 and TX5 (two different addresses) to fund its inputs. Although both TX 4 and TX 5 were already linked together because of TX 0 and TX 2, one of the output used to send funds to TX 6 could have also come from a fictive TX 7 — an output not previously associated with any part of that chain of transactions. This would link TX 7 and TX 6 together, as well as all outputs and inputs directly or indirectly associated with TX 7 and TX 6.</blockquote><p>By using multi-wallets, you can create new wallets every time you want to accept payments or use different wallets per types or categories of transactions (i.e. a wallet to receive marketplace payments, another to receive staking rewards, another to deposit and withdraw coins from exchanges, and etc).This method of securing your privacy by isolating the wallets from each other mix really well with the privacy protocols of the PART coin. In fact, <strong>you can achieve much stronger privacy by combining RingCT/CT transactions to a solid wallet isolation strategy.</strong></p><h3 id=\"convenience-how-do-i-change-wallets\"><strong>Convenience — How Do I Change Wallets?</strong></h3><p>As with everything Particl Desktop, convenience and ease-of-use is a big focus, but there are no compromises made on the security end of things. Multi-wallets are directly in line with this approach and make switching between different wallets as easy as it can possibly be. <strong>Remember the </strong><a href=\"#009d\"><strong>tedious 9-step process for switching wallets</strong></a><strong> mentioned above? It’s been reduced to only one easy step:</strong></p><ul><li>Click on the tab of the wallet you want to use</li></ul><p>That’s right, as simple as clicking a button! Ain’t that security made easy? No need to rename or even mess with wallet.dat files, no need to restart Particl Desktop every time you want to switch wallets, and most importantly, no need to pass on benefiting from <em>security through isolation </em>because the process of doing so is too annoying! ?</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-multi-wallets-a-match-made-in-heaven\">Cold Staking &amp; Multi-Wallets — A Match Made in Heaven</h3><p>This new multi-wallet feature is certainly a great security and privacy add-on to Particl Desktop, but its usefulness doesn’t stop there! In fact, each wallet hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance can be linked to its own cold staking key. That means you can have multiple wallets staking from different sources, with different addresses to receive (or send) your staking rewards.</p><p>Let’s say you have three different wallets and want to set your staking setup with failsafe capabilities. You could then create three cold staking node, and link each of them to a different wallet. If one node goes down, then only a part of your coins stop staking, not all of them. Even better, you could set up a node on an RPi, one on a VPS, and use the public key of a cold staking pool as your third node. This way, you would be staking from three different cold staking nodes hosted under three very different environments. This adds a bit of redundancy to your staking setup and is a failsafe measure in case an issue arises with one of the nodes.</p><p>Perhaps even more interesting, though, is the ability to better manage staking rewards. With the possibility to stake on multiple nodes within the same Particl Desktop instance, multi-wallets enable a whole range of new possibilities. What if you don’t want to keep all your staking rewards in PART? What if you only want to keep 50%, have 25% sent to an address used for trading and the other 25% as donations? What if you wanted to set multiple addresses up, each having its own purpose (i.e. spending, saving, trading, vacations, joint address with a loved one, purchases on the marketplace, health fund, and etc).</p><p>Doing exactly this has always been possible, of course. All you needed to do was to set up multiple wallets and cycle through them using the <a href=\"#009d\"><strong>tedious 9-step process</strong></a> mentioned above.

In fact, they have been available on Particl-Qt ever since Particl forked to codebase version 0.15. We are, however, now bringing this important feature onto our most popular client: Particl Desktop.</p><p>What if you could manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance? What if you could do it without breaking a sweat? This is exactly what this multi-wallet feature allows you to do! It enables the ability to securely manage multiple wallets from a single Particl Desktop instance without requiring you to restart the wallet or mess with the wallet files (wallet.dat).</p><p>When using multi-wallets, your identity, transaction history, and any other Particl-related data (i.e. listings, contact information, messages, etc) are perfectly isolated from the other wallets hosted on your Particl Desktop. This makes it impossible for this information to leak into another wallet.</p><p>Multi-wallets serve multiple purposes within the Particl ecosystem and will be an important feature moving forward. As time goes by, and as the Particl infrastructure expands, they will become truly indispensable.</p><h2 id=\"security-privacy\">Security &#x26; Privacy</h2><p>Multi-wallets are first and foremost a security and privacy feature. The reason why is that all the data from a wallet (i.e. transaction details, listings, contact information, messages, votes, listing flags, etc) is perfectly isolated from other wallets installed on the same Particl Desktop. All multi-wallets are also encrypted independently and have their own password.</p><p>In computer security, this ability can be compared pretty closely to the <em><strong>security by isolation </strong></em>model. This model proposes that one of the best and most effective ways to secure data from multiple environments is by isolating them from each other. Particl Desktop achieves similar results by completely isolating the wallet files (wallet.dat) from each other.</p><p>In other words, <strong>if you are managing two (or more) different wallets from the same Particl Desktop instance, it is as if you were managing them from different computers entirely</strong>. Wallet data cannot leak out into another wallet, just like data from a computer cannot leak out into another computer by itself.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This doesn’t mean your data is safe if your computer gets hacked into. While the wallet files themselves are isolated on the Particl Desktop client, they are not isolated inside your computer itself. They are still stored in the same place in your Particl configuration folder. The only way to secure your funds against hackers that would breach into your computer is to store them on a hardware device like the Ledger Nano S (<a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\"><strong>2</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac\"><strong>3</strong></a>).</blockquote><h3 id=\"security-eliminating-human-errors\">Security — Eliminating Human Errors</h3><p>Of course, managing multiple wallets has always been<em> kind of</em> possible to do, but it’s definitely never been convenient. In fact, if you want to switch wallets on Particl Desktop without using multi-wallets, you can actually go through a painful manual routine that goes as follow:</p><ul><li>Create a folder containing all of your wallet files (named differently)</li><li>Shut Particl Desktop down</li><li>Navigate to your Particl configuration folder</li><li>Backup your wallet.dat file and move it to the wallet folder you just created</li><li>Give it a different name (i.e. wallet_spending.dat)</li><li>In your wallet folder, pick the wallet file of the wallet you want to switch to</li><li>Move it into your Particl configuration folder</li><li>Rename it to wallet.dat</li><li>Start Particl Desktop</li><li>Rinse and repeat every time you want to switch wallet</li></ul><p>Almost cringeworthy, right? Not only is this very tedious set of steps a serious obstacle to regularly using multiple wallets, but it’s also a bit of a security risk. That’s because, on a long enough timeline, we are all guaranteed to make mistakes. Indeed, <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/data-indicates-human-error-prevailing-cause-of-breaches-incidents/\"><strong>research suggests that the great majority of information leaks and incidents are due to human errors</strong></a>, not hacks or malicious breaches.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-evJaI7FtM6TigszkiDFhOA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Image Source: iapp.org</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“There is a tendency to assume incidents exposing sensitive, regulated data occur as a result of an organization being “under attack.” Seasoned privacy professionals, however, know that in reality, the majority of incidents are inadvertent and unintentional, and can be classified as human error.” — <a href=\"https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlQM8AAN/\">Mahmood Sher-Jan</a></blockquote><p>Who’s to say you won’t ever forget to back a wallet file up before manually switching? That you won’t overwrite a file by mistake? With multi-wallets, you don’t need to worry about these human errors anymore. This feature makes switching between wallets <strong>safe</strong>, <strong>quick</strong>, and <strong>easy</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"privacy-address-association-prevention\">Privacy — Address Association Prevention</h3><p>You probably know by now that you shouldn’t reuse deposit addresses for privacy reasons. In fact, anyone that knows an address of yours can look it up on a block explorer and analyze the transactions you’ve made with it in the past. What’s worse is that, not only can anyone look up your address on the blockchain, they can also do the same to all of the addresses associated, directly or indirectly, with it. To keep it simple, an address is “associated” with another address if it has received or sent payments to it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-6_Hg2rf31nErsKnFK0k4Tw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Image Source: @iang (Steemit.com)</figcaption></figure><p>This is why using new deposit addresses when accepting payments is the recommended behavior for the great majority of cryptocurrencies. To increase the number of users doing just that, more and more crypto wallets have started generating brand new addresses by default when requesting payments. This type of wallet is called a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp\"><strong>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet</strong></a><strong>. </strong>It is what Particl uses for its wallet clients.</p><p>There are, however, other privacy-related issues that still stand unresolved. Even when receiving payments with new addresses, you can still easily reveal your other ones. That’s because unused addresses get associated with any other address to which it sends a payment to. It also gets associated with any address further down the transactional chain, meaning “associated addresses of associated addresses”.</p><p>In other words, if someone sends you a payment to an unused address, and then after some time you send that payment to your main stash, you effectively reveal your main stash information (number of coins, who you’ve made and received payments to, who they’ve sent and received payments to as well, and etc) to the person that paid you. Of course, blockchain analysis can reveal public addresses that receive and send payments. It can’t, however, tell ‘who’ exactly the addresses belong to <strong>unless it is already known that an associated address belongs to a certain entity </strong>(i.e. by sending funds to an exchange).</p><p>Would you want a stranger to know how much you own?

This feature has now successfully been implemented\non RegTest (pre-testnet) and is fully working\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]. Some of the Particl\ndevelopers are now using the time between now and the mainnet release to make it\nmore resource-efficient and smoother to use. As Arnold Bansemer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] says, “Better to use the time we have until\nthe release to get it done properly now rather than just enough to make it work”\n.\n\nRealigns market-beta branch with market branch by zaSmilingIdiot · Pull Request\n#1512 ·… [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]\nThis opts for the non-destructive (albeit 'muddy') commit history. This is in\npreparation for reviewing and merging of…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]\n\nThe multi-wallets feature should hit testnet somewhere this week or early next\nweek. Visit particl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826] \n later this week as we will publish a full article explaining everything there\nis to know about multi-wallets.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nDemonstrating in real-time the Open Marketplace in Hong Kong has been a very\nconstructive exercise. It showed the current V2.0 build to be pretty stable and\nable to handle hours of demonstration without really causing any issue. It has\nalso been the best opportunity we’ve ever had to test the decentralized\ngovernance mechanism of the marketplace.\n\nIn fact, while we were at the conference demonstrating the marketplace,\nundesirable products started to be listed by some testnet user. Remember, the\nOpen Marketplace is entirely decentralized. No party can singlehandedly remove\nlistings from it. Still, we wanted to keep the marketplace as clean as possible\nas we were showing it off.\n\nLuckily, the Particl testnet network is different from the mainnet network. It\nis tweaked in a way where the Particl team holds a large sum of testnet coins.\nThis is to ensure the network can run smoothly with a low number of nodes and\nthat the team can easily test the decentralized governance mechanism.\n\nWe did successfully take those listings off using the builds we had at the\nconference. This confirms and validates that the decentralized governance\nmechanism is now ready for mainnet!\n\nCT Escrow (Privacy Enabled by Default)\nThe implementation of CT transactions in the escrow smart-contract makes all\nmarketplace transactions untraceable — amounts will be hidden — by default. This\nrequires a special form of escrow that processes transactions using only CT. —\nSee OMP Library and Bitcoin 0.18 below for more info.\n\nThe Particl developers already have a working escrow in RegTest (pre-testnet)\nthat works using RingCT transactions only. By playing around with it, they\nrealized modifying it so that it could work using CT transactions (instead of\nRingCT) would be relatively easy. It would also protect the integrity of the\nproject. Particl is, after all, a privacy-focused project. It is not looking\ninto compromising privacy or security for anything else. This is why we’ve\ndecided to implement CT transactions before releasing the Open Marketplace on\nmainnet.\n\nAs it stands today, the escrow mechanism has been successfully converted to work\nwith CT transactions. The team is currently fine-tuning some of the system’s\nparameters and working on the full integration into the marketplace. This escrow\nsystem will effectively replace the one currently in place on testnet.\n\nThe good news is that most of the heavy lifting has already been done in regards\nto this task. The integration and fine-tuning processes are trivial in\ncomparison.\n\nOMP Library\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is based on the Open Market Protocol (OMP)\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/] developed by Particl developer \nKewde [https://github.com/kewde]. It is a standardized and open format\ncontaining most of the economic interactions of an online marketplace. This\nlibrary gives the Open Marketplace’s backend much more flexibility and options\nthan it currently has. While it was already implemented into the marketplace, \nits full integration is necessary for the new escrow model to function.\n\nExcept for the new CT escrow, the OMP Library will not offer any\nnoticeable/visible improvements until some point in the future. In fact, all it\ndoes is give the back-end of the marketplace more tools and parameters to\nleverage (i.e. custom listing fields\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/public-listing-format/extended/extended-listing.html]\n, escrow refunds & negotiations\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/private-message-format/overview.html]\n, etc). The library will, however, prove itself to be essential as we move\nforward into the Beta phase of development.\n\nThe OMP Library is still currently being implemented into the marketplace and\nParticl Desktop application.\n\nUI/UX Tweaks\nNew Hover Function Shows Spendable, Locked, and Total Balance Anywhere on\nParticl DesktopWhile we were presenting the marketplace in Hong Kong, we met\nmany people coming from different backgrounds and with different experiences.\nThis has generated for us a long list of feedback, comments, and suggestions,\nlots of them being about UI/UX improvements.\n\nSome of our developers have taken this list and started implementing the\nsuggestions we think will improve the user experience. These tweaks are minor\nand won’t take much time to resolve. They are not function-related issues, but\nmerely visual fixes. At this moment, The Open Marketplace’s interface is ready\nfor mainnet. These tweaks will only make it better.\n\nBitcoin Codebase 0.18\nHave you noticed that all the latest testnet versions of the Open Marketplace\nhave been running on Particl Core 0.18 while the mainnet version of Particl\nDesktop still operates on Particl Core 0.17? That’s because most of the\nmodifications we’ve made to the marketplace in the last few weeks have been\nbuilt with Particl Core 0.18 in mind.\n\nThere have been lots of issues when testing testnet (0.18) within the same\nenvironment as a mainnet wallet (0.17). This is due to a so-called “backward\ncompatibility” issue — some of the new features may need to be integrated\ndifferently on 0.17 than on 0.18. Yes, we are definitely serious when praising \nTecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert] for his amazing work. Keeping Particl’s\ncodebase, as well as everything built on top of it, up-to-date with Bitcoin’s\nlatest core version is a complex, ever-evolving, and time-consuming task.\n\nWe’ve been following the development of Bitcoin Core 0.18 very closely. We’ve\nalso been constantly preparing all the changes required for the update\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]. Earlier this month,\nthe Bitcoin developers have released the tentative release date of April 3rd for\nthe 0.18 Bitcoin update.\n\nRelease schedule for 0.18.0 · Issue #14438 · bitcoin/bitcoin\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]\nHere is a proposed release schedule for 0.18.0, the next major release of\nBitcoin Core. Like for previous major…\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]github.com\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]\n\n * Click here to read the full Bitcoin Core 0.18 Release Notes\n   [https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.18.0-Release-Notes-Draft]\n\nSince the release date of Bitcoin Core is scheduled for after the end of Q1, we\nwould need to modify a lot of components of the marketplace so that they could\nwork on Particl Core 0.17. They would then need to be reverted back to their\ninitial form (built for 0.18) only a few days after the first mainnet release.\nThis would be an unnecessarily time-consuming process that wouldn’t provide any\nadded benefit to the marketplace. This is the main driver for why the mainnet\nrelease of the “official” Open Marketplace builds will go just a few days into\nQ2.\n\nWe’ve also always said we didn’t want to release a Bitcoin codebase version\nprior to Bitcoin doing it. This is not only a mark of respect for the developers\nworking on this incredible codebase but a security measure for the Particl\nproject. This is why we always wait a couple of days before updating our\ncodebase — should there be any issue on Bitcoin’s end, we would wait for it to\nbe resolved before updating our codebase.\n\nThis is why we have taken the decision to wait for Particl Core to update to its\n0.18 version before releasing the marketplace on mainnet. Not only will this\nsave a good amount of development time (which will be used more efficiently),\nbut it will also allow developers to keep perfecting the release and run more\ntests while we wait for the Particl Core 0.18 update.\n\n> Note: The current Alpha Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 has successfully been tested\non mainnet. There hasn’t been any new identifiable issue as a result of this\ninternal test.\nGeneral Small Tweaks & Fixes\nAs always, the Particl developers are constantly making tweaks, fixes, and\nimprovements to all the components of the marketplace. This will always be the\ncase as we strive to offer the best, blockchain product in the industry, bar\nnone. Don’t forget to log any feedback, suggestion, bug, or comment on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. This is the best way to\nattract the attention of one of Particl’s developers and is the quickest way to\nmake changes happen!\n\n> NOTE: For more information about what item are being worked on and reviewed,\nplease visit the Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report/] page on\nParticl.io\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainnet Release Timeframe\nWith all the above considered, we’d like to make the mainnet release timeframe\nclearer. At this moment, we’ve successfully tested the Open Marketplace Alpha\n2.0 on mainnet, without any issue. We will, however, publicly release the first\nmainnet version of it only after Particl Core 0.18 is released —taking us into\nmid-April if the current Bitcoin release schedule\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438] sticks. That’s because we need\nto let Bitcoin Core 0.18 run on Bitcoin for a couple of days, make sure no issue\narises, update Particl Core to 0.18, and then push the Open Marketplace on\nmainnet.\n\nThe short time between now and the date of the mainnet release for the\nmarketplace will allow Particl developers to implement the changes and fixes\nidentified in TOKEN2049 as well as fine-tune and improve the initial mainnet\nfeatures (CT escrow, multi-wallets, interface, etc). This small extra time will\nalso allow them to run more tests and deliver a more stable first mainnet build.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you’ve been looking into selling and buying stuff on the Open Marketplace,\nthen now is definitely the time to get prepared! Particl is going to unlock the\nfull potential of global online commerce and will lead to the biggest revolution\nthe eCommerce sector has ever had. It only gets more exciting from this point\nonward.\n\nWe have a lot of content coming in the next few days — announcements, future\nfeatures sneak peeks, explainers, blog posts, videos, tutorials, and etc. Don’t\nmiss any of it by joining us on the awesome Particl Discord\n[http://discord.me/particl] server!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Marketplace-Development-Update/1-XhMg71IgwzJvwt1wCmxSOQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"mainnet-features-progress-outstanding-items\">Mainnet Features, Progress, &amp; Outstanding Items</h3><p>We packed our bags and headed off to TOKEN2049 last week with the Open Marketplace in tow.

It showed the current V2.0 build to be pretty stable and able to handle hours of demonstration without really causing any issue. It has also been the best opportunity we’ve ever had to test the decentralized governance mechanism of the marketplace.</p><p>In fact, while we were at the conference demonstrating the marketplace, undesirable products started to be listed by some testnet user. Remember, the Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized. No party can singlehandedly remove listings from it. Still, we wanted to keep the marketplace as clean as possible as we were showing it off.</p><p>Luckily, the Particl testnet network is different from the mainnet network. It is tweaked in a way where the Particl team holds a large sum of testnet coins. This is to ensure the network can run smoothly with a low number of nodes and that the team can easily test the decentralized governance mechanism.</p><p>We did successfully take those listings off using the builds we had at the conference. <strong>This confirms and validates that the decentralized governance mechanism is now ready for mainnet!</strong></p><h3 id=\"ct-escrow-privacy-enabled-by-default-\">CT Escrow (Privacy Enabled by Default)</h3><p>The implementation of CT transactions in the escrow smart-contract makes all marketplace transactions untraceable — amounts will be hidden — by default. This requires a special form of escrow that processes transactions using only CT. — <em>See OMP Library and Bitcoin 0.18 below for more info.</em></p><p>The Particl developers already have a working escrow in RegTest (pre-testnet) that works using RingCT transactions only. By playing around with it, they realized modifying it so that it could work using CT transactions (instead of RingCT) would be relatively easy. It would also protect the integrity of the project. Particl is, after all, a privacy-focused project. It is not looking into compromising privacy or security for anything else. This is why we’ve decided to implement CT transactions before releasing the Open Marketplace on mainnet.</p><p>As it stands today, <strong>the escrow mechanism has been successfully converted to work with CT transactions. The team is currently fine-tuning some of the system’s parameters and working on the full integration into the marketplace.</strong> This escrow system will effectively replace the one currently in place on testnet.</p><p>The good news is that most of the heavy lifting has already been done in regards to this task. The integration and fine-tuning processes are trivial in comparison.</p><h3 id=\"omp-library\">OMP Library</h3><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is based on the <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>Open Market Protocol (OMP)</strong></a> developed by Particl developer <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a>. It is a standardized and open format containing most of the economic interactions of an online marketplace.

It is a standardized and open format containing most of the economic interactions of an online marketplace.

This has generated for us a long list of feedback, comments, and suggestions, lots of them being about UI/UX improvements.</p><p>Some of our developers have taken this list and started implementing the suggestions we think will improve the user experience. <strong>These tweaks are minor and won’t take much time to resolve.</strong> They are not function-related issues, but merely visual fixes.<strong> At this moment, The Open Marketplace’s interface is ready for mainnet. </strong>These<strong> </strong>tweaks will only make it better.</p><h3 id=\"bitcoin-codebase-0-18\">Bitcoin Codebase 0.18</h3><p>Have you noticed that all the latest testnet versions of the Open Marketplace have been running on Particl Core 0.18 while the mainnet version of Particl Desktop still operates on Particl Core 0.17? That’s because most of the modifications we’ve made to the marketplace in the last few weeks have been built with Particl Core 0.18 in mind.</p><p>There have been lots of issues when testing testnet (0.18) within the same environment as a mainnet wallet (0.17). This is due to a so-called “backward compatibility” issue — some of the new features may need to be integrated differently on 0.17 than on 0.18. Yes, we are definitely serious when praising <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a> for his amazing work. Keeping Particl’s codebase, as well as everything built on top of it, up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest core version is a complex, ever-evolving, and time-consuming task.</p><p>We’ve been following the development of Bitcoin Core 0.18 very closely. We’ve also been <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\">constantly preparing all the changes required for the update</a>. Earlier this month, the Bitcoin developers have released the <strong>tentative release date of April 3rd </strong>for the 0.18 Bitcoin update.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><strong>Release schedule for 0.18.0 · Issue #14438 · bitcoin/bitcoin</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><em>Here is a proposed release schedule for 0.18.0, the next major release of Bitcoin Core. Like for previous major…</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\">github.com</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.18.0-Release-Notes-Draft\"><strong>Click here to read the full Bitcoin Core 0.18 Release Notes</strong></a></li></ul><p>Since the release date of Bitcoin Core is scheduled for after the end of Q1, we would need to modify a lot of components of the marketplace so that they could work on Particl Core 0.17. They would then need to be reverted back to their initial form (built for 0.18) only a few days after the first mainnet release. This would be an unnecessarily time-consuming process that wouldn’t provide any added benefit to the marketplace. This is the main driver for why the mainnet release of the “official” Open Marketplace builds will go just a few days into Q2.</p><p>We’ve also always said we didn’t want to release a Bitcoin codebase version prior to Bitcoin doing it. This is not only a mark of respect for the developers working on this incredible codebase but a security measure for the Particl project. This is why we always wait a couple of days before updating our codebase — should there be any issue on Bitcoin’s end, we would wait for it to be resolved before updating our codebase.</p><p>This is why <strong>we have taken the decision to wait for Particl Core to update to its 0.18 version before releasing the marketplace on mainnet.</strong> Not only will this save a good amount of development time (which will be used more efficiently), but it will also allow developers to keep perfecting the release and run more tests while we wait for the Particl Core 0.18 update.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The current Alpha Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 has successfully been tested on mainnet. There hasn’t been any new identifiable issue as a result of this internal test.</blockquote><h3 id=\"general-small-tweaks-fixes\">General Small Tweaks &#x26; Fixes</h3><p>As always, the Particl developers are constantly making tweaks, fixes, and improvements to all the components of the marketplace. This will always be the case as we strive to offer the best, blockchain product in the industry, bar none. Don’t forget to <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>log any feedback, suggestion, bug, or comment on Github</strong></a>. This is the best way to attract the attention of one of Particl’s developers and is the quickest way to make changes happen!</p><blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> For more information about what item are being worked on and reviewed, please visit the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on Particl.io</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"mainnet-release-timeframe\">Mainnet Release Timeframe</h2><p>With all the above considered, we’d like to make the mainnet release timeframe clearer. At this moment, <strong>we’ve successfully tested the Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on mainnet, without any issue. </strong>We will, however, publicly release the first mainnet version of it only after Particl Core 0.18 is released — <strong>taking us into mid-April</strong> if the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><strong>current Bitcoin release schedule</strong></a> sticks. That’s because we need to let Bitcoin Core 0.18 run on Bitcoin for a couple of days, make sure no issue arises, update Particl Core to 0.18, and then push the Open Marketplace on mainnet.</p><p>The short time between now and the date of the mainnet release for the marketplace will allow Particl developers to implement the changes and fixes identified in TOKEN2049 as well as fine-tune and improve the initial mainnet features (CT escrow, multi-wallets, interface, etc). This small extra time will also allow them to run more tests and deliver a more stable first mainnet build.</p><hr><p>If you’ve been looking into selling and buying stuff on the Open Marketplace, then now is definitely the time to get prepared! Particl is going to unlock the full potential of global online commerce and will lead to the biggest revolution the eCommerce sector has ever had. It only gets more exciting from this point onward.</p><p>We have a lot of content coming in the next few days — announcements, future features sneak peeks, explainers, blog posts, videos, tutorials, and etc. Don’t miss any of it by joining us on the awesome <a href=\"http://discord.me/particl\"><strong>Particl Discord</strong></a> server!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Marketplace-Development-Update/1-NMEvuybN3TCOZtC_cmCRPA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Marketplace-Development-Update/1-XhMg71IgwzJvwt1wCmxSOQ.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"mainnet-features-progress-outstanding-items"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Mainnet Features, Progress, & Outstanding Items"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We packed our bags and headed off to TOKEN2049 last week with the Open Marketplace in tow.

The Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 has just been\nreleased on Github and is now available for all to play with.\n\nThis version is going to be unlike other testnet versions we’ve seen in the\nrecent past. Unlike our testing community builds that expire after 10 days, this\nstable build will be available for download on the website, as well as in the \nRelease [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] page of our\nParticl Desktop Github repository.\n\nThis is also the build that the team will be demonstrating at next week’s \nTOKEN2049 conference\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b] \n in Hong Kong.\n\nWe’d also like to take this opportunity to give you all a small update on Alpha,\nBeta, and the upcoming mainnet release of the marketplace! But first, let’s get\ndown to the details about this testnet release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started With V2.0\nDownload and get started with testing the Open Marketplace by following this\nGithub link:\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]\n\n> Client Version: 2.0.0-alpha-testnetMarket: v0.0.51\nParticl Core: v0.18.0.4\n\nTestnet Faucet (get free testnet coins): http://faucet.particl.xyz/\n\nPlease, continue logging any issue you may encounter on the Issue section\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] of our Github page.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImportant Note\nFor those of you that have tested the marketplace on testnet a long time before, \nyou will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you will\nencounter errors. This will be sorted out in the future but is highly\nrecommended for the moment.\n\nIf you’ve been testing the more recent marketplace community builds, then that\nstep shouldn’t be necessary anymore, although if you encounter any problem,\nclearing your marketplace database is always a good option to fix most issues.\n\nThe location of your particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\nWindows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n\nmacOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n\nLinux:~/.particl-market\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog\n * New logo\n * Bug fixes\n * Stability improvements\n * No download link expiry\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSoft Rebrand\nAs we are moving forward, the project is going to go through a soft rebrand,\nwith today’s release being the first step towards that process. As you probably\nnoticed, this marketplace build now features a brand new logo instead of the old\none. The soft rebrand refreshes the color palette and logo of the project. We\nwill be releasing another blog post later today explaining the details of this\nsoft rebrand and the reasoning behind it.\n\nAlpha, Beta, and the Way Forward\nEarlier this week, we mentioned we were targeting today to be the final date for\nthe Alpha version. This was intended to be this way so that we could time the\nend of the Alpha phase of development with the TOKEN2049 conference. However,\nwhile a portion of our developers was fixing bugs and improving the stability of\nthe build, the other portion made some significant progress on a couple of other\nfeatures that we would like to integrate into Alpha.\n\nFor this reason, we have taken the decision to extend the Alpha phase of\ndevelopment for a few days in order to bring these features on the Alpha build\nand ensure that they are part of our first mainnet version. These features are:\n\n * Multi-wallet capabilities\n * Blinded escrow\n * OMP Library\n\nMulti-wallet: This feature adds the ability to manage multiple wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is useful for both usability and, most\nimportantly, security. Wallets managed by the same unique Particl Desktop are\nentirely isolated from each other, meaning no data is shared between wallets.\nThis will allow buyers, vendors, and users to set multiple profiles and enhance\ntheir security setup.\n\nBlinded escrow: While RingCT and Bulletproofs are available on testnet, they are\nnot available on mainnet. For this reason, and because we’re first and foremost\na privacy project, we’ve opted to integrate CT transactions right into Particl’s\nescrow. Because we already had an escrow system integrated with RingCT on\nRegtest (pre-testnet), we’ve decided to substitute RingCT for CT and bring that\nmodification onto testnet. Progress made on that front has been super fast, and\nfor this reason, we’ve decided to launch our first mainnet version with CT\nescrow enabled by default, effectively making the Open Marketplace private by\ndefault from Day 1. This won’t be as strong as RingCT escrow, but it sure is\nmultiple times more private than a simple pseudonymous escrow setup.\n\nOMP Library: The OMP Library is a protocol that brings various enhancements and\nattributes to the back-end of the marketplace. It is a requirement to\nsuccessfully implement CT escrows and also adds a couple of security-related\nenhancements to it. The attributes it adds will be able to be leveraged by\nParticl Desktop in the future to put more information in listings and better\ncategorize products. For more information about the OMP Library, head over to\nits documentation by following this link: \nhttps://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\n\nBeta & Mainnet\nFollowing the implementation of these features, Alpha will end and Beta will\nstart immediately thereafter. At the same time, Alpha will move up to mainnet as\na private by default marketplace from Day 1. This Alpha phase of development\nextension shouldn’t affect the targeted release timeframe for mainnet too much,\nif at all, but it will bring features that will significantly increase the value\nand privacy of the product itself. In other words, we are still aiming for a\nmainnet release before the end of Q1 2019.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of this in mind, stay tuned for a new testnet build that should contain\nthe newly introduced multi-wallet feature within the next week or so. In the\nmeantime, you can now enjoy the super Particl Open Marketplace V2.0 and share it\nwith your friends and peers without any fear that the links might expire!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Alpha-V2-0-Release---Development-Update/1-4UH5cHbZBKAPH1DIlBuatw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>It’s finally here!</strong> The Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 has just been released on Github and is now available for all to play with.</p><p>This version is going to be unlike other testnet versions we’ve seen in the recent past.

We will be releasing another blog post later today explaining the details of this soft rebrand and the reasoning behind it.</p><h2 id=\"alpha-beta-and-the-way-forward\">Alpha, Beta, and the Way Forward</h2><p>Earlier this week, we mentioned we were targeting today to be the <em>final</em> date for the Alpha version. This was intended to be this way so that we could time the end of the Alpha phase of development with the TOKEN2049 conference. However, while a portion of our developers was fixing bugs and improving the stability of the build, the other portion made some significant progress on a couple of other features that we would like to integrate into Alpha.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>we have taken the decision to extend the Alpha phase of development for a few days</strong> in order to bring these features on the Alpha build and ensure that they are part of our first mainnet version. These features are:</p><ul><li>Multi-wallet capabilities</li><li>Blinded escrow</li><li>OMP Library</li></ul><p><strong>Multi-wallet: </strong>This feature adds the ability to manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance. This is useful for both usability and, most importantly, security. Wallets managed by the same unique Particl Desktop are entirely isolated from each other, meaning no data is shared between wallets. This will allow buyers, vendors, and users to set multiple profiles and enhance their security setup.</p><p><strong>Blinded escrow:</strong> While RingCT and Bulletproofs are available on testnet, they are not available on mainnet. For this reason, and because we’re first and foremost a privacy project, we’ve opted to integrate CT transactions right into Particl’s escrow. Because we already had an escrow system integrated with RingCT on Regtest (pre-testnet), we’ve decided to substitute RingCT for CT and bring that modification onto testnet. Progress made on that front has been super fast, and for this reason, we’ve decided to launch our first mainnet version with CT escrow enabled by default, effectively making the Open Marketplace <strong>private by default from Day 1</strong>. This won’t be as strong as RingCT escrow, but it sure is multiple times more private than a simple pseudonymous escrow setup.</p><p><strong>OMP Library:</strong> The OMP Library is a protocol that brings various enhancements and attributes to the back-end of the marketplace. It is a requirement to successfully implement CT escrows and also adds a couple of security-related enhancements to it. The attributes it adds will be able to be leveraged by Particl Desktop in the future to put more information in listings and better categorize products. For more information about the OMP Library, head over to its documentation by following this link: <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/</strong></a></p><h3 id=\"beta-mainnet\">Beta &#x26; Mainnet</h3><p>Following the implementation of these features, Alpha will end and Beta will start immediately thereafter. At the same time, Alpha will move up to mainnet as a private by default marketplace from Day 1. <strong>This Alpha phase of development extension shouldn’t affect the targeted release timeframe for mainnet too much, if at all</strong>, but it will bring features that will significantly increase the value and privacy of the product itself. In other words, we are still aiming for a mainnet release before the end of Q1 2019.</p><hr><p>With all of this in mind, stay tuned for a new testnet build that should contain the newly introduced multi-wallet feature within the next week or so. In the meantime, you can now enjoy the super Particl Open Marketplace V2.0 and share it with your friends and peers without any fear that the links might expire!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Alpha-V2-0-Release---Development-Update/1-xa2xhEhm5nlElJUqyMhEMQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Alpha-V2-0-Release---Development-Update/1-4UH5cHbZBKAPH1DIlBuatw.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s finally here!"}]},{"type":"text","value":" The Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 has just been released on Github and is now available for all to play with."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This version is going to be unlike other testnet versions we’ve seen in the recent past.

This exile away from Slack was due to\nthe overwhelming amount of spam we used to receive on the platform, and since\nthat time, the community has been split in between using Telegram, Discord, and\nRiot — with our trusty bot “Rutherford” connecting all of the conversations\ntogether in real time.\n\nWhile it is accommodating, this setup isn’t ideal and it also carries its load\nof pickles. For one, it makes spam more time-consuming to deal with, each spam\npost is required to be deleted on all three platforms. It also makes\ninteractions and communications less interesting due to how posts from other\nplatforms are displayed and formatted. Then there’s the issue of always being\nrequired to maintain the Rutherford bot which tends to break from time to time.\n\nOn top of this, and perhaps more importantly, there’s the inconvenience where we\ncan’t really make the chatrooms as awesome as they could be by using bots since\neveryone’s on different platforms; bots sometimes don’t communicate or simply\ncannot interact, by nature, with users on different platforms.\n\nFor these and other reasons, we’ve made the decision to officially move over to\nDiscord and methodically reduce resources on Riot and Telegram slowly over time. \nIn 7 days, starting from today, the Telegram channels will be put in read-only\nmode. This should incentivize the remaining Telegram users to move over while\nstill allowing new Telegram users to discover the project and read the\nconversations.\n\nParticl - Discord Me [https://discord.me/particl]\nOfficial server for the Particl project. Particl is a blockchain project\nbuilding a new independent and decentralized… [https://discord.me/particl]\ndiscord.me [https://discord.me/particl]\n\nWhat Will Improve?\nThe time is right to move exclusively to Discord. With the release of the Open\nMarketplace being imminent, we anticipate an uptick in new users joining our\nawesome community. Serving new users on one platform instead of many will make\neveryone’s user experience much better and will allow us to do much more. Here’s\na quick list of what the move to Discord will look like and — more\nimportantly — what opportunities it opens up. Note that this list is obviously\nnot complete, and new stuff will be added as we march forward.\n\nBetter User Experience\nThis is probably the most obvious benefit we’ll get from moving exclusively to\none platform. Interacting on many different platforms at the same time\ndefinitely reduces the user experience by making much less appealing and,\nfrankly, more confusing — especially to newcomers coming into our community and\nnot being used to see bots responding instead of real people.\n\nLet’s face it, linking platforms has many downsides. Bot conversations are\nconfusing chains of replies to users on different platforms, images struggle\nuploading properly everywhere at the same time. The various different Particl\nchannels, each with their unique URL and mixed between other crypto channels on\nTelegram is also pretty chaotic.\n\nDiscord will fix all of the above by providing a clean and structured interface\nthat will go a long way in enhancing the quality of interactions and make\neverything more fun and intuitive.\n\nFight Off Spammers\nSpam on Telegram is off the rails!\n\nEvery day, we see fake accounts joining the many channels and spamming them with\nseriously questionable content or “business proposals”. And it’s not like we\ndon’t fight back. Even though our Telegram channels have three different bots\nspecifically dedicated to filtering these kinds of unwanted posts, spam still\nhappens at a pretty regular rate.\n\nDiscord simply offers more tools and ways to fight off spam and oddly seems to\nhave fewer spammers going around from server to server with the hopes of\ndeceiving users or just ruin their experience. We’ve also heard very positive\nand unanimous feedback from the people from other communities we’ve talked to\nthat have made “the move” from Telegram to Discord as well: moving over to\nDiscord has significantly reduced spam and increased community engagement and\nparticipation rates.\n\nBetter Ways to Keep Up-To-Date\nAnother neat benefit the community will gain from being united under the same\nplatform is the ability to quickly stay up-to-date with the project and get\nadditional information and content. Because it is very easy to add and find (as\na user) new channels, we’ll be capitalizing on that to keep you all in the loop.\n\nDon’t have Twitter? Can’t be bothered looking around for updates? Forgot to put\nParticl’s next event in your calendar? Well, it doesn’t matter anymore, because\nwe’ve got your back!\n\nIn fact, we’ve already created a few channels specifically dedicated to making\nyour life easier. To be more precise, we’ve created a whole section dedicated to\nmaking project information and updates as accessible as it’s ever been! This\nsection contains these sub-channels:\n\n * #announcements: Get all the latest news about Particl. This is usually what\n   goes on particl.news.\n * #progress-updates: This sub-channel contains all the development updates and\n   general information about the progress being made on the project. This is\n   where you’ll find Status Reports, notable Github updates, development\n   updates, and etc.\n * #tweets: This section automatically shows all the tweets made from the\n   official @ParticlProject Twitter account. It doesn’t matter if you have a\n   Twitter account or not, you should still be able to easily get access to our\n   tweets if you so desire!\n * #team: Here you will get the chance to learn a bit more about the Particl\n   team members by reading various bios and information tidbits about them.\n * #graphics: There’s a lot of Particl-related graphics, but somehow they’ve\n   always been hard to get a hold of. Not anymore! This sub-channel contains all\n   the latest important graphics. If you are looking for a specific graphic in\n   particular, well then you now know where to-3.24% go look for it!\n * #events: This is like your very own Particl calendar. This sub-channel will\n   remind you of any Particl-related event 30, 7, and 1 day before they happen.\n   This includes conferences, community gatherings, hardforks, release dates,\n   and etc. Never miss an event anymore!\n * #youtube: This one is self-explanatory. Just like #tweets, this sub-channel\n   will automatically post the latest videos published on Particl’s Youtube\n   account.\n\nAs time goes by, and as we receive feedback and suggestions, new sub-channels\nwill be added to make the Particl Discord server the ultimate platform to be on\nto not miss anything.\n\nGot Some Spare Change?\nWe will shortly introduce on Discord an open-source tipping bot that will allow\nyou to securely send PART tips to other people directly from Discord. This\nshould make newcomers warmer and more engaged to our community and encourage\npeople who receive tips to pay it forward, strengthening the bond between us\nall!\n\nAutomation Make Everything Easier and More Fun\nAutomation and bots on Discord are the bomb! They are much more flexible than on\nTelegram, opening up more opportunities. They allow polls, custom commands,\nauto-moderation, music streaming, tags, auto-responders, and much more. This\nwill allow for many more interactions and much more fun and will help make\nParticl’s Discord our very own world.\n\nWhile we had bots on Telegram and Discord before, we couldn’t really use them to\ntheir full extent as they lose their effectiveness when users are spread across\nvarious different platforms. They obviously cannot interact with users on other\nplatforms, so we couldn’t make use of their more exciting, fun, and engaging\ncapabilities. This is poised to change now!\n\nA Better Structure for Community Involvement\nWe’re also currently working on setting up a better structure for the onboarding\nof community members who want to take a more active role in contributing to the\nproject. As can be easily observed, staying organized when only using a chat\nplatform can be quite difficult if you do not use any sort of task management\nplatform.\n\nUsing automation, we are in the process of linking a Trello board to a\ncontributor’s channel to make it easy and accessible to manage tasks. Once\nready, contributors will be able to interact with the Trello board directly from\nthe channel and collaborate with fellow community members up for the task. This\ncontributor channel should be ready in a couple of days and will be an\ninvite-only channel, so don’t hesitate to contact @CryptoGuard#3505 on Discord\nso that he can add you to the channel!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Will Become of Rutherford?\nRutherford BotRutherford is the bot that’s been linking all of Particl’s chat\nplatforms together. To incentivize people to move over to Discord, we will\ndeactivate it on Telegram and put the platform in a read-only mode in just 7\ndays, meaning you will be able to read what people say on Discord, but won’t be\nable to post messages.\n\nWhat About Riot?\nRiot is a different beast and will get a different treatment with this move to\nDiscord, at least in the beginning. It doesn’t attract spammers, is relatively\nsecure by allowing end-to-end encryption, and is where most of our developers\nhang around. For these reasons, we will keep Riot and Discord connected for the\nmoment and will see how it plays out. Due to the low number of community members\non Riot, this shouldn’t impact the user experience too much. Still, we recommend\nusers looking for a more interactive experience to move over to Discord.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOfficially moving to Discord has been something we’ve been looking into doing\nfor quite some time now, and with the marketplace looming and the potential\nuptick in new users it may bring, it only seems logical to make this move now.\nWe are extremely excited by the new possibilities having our entire community\ngathered within the same platform opens up, and we fully intend on making the\nbest out of this situation to enhance your community experience.\n\nSo come to join us today on Discord [https://discord.me/particl] and let the fun\nbegin!\n\nThe Particl team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-is-Officially-Moving-to-Discord/1-rjpXh09SzFLlD51LJyr-4Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"better-community-support-more-fun\">Better Community Support &amp; More Fun</h3><p>The Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever since we abandoned Slack more than a year ago.

With the release of the Open Marketplace being imminent, we anticipate an uptick in new users joining our awesome community. Serving new users on one platform instead of many will make everyone’s user experience much better and will allow us to do much more. Here’s a quick list of what the move to Discord will look like and — more importantly — what opportunities it opens up. Note that this list is obviously not complete, and new stuff will be added as we march forward.</p><h3 id=\"better-user-experience\">Better User Experience</h3><p>This is probably the most obvious benefit we’ll get from moving exclusively to one platform. Interacting on many different platforms at the same time definitely reduces the user experience by making much less appealing and, frankly, more confusing — especially to newcomers coming into our community and not being used to see bots responding instead of real people.</p><p>Let’s face it, linking platforms has many downsides. Bot conversations are confusing chains of replies to users on different platforms, images struggle uploading properly everywhere at the same time.

Even though our Telegram channels have three different bots specifically dedicated to filtering these kinds of unwanted posts, spam still happens at a pretty regular rate.</p><p>Discord simply offers more tools and ways to fight off spam and oddly seems to have fewer spammers going around from server to server with the hopes of deceiving users or just ruin their experience. We’ve also heard very positive and unanimous feedback from the people from other communities we’ve talked to that have made “the move” from Telegram to Discord as well: moving over to Discord has significantly reduced spam and increased community engagement and participation rates.</p><h3 id=\"better-ways-to-keep-up-to-date\">Better Ways to Keep Up-To-Date</h3><p>Another neat benefit the community will gain from being united under the same platform is the ability to quickly stay up-to-date with the project and get additional information and content.

This hardfork will port two testnet features onto mainnet: multi-signature\ncold staking and paid SMSG. Because hardforks are a pretty big deal, it is\nimportant for you to prepare your nodes in prevision of this event so that you\nare not left staking on a deprecated chain. Luckily, the whole preparation\nprocess is extremely easy.\n\nDevelopment Update - Planned Hardfork Schedule - Particl News\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n2019.02.16-12:00:00 UTC In 4 days, on the 16th of February, we're going to fork\nParticl's test network (testnet) to…\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Prepare\nThe only thing you need to make sure is that the nodes you are running are\nupdated to Particl Core 0.17.1.3, or, at the very least, Particl Core 0.17.1.2. \nAny version prior to this one will not be compatible with the hardforked chain\nand will therefore make you stake on the wrong chain. This will make all of your\nstaking rewards invalid and any transaction made on that wrong chain will not be\nreflected on the hardforked chain. In other words, you absolutely need to update\nyour node before the hardfork if you wish to use PART post-hardfork.\n\nHere’s how to do it, depending on the client you use.\n\nParticl Desktop | Particl Qt/cli | Partyman | Cold Staking Pool | Particl Copay \n| On Exchange\n\nI. Particl Desktop\nIf you’re using Particl Desktop, then lucky you, because it is the easiest of\nall clients to update. Running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and beyond means your\nwallet will automatically notify you as soon as there’s a new Particl Core\nversion available. All you have to do after getting this notification is close\nyour Particl Desktop wallet and reopen it. Your Particl Core daemon should\nautomatically update upon reopening the client.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, even if you are running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and\nbeyond, it is recommended to manually check if the wallet has properly updated.\nThere shouldn’t be any issue, but you can never be too careful when a hardforks\ncoming.\n\n.Additionally, if you are running a Particl Desktop version older than 1.3.1,\nthen we highly recommend, as always, upgrading to the latest version\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb] as it fixes\nvarious issues, bugs, and contains many improvements.\n\nDownload Particl Desktop 1.3.1: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1\n\nParticl Desktop 1.3.1 Announcement & Changelog: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\n\nII. Particl-Qt & Particl-cli\nIf you’re running either Particl-Qt or Particl-cli, then you will need to\nmanually download and install the latest version of Particl Core. Simply visit\nthe Particl-Core Github release page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/] and download the latest\nversion.\n\nNote: The latest Particl Core version is 0.17.1.3, not 0.17.1.2. However, as\nlong as you run a Particl Core version that is equal or more recent than\n0.17.1.2, you will have no issue with the hardfork. Particl Core 0.17.1.2 is the\nMINIMUM version required for your to follow along with the network’s hardfork.\n\nDownload Particl Core 0.17.1.3: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\n\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree.

Partyman (Cold Staking App)\nIf you are using Partyman to cold stake your funds, then whenever you enter a\ncommand within the app, it should automatically prompt you to install the newest\nversion. In order to properly update your node, you will first need to upgrade\nyour Partyman app, then update your Core. In order to do this, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Go into your Partyman folder (cd /root/partyman)\n * Type the command git pull. This will update the Partyman app.\n * Once done, update Particl Core by typing./partyman update\n * Accept the update by typing y\n * Once updated, restart your Particl Core by typing./partyman restart\n * Accept the restart by typing y\n\nIV. Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are cold staking from a pool, you don’t need to do anything other than\nupdate whatever wallet you use to access your funds. Usually, this would be\nParticl-Qt or Particl Desktop. Refer to the instructions above to properly\nupdate.\n\nIf you are a pool operator, you will need to update both the Particl Core and\nthe packages of your pool. Follow these steps:\n\n * First update your pool’s packages: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_old_install_to_package.txt\n * Then, update your Particl Core: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.txt\n\nV. Particl Copay Wallet\nIf you are using Particl’s mobile application, Particl Copay, then you don’t\nneed to do anything. The nodes Particl Copay connects to will automatically\nupdate in time for the hardfork.\n\nVI. Coins on Exchange\nIf your coins are stored on an exchange, then you don’t need to do anything. The\nexchange will update its nodes in time for the hardfork. Exchanges and other\nthird-parties running Particl nodes have already been made aware of the upcoming\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be equipped to navigate any standard\nissue during or after the hardfork. If you have any question, don’t hesitate to \njoin our Discord [https://discord.gg/YFeXbFZ] server and ask your questions in\nthe #support channel. We’ll be happy to help you out!\n\nIn the meantime, we can’t wait to go through this hardfork and add to Particl’s\nnetwork these two awesome features!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/March-1st-Hardfork---How-to-Prepare/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As many of you know, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0\"><strong>PART mainnet network is going to undergo a hardfork on the 1st of March 2019</strong></a>.

During this time, the team and community\ntesters have been hard at work identifying & fixing the last of the small issues\nstill present in the latest testnet builds.\n\nWith a stable build nearing completion, it is imperative to prepare our main\nParticl Network blockchain for the addition of a privacy-focused decentralized\nmarketplace. The first step is a code update that will allow decentralized\ngovernance to work properly (with coin weight) and requires hardfork. Ahead of\nthis, and a non-event for most users, will be a hardfork of our Particl test\nnetwork as well.\n\nHere are the things you need to know.\n\nPlanned Hardfork Schedule\nTestnet Fork (Particl Core 0.18)\n⭐️ 2019.02.16 —12:00:00 UTC\n\n * VARIABLE SMSG FEE\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n * BULLETPROOFS\n\nMainnet Fork (Particl Core 0.17)\n⭐️ 2019.03.01 —12:00:00 UTC\n\n * PAID SMSG\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTestnet Hardfork (16th of February)\n> 2019.02.16–12:00:00 UTC\nIn 4 days, on the 16th of February, we’re going to fork Particl’s test network\n(testnet) to merge a couple of features that have been sitting in RegTest\n(internal pre-testnet network) for some time now. This hardfork doesn’t require\nyou to do anything but, of course, it will allow you to test these new features\non our public testnet.\n\nBulletproofs\nThis testnet hardfork is going to include Bulletproofs, the Confidential\nTransactions protocol improvement that will reduce the size of CT/RingCT\ntransactions by ~70%. Bulletproofs is an important brick in Particl’s wall of\nprivacy as it will allow RingCT and CT transactions to be executed without\nbloating the blockchain and bringing its size to absurd levels. We believe\nprivacy and scalability can and should go hand in hand.\n\nWhy make compromises when you can have the best of both worlds?\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nAs some of you already know, we are already working on a major new feature to\nour mobile app, Particl Copay; Cold staking capabilities! This testnet hardfork\nwill add multi-signature cold staking support, meaning it will now be possible\nto cold stake funds held collectively by multiple devices.\n\nThis will give you access to the utmost level of privacy Proof-of-Stake can\noffer.\n\nIn fact, cold staking from multi-signature addresses means you will need to have\naccess to more than one device to move funds around. This constitutes a solid\nbarrier to anyone looking into stealing your coins as they would be required to\nget a hold of all of your signing devices.\n\n> Note: Ledger Nano devices won’t initially be compatible with multi-signature\ncold staking, however we’ve already identified that, and with the help of a\ncustom script, it could be possible to make the hardware devices compatible.\nThis may not come immediately, but is good to know for future endeavors!\nVariable SMSG Fee\nThis feature is probably not an exciting one at first sight but will be very\nimportant when it comes to implementing advanced escrow features. This protocol\nimprovement allows SMSG messages to have various fees, allowing, for example,\ncustom escrow security deposit ratios (agree with the other party to put any %\nof the item’s value as security deposit instead of 100% every time). You won’t\nreally be able to test variable SMSG in a practical way until this feature is\nintegrated into the escrow system. But, it’s nonetheless an important feature\nmaking its way onto testnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainnet Hardfork\n> 2019.03.01–12:00:00 UTC\nIn order for the Open Marketplace to go live a couple things need to happen; the\ntrustless escrow system needs to be adapted to our OMP-library for blinded\nescrow (privacy), and Paid SMSG needs to be onboarded to mainnet. The latter\nrequires a planned hardfork which will happen on March 1st 2019, at 12:00 am GMT\n.\n\nHardforking is a pretty big deal, especially as it requires the greater majority\nof nodes to update in a timely manner. This requirement also applies to\nthird-parties and exchanges to ensure that they do not run an outdated fork of\nthe project. For this reason, we’ve already started contacting third-parties\nlast week to let them know the improvements coming to the Particl Network and be\nleaders in the shift to the new chain.\n\n> Note: for users of Particl Desktop and Particl Copay mobile apps, the clients\nwill automatically upgrade and sync with the correct chain seamlessly in the\nbackground. For most users both planned hardforks will be non-events but we\nwanted to responsibly let you know what is coming on March 1st.\nPaid SMSG Messages\nThis feature is necessary in order for the governance system to function\nproperly on mainnet. This is the missing piece that needs to be added onto\nmainnet (it already works flawlessly on testnet) so that governance votes (both\nproposals and listing flags) can be properly registered with coin weight.\n\nWe cannot release the marketplace on mainnet without this critical feature.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nAs mentioned above, we’ll be hardforking multi-signature cold staking\ncapabilities onto testnet on the 16th of February. This will give 2 weeks for\ntesting properly this protocol enhancement after which we’ll merge onto mainnet\nat the same time as the paid SMSG message hardfork. This should reduce the risks\nassociated with executing hardforks by combining both these items into the same\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’d also like to thank everybody that has helped us test the latest testnet\nversion of the marketplace. We are still working on preparing the groundwork for\nthe Open Marketplace’s mainnet launch, and wanted to relay parts of the critical\npath in an easy, step-by-step manner so everyone on the same page.\n\nIn the meantime, you can relax and watch our latest AMA/FAQ Session\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoB1_rNWvEM], Paul’s latest interview with\nCryptoTradingFR (part 1 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN1bEatbNrQ], part 2\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI-lG14WktE&t=1s]), or just launch and play\nwith the latest testnet builds\n[https://particl.news/new-open-marketplace-testnet-builds-a45fbc699fc5] of\nParticl’s Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update---Planned-Hardfork-Schedule/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"preparing-mainnet-for-a-private-decentralized-marketplace\">Preparing Mainnet for a Private, Decentralized Marketplace</h3><p>Over the past few weeks we’ve started preparing the groundwork for Particl’s Open Marketplace first mainnet release.

No new features is currently\nbeing implemented until the Alpha build is made entirely stable. Having a super\nstable build will make integrating new features on it much faster and easier and\nshould lead to more regular (and exciting) releases.\n\nThe Alpha Version Moves Up to Mainnet\nOnce the testnet Alpha version of the marketplace is fully stable and thoroughly\ntested, it will be moved up onto Particl’s mainnet, allowing you to purchase and\nsell real items using real PART coins. This milestone event will mark the end of\nthe Alpha phase of development and initiate the Beta phase.\n\nLimited Features\nThis first ever mainnet version of Particl’s Open Marketplace won’t require any\nsort of hardfork and will only contain a limited set of features. The features\navailable will be the same features that have been on testnet for some time.\nThis includes decentralized governance with coin weight, as well as the complete\nbuy and sell flow. Community proposals, although not directly a marketplace\nfeature, will also be live on mainnet.\n\nNo Privacy Enhancing Features in This Version\nIt’s very important to note that this mainnet version won’t be coupled with the\nRingCT hardfork yet, meaning that the MAD escrow system won’t be enhanced with\nit. This means that all marketplace transactions made on this version of the\nmarketplace will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is hardforked onto\nmainnet and integrated into the escrow system during Beta. You can rest assured,\nhowever, that no other data will be generated by the marketplace.\n\nThe Beta Phase Will be Focused on Adding New Features\nNew features will be introduced during the Beta phase and will be integrated\ninto existing testing builds as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nRelease Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of\nfeatures are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused on building the base layer for the marketplace, Beta\nwill be focused on integrating new features. A fully stable marketplace codebase\nwill result in quicker releases with something new to show for almost everytime,\nand it should also be a much more exciting phase for everyone than Alpha.\n\nBeta Starts as Soon as Alpha Ends\nThe Beta phase of development will start immediately after the Alpha phase is\ncompleted and moved onto mainnet. The next build that will follow the first\nmainnet version of the Open Marketplace will be a Beta build and will be\nreleased, like Alpha was up until the end, on testnet.\n\nTwo Development Branches Used During Beta\nDuring Beta, two types of branches, Development and Stable, will be used to push\ntestnet builds to the community.\n\nDevelopment Branch\n\nThe Development branch will be the first place where new features will be\navailable for community testing. Because introducing new features almost\ninevitably introduces bugs and issues, this may mean the Development branch\nmight not be super stable all the time. This is not ideal to get a good number\nof testers (if it’s broken all the time, people are less interested in testing\nthe builds) and to show friends. After all, what’s worse than showing a friend a\nbuild of Particl’s Open Marketplace only for it to crash in your face).\n\nStable Branch\n\nThis is where the Stable branch comes in. This branch will be used to push\nfeatures that have already went through a good number of tests and that have\nbeen fixed of most bugs and issues. While the Stable branch is still a testnet\nbranch, it will make builds much more stable and easy to share with friends.\nThis branch is the final step before a feature is introduced onto mainnet.\n\nA Feature’s Path to Mainnet\nWith this new strategy, a feature now has to go through one additional hoop\nbefore being implemented on mainnet. It first needs to be tested internally by\nthe team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of\nmost of its bugs and issues, the feature gets implemented onto the Stable branch\nfor its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be\nintegrated onto mainnet.\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nThis mainnet release marks an important milestone for Particl. It separates it\nfrom the group forming the majority of blockchain projects that do not have any\nsort of product ready at this time and gives it an entry ticket into a much more\nlimited category of projects that have a product live on mainnet. What’s more,\nit will signify the beginning of a brand new phase for the project and the\ncommunity as it will now be easier than ever to spend cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

To make all of this a reality, the Particl developers have been\nproducing a lot of high-quality code, earning the team a spot within the top\ntiers of several Github audit reports/reviews\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAll of these achievements are surely impressive, especially coming from a team\nthat’s relatively quite small compared to other projects producing similar\namount [http://coincodecap.com] and quality of code (a look at the contributors\nsection of this code quality ranking [http://coincodecap.com] tells everything\nyou need to know). But what this story fails to mention is that none of the\naccomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the\nproject, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product. In\nfact, all of them exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the security,\nprivacy, stability, and scalability of the network in prevision for the mainnet\nrelease of Particl’s first application: the Open Marketplace.\n\nThe Open Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is a product that’s been in the making for quite some time\nand has proven to be a huge undertaking due to its extremely ambitious nature.\n\nIn short, it is an entirely trustless marketplace with full privacy baked in by\ndefault and with almost no fee at all. The fact that it is trustless means that\nit can function autonomously and without any third-party having to get involved\nat any point in time. This allows fees to be brought down to the bare minimum\nand completely eliminates the trust factor involved when making online sales and\npurchases.\n\nIts privacy aspect, which probably is the most groundbreaking aspect of the Open\nMarketplace, makes it so that all purchases and sales you make are verifiably\nprivate/anonymous. Whatever you do within the platform generates no identifiable\ndata at all, meaning that it can’t be harvested by Particl or any other\nthird-party other than the one you are transacting with. In other words, nothing\nyou do on Particl’s Open Marketplace can leave any trace behind.\n\nThis privacy aspect truly is a revolution within the eCommerce industry, an\nindustry that has made its fortune preying on its own users by collecting their\ndata, without their consent, in order to get profits and influence.\n\nThe simple fact that no other project has ever attempted to build a completely\ntrustless marketplace with rock solid privacy built directly at its core speaks\nabout the complexity of the task. Being the first at doing something also means\nvery few examples and proofs-of-concept are out there to help pave the way\nforward, but it also means that you can create a niche audience around your “new\nway” and capitalize on it!\n\nEven though a lot of development progress has been made to the Open Marketplace\nin 2018, the fact it has only been operable on testnet for the entire year has\nmade people more eager than ever to see some kind of mainnet release and finally\nget their hands on a working version of this groundbreaking technology.\n\nMainnet is Finally Upon Us!\nThe days where the Open Marketplace is only available as a testnet product are\ncoming to an end. We’ve stated in the past we wanted this year to be different\nin nature from the previous one, and so let’s start it with a bang! Whereas 2018\nwas solely focused on development, 2019 will see much more action with the\nrelease of the Open Marketplace on mainnet. The best part? The mainnet release\nof the Alpha version of Particl’s Open Marketplace is now imminent!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Timeline\nAs stated in an answer\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-1-fe6a3f3014c2#3a6d] to a\nquestion asked during our latest AMA/FAQ session, one of the decisions the\nParticl team has taken in South Africa has been to focus on making the current\nAlpha version of the marketplace completely stable and move it onto mainnet as\nsoon as that stability is reached. In other words, in just a short time, it will\nfinally be possible to buy and sell real goods and services on Particl’s Open\nMarketplace and do it with real coins!\n\nAlpha Development Phase Ends and Releases on Mainnet\nThe current Alpha version contains all the necessary tools for basic eCommerce\nto be possible, including weighted decentralized governance to keep it clean\n(which is currently available internally, but is not merged on public testnet\njust yet). Once Alpha is successfully moved onto mainnet, it will mark the end\nof the Alpha period for the Open Marketplace and the beginning of the Beta\nphase.\n\nAlpha Mainnet Features\nIf you’ve played with recent versions of the marketplace on testnet, then you\nwill find yourself within a familiar environment when running it on mainnet. All\nof the features introduced throughout the year on testnet will now be available,\nand very stable, within a real-life environment. There is no better way to test\nfeatures, especially those relying on game-theory such as the MAD escrow and the\ndecentralized governance mechanism, than to put them into the wild where real\nfunds and incentives are involved.\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that, as the current switch from testnet\nto mainnet won’t require any sort of hardfork, the first mainnet version of the\nOpen Marketplace won’t process transactions using Particl’s RingCT protocol \nwhich will stay on testnet for the time being. What this means is that \nmarketplace transactions will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is\nfully implemented into the escrow system at some point in time during Beta’s\ndevelopment phase.\n\nThe mainnet version of the Open Marketplace Alpha will contain these features:\n\n * Buy and sell real products and services with real coins\n * Trustless and fee-less escrow mechanism without RingCT privacy\n * Decentralized governance mechanism to flag listings\n * Community proposals\n\nBeta Development Phase Begins Soon (Testnet)\nWhile the Alpha mainnet version of the marketplace will allow anyone in the\nworld to buy and sell real goods and services using real coins, it will only\ninclude the basic functions that make eCommerce possible. The Beta phase of\ndevelopment, which will run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version, is aimed at\nbuilding the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce\nexperience and slowly integrating them as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nThis phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for\nthe marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features. For this reason,\nBeta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact\nthat every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of\nthe features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta\nphase:\n\n * Inventory management\n * Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)\n * Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging\n   will likely be integrated in more than one way)\n * Private markets (or “Bubbles)\n * Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)\n * Escrow recovery and refunds\n * A section for wanted items\n * Shipping carrier integration\n * …and more (click here)!\n   [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a]\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n> Note: The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon\nas the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each\nnew Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release\nCandidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features\nare not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\nBranching Off\nAs discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see\nits development be split into two branches: the Development branch, and the\nStable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will\nmake testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds\neasier to share with friends.\n\nThe Development branch will be where all the newly introduced features first get\nadded. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues,\nthis simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super\nstable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but\nis necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly\nby the more advanced types of user.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, a new branch, the Stable branch, will be introduced\nwhere only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to\nhave a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also\nhave all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features\nthat will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed\nthrough the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much\nmore enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing\nwith other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).\n\nIn simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it\nwill first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the\nrougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the\nfeature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of\ntesting. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto\nmainnet and able to be used with real funds.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nIt would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace\non mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project\nand the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by\neveryone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the\neCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data\nand shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to\noffer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless,\nprivate-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can\nparticipate.\n\nWhat’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to\nspend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire\ncryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No\nmore will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to\nbuy stuff with crypto.\n\nThis release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of\nblockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at\nthis time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group\nof projects that have a product live on mainnet!\n\nWhile this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the\nfirst full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably\nfunctioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real\ncrypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the\nproject on all angles.\n\nWe cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you\nand watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

But what this story fails to mention is that none of the accomplishments mentioned above actually are the main goal or product of the project, they are merely put in place to support the project’s main product.

The Beta phase of development, which will <strong>run parallel to the mainnet Alpha version</strong>, is aimed at building the additional features required for a more accessible eCommerce experience and slowly integrating them as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate\"><strong>Release Candidates</strong></a>. This phase will start as soon as Alpha hits mainnet!</p><p><strong>Whereas Alpha was focused mainly on building the base layer and functions for the marketplace, Beta will be focused on adding new features.</strong> For this reason, Beta is likely to be a more exciting phase than Alpha was simply due to the fact that every new build will most likely introduce a new feature. Here are some of the features currently being considered or already being worked on for the Beta phase:</p><ul><li>Inventory management</li><li>Privacy (RingCT implemented onto the MAD escrow system)</li><li>Messaging mechanisms (various implementations being looked into, messaging will likely be integrated in more than one way)</li><li>Private markets (or “Bubbles)</li><li>Payment gateways (pay with your favorite currency)</li><li>Escrow recovery and refunds</li><li>A section for wanted items</li><li>Shipping carrier integration</li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11#b76a\"><strong>…and more (click here)!</strong></a></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The Beta phase of development for the Open Marketplace will begin as soon as the Alpha build is made entirely stable and ported over to the mainnet. Each new Beta feature will be introduced as a Release Candidate (RC). Release Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of features are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"branching-off\">Branching Off</h3><p>As discussed during the team’s series of meetings in South Africa, Beta will see its development be <strong>split into two branches</strong>: the Development branch, and the Stable branch. This is a different release strategy than Alpha’s, and it will make testing Beta versions much more convenient for most people and make builds easier to share with friends.</p><p>The <strong>Development branch</strong> will be where all the newly introduced features first get added. Because adding new features almost always introduces new bugs and issues, this simple fact of adding new functions can break builds that used to be super stable and make them unusable. This is not very good for community testing but is necessary when building stuff, and so this branch is likely to be used mainly by the more advanced types of user.</p><p>For the sake of convenience, a new branch, the <strong>Stable branch</strong>, will be introduced where only stable features will be included. The goal of the Stable branch is to have a stable enough testing environment to both show off to people and to also have all of its features be tested by a larger pool of testers. The features that will be added to this branch will be those that have successfully passed through the Development branch tests. This should make community testing much more enjoyable, and builds from the Stable branch should be better for sharing with other people (they won’t expire and shouldn’t break unexpectedly).</p><p>In simpler terms, it means that for a feature to be implemented on mainnet, it will first need to be tested internally by the team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of most of its bugs and issues, the feature will get implemented onto the Stable branch for its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be integrated onto mainnet and able to be used with real funds.</p><hr><h2 id=\"biggest-milestone-to-date\">Biggest Milestone to Date</h2><p>It would be an understatement to say the release of Particl’s Open Marketplace on mainnet, even if just the Alpha version, is a big milestone for the project and the community. Not only has this initial release been long-awaited by everyone, but it’s also setting the stage for Particl’s future disruption of the eCommerce industry by finally allowing users to be in full control of their data and shopping experience. Remember, no company or organization has ever tried to offer what Particl Open Marketplace stands for: a completely trustless, private-by-default, and almost fee-less marketplace where everyone can participate.</p><p>What’s more, it will finally make cryptocurrencies as easy and affordable to spend as ever, and once a Bitcoin gateway is integrated, will benefit the entire cryptocurrency economy to truly separate itself from the global fiat economy. No more will you be required to “cash out” your coins and pay useless fees just to buy stuff with crypto.</p><p>This release also separates Particl from the group forming the majority of blockchain projects: those who do not have any sort of mainnet product ready at this time. In fact, with this release, Particl enters a much more limited group of projects that have a product live on mainnet!</p><p>While this coming mainnet release obviously doesn’t live up to par with what the first full version of the marketplace (post-Beta) will offer, it is a provably functioning proof-of-concept that allows you to buy and sell real stuff for real crypto, and we strongly believe porting it onto mainnet will greatly help the project on all angles.</p><p>We cannot wait to start this great mainnet journey with every single one of you and watch the Open Marketplace evolve into a behemoth!</p><hr><p>Want to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious eCommerce in general?
