Simply head over to this link and follow the\ninstructions: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking. Note that, while the process\ncan currently only be executed from the Particl-Qt client, an actual Particl\nDesktop integration will be coming at a later time.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are very excited to finally announce that as of today, Ledger has officially\nadded support for Particl on their Ledger Live application and Nano S device.\nThis means PART will now be available for cold storage on Nano S hardware\nwallets with cold staking capabilities enabled. This release marks the first\ntime pure PoS coins stored on a hardware device can be safely staked without any\nintermediary nor internet connection required.\n\nTo learn how to use Particl on the Ledger Nano S, follow this simple tutorial on\nour Wiki page: https://particl.wiki/ledger\n\nThe Most Secure Way to Store PART\nNo matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are,\nyou are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you\neither enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device.\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and\ncyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in\nthe total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.\n\nThe Ledged Nano S hardware deviceThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure\nhardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets:\nprivate keys are stored in a protected area of a micro-controller, and cannot be\ntransferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even\nwhen connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\n\nThe World’s Most Secure PoS Protocol\nA vulnerability often associated with PoS is the risk associated with the\nprocess of staking itself. In fact, Proof-of-Stake protocols usually require\nusers to keep their wallets online and “unlocked for staking”. While wallets in\nthat state are still locked and require a password to execute transactions, this\nvery password is stored in the device’s memory so that it can remain “unlocked\nfor staking”. As we’ve seen with the Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this\nyear\n[https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870]\n, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily\nresult in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.\n\nThis issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold\nstaking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which\ncontain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address,\neven coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets.\nThese staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than\nthe end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what\nthis means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake\nexposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility\nis assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be\nleft unencrypted).\n\nThe Ultimate Vulnerability\nHowever, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl\nstakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected\ncomputers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone\ndoes not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter\nhow secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to\neither spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means\nprivate keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for\na brief moment. With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for\nhackers and cyber thieves\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU]\n, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being\naware of it becomes greater. That is even more true as more and more\nvulnerabilities and exploits surrounding the ME Intel chip keep making headlines\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-me-new-firmware-bugs,37492.html].\n\n> Between all the new Spectre-class CPU flaws and the bugs the company and other\nresearchers keep finding for its Management Engine (ME) firmware, Intel can’t\nseem to catch a break. Now the company has publicly disclosed two more ME bugs,\none of which allows remote code execution on victims’ PCs.\nThe ME Intel chip\n[https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html] is a\nproprietary engine that powers hardware features that operate at the baseboard\nlevel, below the operating system. By enabling interaction with low-level\nhardware, this chip gives administrators (or any user that can find practical\nexploits) the ability to perform tasks that previously required someone to be\nphysically present at the desktop. The EFF itself describes the ME Intel chip\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it] \nas a “largely undocumented master controller for your CPU: it works with system\nfirmware during boot and has direct access to system memory, the screen,\nkeyboard, and network”.\n\nSimply put, transacting any coin, PoS or PoW, is something that is exponentially\nbecoming riskier as hackers get more experience in the crypto industry and\nimprove their techniques.\n\nHardware Cold Staking to the Rescue\nSecure Staking Brings Peace of MindThis is where the significance of this Ledger\nNano S integration comes into play as it is coded in such a way that no private\nkey needs to be exchanged between the Ledger Nano S hardware device and the\nclient (Particl-Qt). This means that users will now be able to store funds\nstored on a hardware device and still delegate the hardware wallet’s staking\npowers to a cold staking node.\n\nThis release, as it currently stands, is the first ever successful mainnet\nrelease of a pure PoS hardware cold staking setup, the ultimate solution for\nusers looking at getting the best level of security, flexibility, and\naccessibility without compromising decentralization. You know, when they say you \n“can’t have your cake and it eat too”, well it turns out with Particl you now\ncan!\n\nSecure Decentralized Voting Process\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThis Ledger Nano S integration currently only\nallow users to securely store and stake their funds offline on a hardware\ndevice, but it will also ultimately let users participate in both governance\nmechanisms available on Particl. Indeed, with a bit of additional work, users\nwill be able to use their coins stored on their hardware device to participate\nin both governance system without ever requiring to expose their private key or\npassword on the computer used to register their vote. This ensures that ALL\nParticl users, even those with the highest security standards, can partake in\nthe decentralized governance of the project and its platform. No voice left\nunheard!\n\nExciting Times Lie Ahead\nThis release marks the start of an exciting period for the Particl project as we\nwill start seeing more and more features hit both the testnet and mainnet\nnetworks. After a year or so of being in a deep development phase, the pieces\nare finally starting to come all together leading up to the release of the\nlong-awaited Particl Marketplace on mainnet.\n\nAs a matter of fact, ever since the team meeting in Prague, the team has adopted\nnew, better development and management processes and methodologies and has never\nbeen as effective as it currently is. That much can be noticed directly on our\nGithub page where activity has been soaring and commits are pouring in. It can\nsafely be stated that the development aspect of the project is currently at its\nbest and has never been as steady and effective as it currently is.\n\nContest\nTo celebrate this new security feature, we would like to give away 5 Ledger Nano\nS hardware devices to our community! As such, we will be making various contests\nwhich are separated among our different platforms:\n\nTwitter: To participate in this Twitter contest, follow the instructions written\nin our contest tweet\n[http://Welcome%20to%20our%20#giveaway%20channel!%20This%20is%20where%20we%20will%20be%20doing%20many%20giveaways%20with%20the%20help%20of%20the%20GiveawayBot%20moving%20forwards.%20Our%20first%20Discord%20giveaway%20is%20about%20the%20Ledger%20Nano%20S,%20and%20we%20will%20be%20giving%20away%20two%20of%20them%20%28brand%20new,%20shipping%20from%20Ledger%20directly%29%20to%20two%20random%20winners.%20To%20participate,%20just%20react%20:tada:%20to%20the%20post%20above.%20%20For%20an%20additional%20chance%20to%20win%20a%20Ledger,%20we%20are%20also%20having%20a%20Twitter%20contest%20where%203%20winners%20will%20be%20randomly%20picked.%20Simply%20follow%20the%20instructions%20written%20in%20this%20tweet:%20https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1026864584777510912] \nand tag your favorite personality within the cryptocurrency community in the\ncomment section of the tweet to give them a head’s up about this news!

As we’ve seen with the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870\">Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this year</a>, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily result in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.</p><p>This issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold staking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which contain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address, even coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets. These staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than the end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what this means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake exposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility is assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be left unencrypted).</p><h3 id=\"the-ultimate-vulnerability\">The Ultimate Vulnerability</h3><p>However, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl stakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected computers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone does not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter how secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to either spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means private keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for a brief moment. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU\">With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for hackers and cyber thieves</a>, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being aware of it becomes greater.

Simply put, this\nmechanism allows anyone to be able to vote or submit up for a vote a formal\nproposal to the Particl community.\n\nNote: The initial version of the governance system will not contain all the\nfeatures and functionalities that are planned for later versions (i.e. voting\nweight). It will, however, be its first “working version” and will contain most\n(or all) of the basic functionalities. The governance mechanisms will, of\ncourse, be a moving target for some time as we experiment with it in real-life\nscenarios.\n\nHow Does it Work?\nCommunity Proposal ScreenAs many of you already know, Particl has had a fully\ndecentralized voting system on our mainnet ever since it launched in July 2017.\nThis feature, however, has always only been available on CLI (non-graphical\nParticl wallet) and is relatively restrictive in nature. For example, using the\n“legacy” voting system of Particl, it was not possible to vote on two proposals\nat the same time. This behavior not being the most scalable for a truly useful\ndecentralized governance system, the team has been actively working on improving\nthis voting mechanism to give it more flexibility and accessibility.\n\nThe first improvement was to implement it into Particl Desktop, the main wallet\nfor the Particl network. Because Particl-cli isn’t really used by most people\noutside of staking — and more importantly, because users are more likely to use\na simple, well-designed interface to provide them a voice on the network — it\nwas really important to port this feature over our main client.\n\nDecentralized Voting ScreenOnce implemented, it will be possible to go through\nthe entire proposal process directly from Particl Desktop. Indeed, users will be\nable to both create a proposal from scratch and submit it to the community for a\nvoting round. Any Particl user will then be able to navigate to their voting\nscreen and vote on any ongoing proposal. To vote, users do not need to be\nstaking anymore, and weight will ultimately be based on coin weight rather than\nstaking weight. This decision has been made in order to increase the governance\ntool’s accessibility and speed at which consensuses can be reached.\n\nIn fact, users that own fewer amounts of coins are less likely to put up their\ncoins for staking, yet they ideally still need to have a way to express their\nvoice so that the governance system can truly be considered democratic and\ndecentralized. There are many other reasons users would not want to put their\ncoins up for staking, yet when the project governance tool releases on mainnet,\nthey will still be able to partake in the project’s decentralized governance\nprocess they have a stake in.\n\nTallying the number of coins instead of the staking weights is also a much more\naccurate and quick measurement. Indeed, Proof-of-Stake relies partly on luck,\nsimilarly to PoW mining, which is democratically not ideal for obvious reasons;\naccurate results are more interesting than results partly defined by luck. This\nnew governance system mostly requires users to sign a message proving they own\nthe number of coins that they do and that they are voting from their outputs.\nDon’t worry, this all happens automatically under the hood while the entire\ngovernance process is displayed in a user-friendly fashion on Particl Desktop.\nTallying coins instead of staking weights also allows the mechanism to find\nconsensuses more rapidly in certain situations, a feat that is definitely useful\nas that same mechanism is also the basis for the marketplace governance system\nwhere undesirable content needs to be taken out as quickly as possible.\n\nVotes are tallied every time a user votes, which means that as you move your\ncoins around, so do your votes as well. It is thus possible to easily change\nyour vote if you move your coins before a voting round completes.\n\nCold Voting\nThe project governance mechanism is also built with hardware compatibility in\nmind. In fact, as stated in yesterday’s announcement of the integration of\nParticl on the Ledger Nano S\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae],\nusers will eventually be able to “cold vote” using their Ledger Nano S hardware\ndevice directly from the Particl Desktop client. This is probably not a feature\nthat will be available out of the box once the project governance system hits\nmainnet as it still requires a bit of work on our end, but it will ultimately be\navailable at some point in the future. This is directly related to our\ncommitment to develop and make available the most secure blockchain solutions in\nthe industry. To understand the significance of cold voting vs regular,\nespecially as it relates to security, read our Hardware Cold Staking\nannouncement here\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\n\nCommunity Initiative Fund\nBack when Particl users were asked to generate their keys and prepare for the\nParticl genesis block, an initiative has been proposed by the community to\ncompensate SDC coin holders who had failed to swap their coins within the given\nswap timeframe. As such, the community donated an impressive amount of over \n156,000 PART\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm] \nto be paid to the late swappers. Since the clemency period was set up to last\nup\nuntil the last day of 2017\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it wasn’t\npossible at the time to know how many late swappers would claim their PART\ncoins, thus making the donation target a blind one. For this reason, Particl\nusers ended up donating an excess amount of coins to the Community Initiative\nFund. This address contains, without any late swapping claims being accepted\nanymore, a final total amount of 33,817.64 PART.\n\nThe Community in Control\nThe Community Initiative Fund is a donation address owned by the Particl\ncommunity itself. In fact, since its funds originate from community donations,\nneither the Particl Foundation nor the Particl team can move them around without\nany form of community consensus first.\n\nTo facilitate debates around proposed solutions, ideas, and proposals made on\nhow to best use these funds, we’ve announced\n[https://particl.news/building-a-framework-for-community-contribution-e056c04c9c09] \nand created back in January a Kialo discussion thread\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e].\nKialo is a good debate platform where users can form arguments and\ncounter-arguments in a structured and easy-to-follow fashion.\n\nAs we are nearing the testnet and mainnet implementations of the project\ngovernance system on Particl Desktop, there has never been a better time to put\ndown on paper and on Kialo any proposal idea you have been thinking about. The\nbest way to get your proposal accepted by the community is to create excitement\nleading up to the voting round, therefore initiating discussions around your\nproject early on could end up helping your proposal being voted in favor of. If\nyou submit any idea on Kialo, make sure to post about it on our Discord server\nor in the coming Particl forum so that people can know and discuss it.\n\nAs the decentralized project governance system still requires a bit of work and\nof course, testing, there is still some time left to prepare your proposals\nuntil we hold official voting rounds related to the Community Initiative Fund.\nMore details about these rounds will be included in a next Decentralized Project\nGovernance Update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon’t forget that you can track most of the development process by following us\non Github [https://github.com/particl].

Don’t worry, this all happens automatically under the hood while the entire governance process is displayed in a user-friendly fashion on Particl Desktop.

This new report\ncontains a lot of information about the status of the project’s development as\nwell as a pretty good presentation of the features that are most likely to be\nincluded in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace.\n\nWhat We Are Busy With\nThis section of the report shows what the Particl development team is already\nworking on. These items are currently under active development and are the\nprimary short-term focus points of our developers.\n\nMarketplace\nAs many of you already know, the team is currently heavily focused on developing\nand putting together both the project and marketplace governance systems.\n\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThe project governance system\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] will allow users to\ncreate and submit proposals for the community to vote on. These proposals will\nbe extremely useful to reach consensus within the community in a provably fair\nfashion. This proposal system is required for the community to vote on what to\ndo with the remaining funds in the Community Initiative Fund\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e] \n(~33,000 PART, 100% community-owned).\n\nThe marketplace governance system, on the other hand, is the function that\nallows users to flag undesirable content on Particl Marketplace. As no party\nother than the community itself has moderation powers over the marketplace, this\nfeature is considered an absolute requirement for the marketplace DApp to be\nreleased on mainnet. Indeed, this mechanism gives community moderation powers\nover the content posted on it so that it can stay clean and free of\nreprehensible or spammy content.\n\nAside from both governance systems, there is also quite a few improvements being\nmade to the marketplace based on the various feedback we’ve received from all of\nthe people who have tested the Alpha version. This includes the refactoring of\nseveral aspects of the code, making it much smoother, faster, and intuitive to\nuse, and a few new feature enhancements such as advanced filtering options and\nexpiry time on listed products.\n\nA few items here are actually quite interesting. In fact, the team is currently\nworking on a new hardware wallet integration, Trezor, to give users more options\nwhen it comes to secure storage of funds.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nA major and long-awaited Particl Desktop feature has also started being worked\non [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], namely multi-wallets.\nThis function enables the possibility to set up several different wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is a great feature for both security,\nprivacy, and usability.\n\nTwo Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop InstanceMulti-wallets\nallow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of\nmismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen\nas different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each\nwallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace\nprofiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there\nis no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them,\nthe previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other\nwallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type\nof data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same\nParticl Desktop instance.\n\nThis feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles\nor accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing\nmarketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process.\nUsers can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one\nof them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.\n\nIndeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet,\neven if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each\nstaking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a\ndifferent address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per\nwallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by\nredirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they\nwant (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the\nother 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop\nprojects on the Particl network).\n\nTrezor Integration\nTrezor Hardware WalletWe’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration,\nbut we’re not stopping there. With the goal of providing our users with more\nflexibility by making more options available, we can announce that we have\nstarted working on an integration to the Trezor hardware wallet\n[https://trezor.io/]!\n\n> Trezor is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin\ntransactions. With Trezor, transactions are completely safe even when initiated\non a compromised or vulnerable computer. Because the use of Trezor is very easy\nand intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption among people not familiar\nwith the security issues. —https://wiki.trezor.io/FAQ:Overview\nWaiting for Review\nA few items have been completed and are awaiting the final review before being\nintegrated. Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for\nReview”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade,\nhave been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet\npre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated\nsoon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal\nscreen and notification system for order status changes.\n\nWhat’s on the Horizon — Beta\nThis section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items\nfor the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what\nthe Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the\ndevelopment team will be working in the short to mid-term.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nAs pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are\ngoing to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.\n\nStarting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace\nThis simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode\nonly when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl\nDesktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re\nlaunching it from (~400mb less memory required).\n\nPrivate Markets & Listings\nPrivate markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These\nmarkets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of\nParticl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link\n(usually provided by the market creator).\n\nPrivate listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like\nprivate markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market\nunless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings\nintend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you\nwere to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.\n\nWhile these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they\nare deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed\nwith a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold\nin order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing\nwould be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very\npopular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.\n\nEscrow Enhancements & Deposit Negotiations\nThe decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl\nMarketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the\nvery obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration\nof the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by\nthe NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm.\nOther enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its\nstability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and\nmore.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nAnother needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client\nis a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well\nas various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an\never-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more\noptions as the Particl platform grows.\n\nParticl Software Development Kit\nAnother long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development\ntoolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized\napplications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the\nrelease of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where\noutside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own. We\nfully intend on organizing hack-a-thons and development contests using Particl’s\nSDK, and firmly believe the release of this toolkit will cement Particl as a\nsolid decentralized application platform.\n\nDecentralized Funding & Decentralized Organizations on Particl\nCombining multi-wallets and the Particl SDK will allow people to request\nfundings from Particl stakers for any kind of development actively benefiting\nthe Particl network. While still a few months away from being a real\npossibility, any outside/third-party development team will be able to submit\nformal proposals to the Particl network and request stakers to passively donate\na portion of their staking rewards to a development fund.\n\nThis funding model is quite different than the now popular ICO model, as it\ndoesn’t automatically secure an upfront amount of money to a development team,\ninstead providing a steady but more reasonable stream of funds. This ensures the\ndevelopment teams stay motivated and incentivized to develop the product that\nthey promised the community, which is even truer when the funding itself can be\ncut at any moment by the stakers (they only need to stop redirecting their\nstaking rewards to this project’s development fund).\n\nThis form of funding model also encourages developers to build products that are\nbeneficial to the entire Particl ecosystem itself. That is because decentralized\napplications on Particl will work using the PART coin, at least initially, and\ndo not allow developers to create tokens for themselves and disregard the\nParticl ecosystem as a whole. This is true for stakers as well, redirecting\ntheir staking rewards to a project’s development fund does not award them with\nany kind of token, therefore they will want to donate to projects that are going\nto be directly beneficial to the Particl platform, coin, and ecosystem.\n\nStay Tuned!\nThere is so much development being made on Particl right now, stay tuned for\nmore detailed updates about each of the aforementioned items as they near\nmainnet or testnet implementation. The Status Report is always a good way to\nkeep yourself up-to-date with all development updates surrounding the project.\nDon’t forget to also take a look at our Github page, especially the Pull Request\ntabs of each of our repositories.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-shG0fKUWbiPYc27Fahxn-Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>If you haven’t noticed yet, <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">a new development Status Report has recently been posted on our website</a>.

This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type of data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same Particl Desktop instance.</p><p>This feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles or accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing marketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process. Users can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one of them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.</p><p>Indeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet, even if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each staking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a different address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per wallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by redirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they want (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the other 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop projects on the Particl network).</p><h3 id=\"trezor-integration\">Trezor Integration</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-VhiG1xJJr_vYYsJczTCLyw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Trezor Hardware Wallet</figcaption></figure><p>We’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration, but we’re not stopping there.

Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for Review”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade, have been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet pre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated soon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal screen and notification system for order status changes.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-horizon-beta\">What’s on the Horizon — Beta</h2><p>This section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items for the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what the Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the development team will be working in the short to mid-term.</p><h3 id=\"multi-wallets-1\">Multi-Wallets</h3><p>As pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are going to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.</p><h3 id=\"starting-particl-desktop-without-the-marketplace\">Starting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace</h3><p>This simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode only when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl Desktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re launching it from (~400mb less memory required).</p><h3 id=\"private-markets-listings\">Private Markets &amp; Listings</h3><p>Private markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These markets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of Particl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link (usually provided by the market creator).</p><p>Private listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like private markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market unless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings intend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you were to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.</p><p>While these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they are deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed with a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold in order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing would be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very popular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.</p><h3 id=\"escrow-enhancements-deposit-negotiations\">Escrow Enhancements &amp; Deposit Negotiations</h3><p>The decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl Marketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the very obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration of the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm. Other enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its stability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and more.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>Another needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client is a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well as various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an ever-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more options as the Particl platform grows.</p><h2 id=\"particl-software-development-kit\">Particl Software Development Kit</h2><p>Another long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development toolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized applications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the release of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where outside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own. We fully intend on organizing hack-a-thons and development contests using Particl’s SDK, and firmly believe the release of this toolkit will cement Particl as a solid decentralized application platform.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-funding-decentralized-organizations-on-particl\">Decentralized Funding &amp; Decentralized Organizations on Particl</h3><p>Combining multi-wallets and the Particl SDK will allow people to request fundings from Particl stakers for any kind of development actively benefiting the Particl network. While still a few months away from being a real possibility, any outside/third-party development team will be able to submit formal proposals to the Particl network and request stakers to passively donate a portion of their staking rewards to a development fund.</p><p>This funding model is quite different than the now popular ICO model, as it doesn’t automatically secure an upfront amount of money to a development team, instead providing a steady but more reasonable stream of funds. This ensures the development teams stay motivated and incentivized to develop the product that they promised the community, which is even truer when the funding itself can be cut at any moment by the stakers (they only need to stop redirecting their staking rewards to this project’s development fund).</p><p>This form of funding model also encourages developers to build products that are beneficial to the entire Particl ecosystem itself. That is because decentralized applications on Particl will work using the PART coin, at least initially, and do not allow developers to create tokens for themselves and disregard the Particl ecosystem as a whole. This is true for stakers as well, redirecting their staking rewards to a project’s development fund does not award them with any kind of token, therefore they will want to donate to projects that are going to be directly beneficial to the Particl platform, coin, and ecosystem.</p><h2 id=\"stay-tuned-\">Stay Tuned!</h2><p>There is so much development being made on Particl right now, stay tuned for more detailed updates about each of the aforementioned items as they near mainnet or testnet implementation.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network.

There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
