To eliminate the obstacles\nstanding in the way of Particl’s marketplace adoption, the team has been on a\nvery focused path to deliver a whole range of key features that would make the\nOpen Marketplace user-friendly enough to be considered “adoption-ready” by, in\nthe first place, the crypto community, and then by wider audiences not\nnecessarily in crypto.\n\nChoose a Market While Browsing Listings (WIP, Subject to Change)The Particl team\nis excited to announce that the Market Management functionality will be the next\nbig marketplace feature and is likely to be part of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\n> Note: The information and graphic designs shown in this blog post are still in\nprogress and subject to change.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Market Management Section)\n * What’s “Market Management”?\n * Seller Profile and Identities\n * Market Browser\n * Create a New Market or Storefront\n * Promote a Market\n * Market Governance\n * Market Management Development Status\n * What’s Next After Market Management?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Road Towards a Better Marketplace Adoption\nParticl has been onto a journey to eliminate the obstacles in the way of\nParticl’s adoption. With this very focused objective in mind, developers have\nbeen hard at work to bring forward the key features required before the Open\nMarketplace becomes “adoption-ready”. And things have been moving pretty fast!\n\nBitcoin to be Accepted on Particl\nIn-wallet Bitcoin Exchange (Mainnet Screenshot)On November 1st, Particl announced the upcoming integration of an in-wallet\nexchange module [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] \nto make it super easy for shoppers to buy anything on the marketplace using\nBitcoin. In fact, this new feature is so close to being released that the\nParticl team members flying out to the Slush Helsinki conference have brought\nwith them private builds of the Open Marketplace, on mainnet, WITH the Bitcoin\nexchange module included\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1197137822261665792]. Additionally,\nsince earlier today, the build that they have brought with them is also\navailable on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.0] for everyone to\nplay with.\n\nThis new exchange module, made possible thanks to a brand new SMSG-powered bot\nintegrated right into Particl Desktop, also marks the first step towards\nincluding many more currencies on Particl’s Open Marketplace. This is a critical\nfeature that will allow almost any cryptocurrency user to be able to shop\nonline, on Particl, without fees and without putting any of their personal\ninformation or data at risk. Just swap your coins for Particl right from Particl\nDesktop!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarket Management is Next!\nThe Particl team is taking no time in between major feature releases and is now\nworking on the final integration tweaks required for the Market Management\nfeature to be ready. This major Particl feature will drastically change how the\nOpen Marketplace is interacted with and open up a ton of possibilities for\nsellers and buyers both.\n\nWhat’s “Market Management”?\nMarket Management is a new tool that significantly changes how Particl’s\nmarketplace behaves and is interacted with. It is, simply put, an added\nfunctionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and\nstorefronts. Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl\nmarketplace available, it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user\nmarkets or storefronts that anyone can create. It will, however, remain as the\ndefault marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access\nto and see this giant public marketplace.\n\n> For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be\nreferred to as “markets”.\nWhile the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities\nof Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up,\nright?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating\nthe code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions\ncomes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.\n\n> Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.\nSeller Profiles and Identities\nSeller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought\nforth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.\n\nSeller profiles, identities, and market in short…The seller profile: A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and\nmany profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be\nconnected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an\ninfinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or\ncreates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A\nseller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.\n\nIdentities: Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key\nis used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content\nwhile the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A\nprofile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to\ncreate a market.\n\nIdentities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That\ncan either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or\nexpose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the\nmaximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every\ntime you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities\ntogether nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.\n\nTo sum it up, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This\nseller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts.\nEach market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities\nwhich cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.\n\n> Note: Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version\nof Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the\nwallet.\nMarket Browser\nAnother huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a\ncompletely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage,\nflag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market\nManagement tool and is separated into three distinct categories.\n\nMarket Browser (WIP, subject to change)Available Markets: The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly\navailable markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets\nthat have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The\nAvailable tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and\nstorefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market\nID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that\nyou can easily share them with other people.\n\nJoined Markets: The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you\nhave joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets\nwith a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code\n(the “Market ID”).\n\nYour markets: The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote\nmarkets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to\ngo if you want to create a brand market of your own.\n\nCreate a New Market or Storefront\nCreate a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)Market Management gives you the\nability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by\nchoosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll\nfind in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and\npermissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put\nsimply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a\nregular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.\n\nPublicly listed or not? Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the\nMarket Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market\nBrowser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code\n(the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it.\nWhen a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone\nthat doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To\nbe publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running\nParticl, a market has to be “listed”, for a small market listing/promotion fee\nthat is then redistributed to stakers.\n\nA “public” market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser\nby its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public\nmarkets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without\nhaving to know its access code (“Market ID”).\n\nMarket or Storefront? When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two\ndifferent types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two\ntypes of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that\nanyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products\nwhereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.\n\nIn fact, storefronts are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can\nset up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been\ngiven the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders.\nFor more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can\npublish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that\nthey have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of\nMarket Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given\nstorefront.\n\nStorefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores,\npersonalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are\nalso ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.\n\nJust like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market\nBrowser or not.\n\nPromote a Market\nPromoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted”\nicon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying\na small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the\nParticl network.\n\nMarket Governance\nEvery market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user\ngovernance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a\nmarket can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when\ntoo many people report it.\n\nMarket Management Development Status\nThe marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of\nthe Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything\nis smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki\nconference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few\ntests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!\n\n> Note: Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI\nintegration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this\nblog post.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nMarket Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what\nare going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it. Here are two\nof the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added\nsoon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.\n\nInventory Management\nPreview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)The\nInventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to\nthe marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory\nmanagement capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell\npre-determined amounts of items.\n\nOn the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple\ntimes without requiring the seller to create new listings.\n\nInventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the\nfirst OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e.\nchoosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).\n\nAdjustable Escrow\nAnother key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability\nto adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and\nthe buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of\nthe value of the item being purchased.\n\nWith an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of\nthe value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the\nescrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be\nrequired to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.\n\nA lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double\ndeposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far\nfrom ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or\nthat has a shaky or disputed reputation.\n\nFor sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need\nthe escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for\neach sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their\ncustomers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something\ncustomers would like to bypass as well.\n\nLet’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell\nproducts on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They\nhave a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential\nissue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple\nselling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and\nconsumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that\nspecific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle\nand not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the\ncustomer).\n\nIt is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and\nthat you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out\nentirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the\nadded benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process\nof buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like\nautomatic processing and delivery of digital items.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020,\nyou’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of\nthem bringing new features and noticeable improvements.\n\nAs always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through\ncommunity testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback\nof the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by\ncollecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the\nmarketplace will get better. If you encounter any issue or have feedback for the\ndevelopers, never hesitate to log an issue on Github by clicking on the “Report\na bug” icon at the bottom left of the Particl Desktop client, or simply by\nfollowing this link: https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues. This is\nthe simplest way to voice your opinion and a sure way for you to make sure the\ndevelopers will see it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-HD9QKfTUuqqxOx30CYDCBg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"create-and-join-an-unlimited-number-of-markets-\">Create and Join an Unlimited Number of Markets ?</h3><p>The Particl team is moving fast and methodically!

Here are two of the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added soon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-management\">Inventory Management</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-knGEEEDMYRZ-yVxf3Uf8Ww.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Preview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>The Inventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to the marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory management capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell pre-determined amounts of items.</p><p>On the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple times without requiring the seller to create new listings.</p><p>Inventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the first OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e. choosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow\">Adjustable Escrow</h3><p>Another key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability to adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and the buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item being purchased.</p><p>With an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of the value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the escrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be required to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.</p><p>A lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double deposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far from ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or that has a shaky or disputed reputation.</p><p>For sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need the escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for each sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their customers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something customers would like to bypass as well.</p><p>Let’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell products on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They have a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential issue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple selling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and consumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that specific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle and not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the customer).</p><p>It is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and that you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out entirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the added benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process of buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like automatic processing and delivery of digital items.</p><hr><p>Particl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020, you’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of them bringing new features and noticeable improvements.</p><p>As always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through community testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback of the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by collecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the marketplace will get better.

Just swap your coins for Particl right from Particl Desktop!</p><hr><h2 id=\"market-management-is-next-\">Market Management is Next!</h2><p>The Particl team is taking no time in between major feature releases and is now working on the final integration tweaks required for the Market Management feature to be ready. This major Particl feature will drastically change how the Open Marketplace is interacted with and open up a ton of possibilities for sellers and buyers both.</p><h3 id=\"what-s-market-management-\"><strong>What’s “Market Management”?</strong></h3><p>Market Management is a new tool that significantly changes how Particl’s marketplace behaves and is interacted with. It is, simply put, <strong>an added functionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and storefronts.</strong> Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl marketplace available,<strong> it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user markets or storefronts that anyone can create</strong>. It will, however, remain as the default marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access to and see this giant public marketplace.</p><blockquote>For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be referred to as “markets”.</blockquote><p>While the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities of Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up, right?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating the code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions comes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.</p><blockquote>Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.</blockquote><h3 id=\"seller-profiles-and-identities\">Seller Profiles and Identities</h3><p>Seller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought forth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-C66uBOkpLRs_j0H7ytHaJQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Seller profiles, identities, and market in short…</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The seller profile:</strong> A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and many profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be connected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an infinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or creates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A seller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.</p><p><strong>Identities:</strong> Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key is used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content while the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A profile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to create a market.</p><p>Identities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That can either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or expose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the maximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every time you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities together nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.</p><p><strong>To sum it up</strong>, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This seller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts. Each market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities which cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version of Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the wallet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"market-browser\">Market Browser</h3><p>Another huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a completely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage, flag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market Management tool and is separated into three distinct categories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-K0kMclqwOPZkJo5ffunCGg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Market Browser (WIP, subject to change)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Available Markets:</strong> The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly available markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets that have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The Available tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and storefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market ID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that you can easily share them with other people.</p><p><strong>Joined Markets: </strong>The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you have joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets with a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code (the “Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Your markets:</strong> The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote markets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to go if you want to create a brand market of your own.</p><h3 id=\"create-a-new-market-or-storefront\">Create a New Market or Storefront</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-6HRfeYPykMHYnb46Bu_gXQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Create a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management gives you the ability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by choosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll find in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and permissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put simply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a regular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.</p><p><strong>Publicly listed or not? </strong>Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market Browser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code (the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it. When a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone that doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To be publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running Particl, a market has to be “listed”, <strong>for a small market listing/promotion fee that is then redistributed to stakers.</strong></p><p>A <strong>“public”</strong> market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser by its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public markets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without having to know its access code (“Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Market or Storefront?</strong> When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two different types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two types of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that anyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products whereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-bvwUL0TWSKaQ6ba9V7dCNg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In fact, <strong>storefronts </strong>are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can set up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been given the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders. For more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can publish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that they have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of Market Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given storefront.</p><p>Storefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores, personalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are also ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.</p><p>Just like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not.</p><h3 id=\"promote-a-market\">Promote a Market</h3><p>Promoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted” icon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying a small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the Particl network.</p><h3 id=\"market-governance\">Market Governance</h3><p>Every market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user governance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a market can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when too many people report it.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-development-status\">Market Management Development Status</h3><p>The marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of the Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything is smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki conference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few tests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI integration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this blog post.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><p>Market Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what are going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it.

After all, a big brand like Apple selling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and consumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that specific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle and not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the customer)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and that you could opt-out of it when creating a listing.

Woods is\na veteran with more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries. He brings extensive expertise and reach within the retail and\nconsumer markets and will pro-actively work in bridging the gap between the\ntraditional finance sector and cryptocurrency.\n\nMr. Woods will advise Particl on the opportunities to disrupt the fintech\nindustry that are currently being opened up by distributed technologies and how\nbest to capitalize on them. In addition, Woods will actively work on realizing\nthese opportunities by tapping right into his vast network of merchants and\nbusinesses and connect them with Particl for its world-class technologies and\ndecentralized services.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Case for Connecting Fintech Businesses to Particl\nMany businesses, like tech companies operating outside the cryptocurrency\nindustry but actively looking to modernize and optimize their business flow, can\nbenefit from Particl’s range of decentralized services. For example, a business\nmay simply want to accept cryptocurrency payments, but another may also need to\ntransfer data securely and privately, without third-party custody of the data.\nIn that case, they could use Particl’s peer-to-peer data storage network called\nSMSG and integrate it into their model.\n\nOnline retailers, who constantly need to lower their costs or worry about the\nprivacy and security of their data may want to open shop and sell products on\nParticl’s decentralized and private-by-default marketplace. After all, it\ncharges no commission! Other companies may only have a need for Particl’s double\ndeposit escrow system to keep certain parties in check with each other.\n\n> “Through his many years working right in the heart of the payment industry,\nBryan has developed lasting relationships with many businesses that are\ncurrently looking for ways to implement distributed technologies.Bryan will be\nworking closely with Particl to advise on the exact needs and requirements of\nthese companies and actively help onboarding them with Particl’s wide array of\ndecentralized services.” —Gerlof van Ek, Co-Founder at Particl\n\nIn fact, most businesses have surprisingly high levels of inefficiencies. This\ncosts them profits, time, and opportunities. Some of these hurdles are caused by\nhuman activity, regulations, politics, but some of them are also caused by\ntechnological bottlenecks. Coincidentally, it appears that more and more\nbusinesses realize the potential that distributed technologies present (P2P,\nblockchain). Of course, most of them would never dare, nor need to, go “full\ncrypto”, but just the right amount of distributed technology at the right place\nwithin their operations can make all the difference.\n\nThis shift of mentality within the traditional finance industry is opening up a\nlot of doors, and this is the opportunity that Bryan Woods wants to seize, with\nParticl.\n\n> Note: While Particl has already met and been introduced to some businesses\nwithin Bryan’s network, it may still take some time until the first few\nimplementations are ready and deployed. It is not impossible that the first few\ndeployments will occur in early 2020, as opposed to 2019. As always, follow\nParticl.news to not miss any update!\nLeveraging Spend.com’s Technology\nThe coming of Bryan as an advisor also opens up many interplay opportunities\nbetween both Spend and Particl’s ecosystems.\n\nSpend is a next-generation banking ecosystem with tens of thousands of active\nusers. It acts as a fiat gateway and “banking services 2.0\" provider. Its\nall-in-one mobile application allows you to hold, transfer, deposit, and\nwithdraw multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat (currently only USD and CAD) without\nrequiring a bank. Spend also makes spending very easy through its different\nSpend Visa payment card options that automatically and instantly converts any\ncurrency enabled for card payments into the currency requested by the merchant.\nFurther down the line, it is also intended for Spend App to include many other\nservices, such as loans, interest, and even a full-blown merchant or marketplace\nintegration. The end goal for Spend is to keep all the financial activities of\nits users within the Spend App itself. Think of it as the ultimate banking\napplication.\n\nIn addition to connecting Particl and other businesses together, Bryan and his\nteam at Spend will actively explore, along with the Particl team, how both\nprojects can synergize together to push the adoption of distributed technologies\nand cryptocurrencies to a wider audience.\n\nOn one hand, Spend.com offers a full suite of gateway and payment services that\ncan help onboard people to the Particl platform much more effectively. These\nservices include the near-instant and cost-effective swap of currencies, fiat on\nand off-ramps, Visa payment cards, and etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the multiple decentralized services produced by the Particl\nteam can allow Spend’s ecosystem to blossom into a powerful application that\nseamlessly combines the traditional banking industry and distributed\ntechnologies, making the adoption of new users into alternative banking and\ncryptocurrencies much easier than ever.\n\nA Methodical & Strategic Approach to Increasing Particl’s Stability\nBy integrating Particl’s decentralized services into other businesses, an\nincreased number of transactions is expected to occur on the native Particl\nblockchain and on the markets, providing the entire network and its various\napplications (i.e. Particl’s decentralized marketplace) with more privacy,\nliquidity, and stability.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this new strategic relationship between Bryan\nWoods and the Particl team marks the official beginning of a long-term and very\nstrategic play to take the banking and eCommerce worlds through the next\nevolutionary hop. As a result, to ensure the trading markets can absorb the new\ninflux of activity caused by businesses integrating Particl services,\nintegrations will be deployed methodically, one by one, in a way that ensures\nmarket stability. Over time, each added integration will contribute to\nincreasing the overall liquidity of the markets, making it easier to deploy more\nintegrations and more services at a much faster pace.\n\nParticl’s First Few Steps Towards a Comprehensive SDK\nFor Particl, this phase also marks a very important milestone. These are the\nfirst few steps towards building and packaging a comprehensive developer SDK. \nThe process of building integrations for third-parties will give the team a\nbrand new perspective on what components are the most critical for developers\nlooking forward to using a Particl SDK and will considerably speed up the\nprocess of finalizing and releasing it. In a way, the team will have to go\nthrough some of the same steps developers will go through when using the SDK, so\nhighlighting needs and issues should be much quicker.\n\nSuch integrations will demonstrate that with a bit of creativity, blockchain\ntechnology and cryptocurrencies can offer very practical and disruptive\nsolutions to some of the most pressing issues present within the traditional\nbanking, payment, and eCommerce systems.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Bryan Woods\n> Bryan has more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its \nParticl World Tour [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] \nby first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —\nMoney2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], WCC [https://worldcryptocon.com/], and \nSFBW’s Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/].\n\nIt’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the\nteam has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a\nsignificant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new\nfriends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey!\nAlong the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds,\nbusiness owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a new\nadvisor [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329], Bryan\nWoods [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167] (Spend.com\n[https://spend.com]’s President) to assist and support the project in making the\nbest out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and\neCommerce industries. The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most\nof the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm that has grown\ncloser to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019.\nTheir insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have\nproven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.\n\nFor this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team split into different\ngroups and spread out on the US West Coast (San Francisco & Las Vegas) to cover\nmultiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of\nground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best\nleveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s\nEpicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet,\nin-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get\nthe most done out of it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSan Francisco\nWhile a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion\nwas already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week.\nEpicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two\ndays as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of\ninterest!\n\nThe city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted\nthe entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based\ncryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco\nand the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the\ntech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of\ncreating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very\nmuch within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.\n\nSFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the\nweek) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first\npoints of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events\nand evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two\ndays of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made\nduring the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with\nthese people.\n\nBefore Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain\nWeek’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a\nquick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As\nis now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and\ninterest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around,\nlike the stand-up guys over at Cracking Crypto\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto],\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto] for example.\n\nDr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto ShowThe team also attended\nmore than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?)\nall throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital,\nPantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and\nmore. The connections established at all these events really did set the state\nfor when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.\n\nLas Vegas\nAnd so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW,\nJoe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend Money2020\n[https://us.money2020.com/] and the World Crypto Conference (WCC)\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nParticl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New AdvisorAt Money2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], a Fintech conference focused on\ninnovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on sealing the\ndeal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com. Spend.com is a\nteam that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the\nConsensus 2019 booth in New York City.\n\nThe Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth (one of the big\nsponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into\n2020. This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier\nin October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com. Meeting once again, at Money2020,\nallowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term\nrelationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog\npost published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!\n\nSpecial shoutout to Nicholas Merten [https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten], aka \nDataDash [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw], which the\nteam had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication,\nand projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream\nadoption really impressed!\n\nNicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with ParticlThen, after Money2020,\nCryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher\nstayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the WCC conference\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nWCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been\nlooking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the\nfirst points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC\nattracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain\nindustry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting\nthe team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.\n\nJoe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event\nAnd then came Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/], the main event of the\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before\nand came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main\nentrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.\n\nParticl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s EpicenterJust like\nthroughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were\noverwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised\nthat a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live\nand looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has\nbeen receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.\n\nEpicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more\nfocused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to\nunderstand. The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than\ntwo-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true\npioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave. They are the people fighting\nin the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will\none day catch up on the mainstream level.\n\nAnd in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech\ninnovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences\ndon’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the\nlong-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that\nare making it happen.\n\nThis is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew\nthe potential of this local blockchain community, thanks in part to attending\nthe SF-based Bitcoin2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] \nconference earlier in the year, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and\nexcited crowd.\n\n, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research InstituteAnd the team\nwas right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with\nthought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many\nadvice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with \nDon Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute\n[https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/], and earn 30 minutes of his time\njust before flying out to Europe.\n\nIndeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs,\nand evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing\nblockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers,\nbusiness developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve\na Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the\nway that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.\n\nThe team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr.\nKap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended\nthe talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and\nintentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days\nby the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s\npresentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.\n\n> The upload originally is a Periscope\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] \n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB]video\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] taken by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. You can check out more video of the team in San\nFrancisco by browsing Ben’s Periscope uploads here: \nhttps://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1jMJgwZoNjWJL?t=1s\nThe team used the exposure and momentum provided by a full week of intensive\nnetworking to announce to major pieces of news that will help propel the project\nforward —an in-wallet integration of a Bitcoin exchange module\n[https://particl.news/particl-announces-bitcoin-exchange-integration-into-particl-desktop-e7c0940c0b4d] \nand the official beginning of an intimate and long-term relationship with\nSpend.com [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329]. Bryan\nWoods, Spend.com’s President, was announced at the same time as a new advisor to\nthe project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTakeaways\nThink of this whole US West Coast trip as a giant, never-ending brainstorming\nsession with not only team members, but advisors, leaders, and experts from many\ndifferent industries hungry to see any solid blockchain tech succeed.\n\nThe Particl Team Debriefing Post-SFBWThe people the team met get it. They get\nthe potential of blockchain and Particl both. They want to see the industry\nsucceed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday\npeople.\n\nWhile the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now\ncrystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its\nOpen Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other\nend-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive\npotential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people\nmet during this trip.\n\nBut getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more. \nThe best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by\nanyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and\noffers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new\nadoption-focused phase the project is headed to.\n\nThe team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside\nperspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will\nbe very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that\nadoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with\nthe best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do\nthis! ?\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThe development team has been focused on the next few items, as identified a\nwhile ago\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b]\n, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy\nconversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a\nfew features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users\nto the marketplace.\n\nIn the meantime, the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new\nphase to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for\nadoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin\nin the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the\npast two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the\nOpen Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot\ntowards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nIt is very clear, the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely\nmotivated and hungry for success. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts,\ndirectly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is\nreceptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this\nnow-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very\nmethodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nParticl Team After Epicenter’s ClosureAs you might start to understand simply by\nreading this post, this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives,\nchallenges, and goals for the project. Think of it as the “war room phase”, the\nmoment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.\n\nNext Locations of the Particl World Tour\nWith that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two\nadditional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.\n\nIndeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at Blockshow Asia\n[https://blockshow.com/], in Singapore, and Slush Helsinki\n[https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/], in Finland.\n\nAt Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s\nside-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first\npoints of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get\nas much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e] on\nParticl.news, Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax\nregulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with\ncryptocurrencies a tax-free event. It is a direct use-case for buying and\nselling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine\nbrightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream\nin Singapore…\n\nAt Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be\noperating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically\ngoing to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will\nconsist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead\nDesigner, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria\n(Particl’s Communications & Strategy Team).\n\nBoth these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and\nresources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t\nbe better!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou, Too, Can Be a Part of it!\nThe best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in\nthe space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their\nrelated side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are\nthe active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain\nrevolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there\nand attend your local blockchain events. Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and\nkicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators\nmore motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by\nthe “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be\nright in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole\nadded here ?).\n\nAfter all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just\none part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so\nmuch FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned for more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming\nThursday, the 14th of November. Then, on the 21st of November, Particl will be\nhaving another surprise announcement!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-fg-rxBVAgcC3I7WZpZR3dA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"recap-dr-kap-s-own-video-recap-of-the-events-\">Recap + Dr. Kap’s Own Video Recap of the Events ?</h3><p>The Particl team is finally back home from its US West Coast trip and hot damn was it an eventful week!

They get the potential of blockchain and Particl both. <strong>They want to see the industry succeed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday people.</strong></p><p>While the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now crystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its Open Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other end-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive potential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people met during this trip.</p><p><strong>But getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more.</strong> The best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by anyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &amp; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a> by first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —<a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong> Money2020</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>WCC</strong></a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB1yf5CaXHI\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a significant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new friends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey! Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019. Their insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have proven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXnJg_HTXI8?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this first part of the Particl World Tour, <strong>the team split into different groups and spread out on the US West Coast</strong> (San Francisco &#x26; Las Vegas) to cover multiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together.

They get the potential of blockchain and Particl both. <strong>They want to see the industry succeed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday people.</strong></p><p>While the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now crystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its Open Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other end-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive potential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people met during this trip.</p><p><strong>But getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more.</strong> The best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by anyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &#x26; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

Initially mentioned\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] last Friday by\nDr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his 30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc], this new payment option will\nallow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace.\nThis news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this\nparticular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open\nMarketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part\nof the Particl community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Payment Integration\nHow the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate,\nstandalone BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop. The module will\ninteract with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part\nof the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a separate page within\nParticl Desktop.\n\nThe reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received\nPART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you\nprobably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be\nable to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a\npublic balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more\nconfirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations\n(incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently\nstands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a\nuser-friendly and practical way.\n\nExchange Module…as a Separate Page\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a\nsimple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl\nDesktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu\ncurrently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address\nBook. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section\nof the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet,\nmeaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.\n\nPutting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means\nBitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin,\nallowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to\nbe paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).\n\nExchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process\nWhile the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the\nforeseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and\ninteract with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of\npurchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart,\nconfirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on\nthe order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two\nbuttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the\nexchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the\n“Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will\nredirect you to the exchange module.\n\nOnce there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary\nto pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire\nthat many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange\nmodule and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be\nable to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and\nsuccessfully place your order.\n\nSo while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange\nmodule will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and\nuser-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThis BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of\ndecentralized exchange method, at least not for its initial integration.\nInstead, it will be plugged into a non-custodial exchange that doesn’t require\nKYC or personal information —SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)The module uses SMSG to relay messages between Particl and the\nSimpleSwap engine. The key part to understand is that this exchange module has\nbeen built using SMSG in a very generic matter, and it could eventually be used\nas the base layers to deploy all sorts of services on Particl (i.e. price\npegging, chat module, etc). This module is likely to be included in the incoming\nParticl SDK which is probably going to see the day somewhere in 2020.\n\nA “per transaction” limit function has also been integrated into the module as\nwell, making sure users exchange a number of coins that’s in between the minimum\nand maximum range allowed by the exchange. Most of the information that is\nusually displayed when making a transaction on [https://simpleswap.io/]\nSimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/] will also all be displayed right from\nParticl Desktop.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange module will also include an “auto-anonymizer” feature\nwhich will allow you to automatically receive your PART on anon balances. This\nadditional privacy feature included in Particl Desktop’s exchange module isn’t\navailable when simply going on [https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap\n[https://simpleswap.io/]’s website. That RingCT exchange perk feature may, or\nmay not, be part of the first iteration of the exchange module, but it is\nalready in development and should follow very shortly after the first release if\nnot immediately ready. Fingers crossed!\n\nFinally, the exchange module is not designed or hardcoded to work only using \n[https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/]. That particualr\nexchange was chosen as the initial service provider because of the lack of KYC\nrequirements and the relatively low friction involved in trades. Should new\nexchanges that provide similar benefits list PART, they could be added to the\nmodule, giving users even more options.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll About Adoption and Speed\nThis integration of a BTC-PART payment module is directly in line with the\nteam’s current focus on eliminating the barriers to entry and kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl network. It significantly increases the potential amount\nof users that can use the Particl ecosystem and makes getting PART as easy as it\nhas ever been.\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)While the feature itself is not entirely ready as of the time of\nthis writing, the team has completed the back-end code as well as the testing\nand is currently finalizing the GUI integration. That should be completed within\na few days, and then more testing will be required to make sure its integration\ninto Particl Desktop hasn’t highlighted any new issue. While a definitive\nrelease date cannot be committed to at this moment, we are getting pretty close\nfor the feature to be fully ready. The exchange module will be released as part\nof Particl Desktop 2.3.0.\n\nNote: Particl Desktop 2.2.0 is currently being tested on testnet and should be\nreleased within just a few days. Aside from the new Global Settings feature, it\nwill mostly include bug fixes, flow optimizations, and UI/UX improvements.\nParticl Desktop 2.2.0 and Particl Desktop 2.3.0 are estimated to be released in\nvery close proximity.\n\nThe Pieces are Falling Into Place\nThe Particl team is full steam ahead and working tirelessly on kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl platform. Stay alert as you can expect some exciting\nnews to be published soon on Particl.news. Suffice to say, the future of Particl\nis looking brighter every day as the pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall\ninto place at a very interesting pace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-kqXnceUmmgRlUGrFYGulPw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-SvvDdJMh8rUGGY0sr516iQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>Today we’re excited to officially announce more details about Particl’s integration of a Bitcoin exchange module into the Particl Desktop client.

This news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this particular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open Marketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part of the Particl community.</p><hr><h2 id=\"bitcoin-payment-integration\">Bitcoin Payment Integration</h2><p>How the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate, standalone <strong>BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop</strong>. The module will interact with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part of the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a <strong>separate page within Particl Desktop</strong>.</p><p>The reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received PART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you probably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be able to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a public balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more confirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations (incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently stands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a user-friendly and practical way.</p><h3 id=\"exchange-module-as-a-separate-page\">Exchange Module…as a Separate Page</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-KKLpgt3EjonmytUBz1ypiQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a simple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl Desktop!

Right at that moment, you will be met with two buttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the exchange module.

This script is intended to be executed on staking nodes as a companion\nto the Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] cold staking application,\nbut can also be executed without Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] \nbeing installed on the node. In that case, Partyman\n[https://github.com/dasource/partyman] will automatically be installed to the\nlatest version by the Private Cold Staking script.\n\n> Note: Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] is the application\nrequired to create and run a cold staking node on the Particl network. Follow \nthis tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4] to\nlearn how to install and use it so that you can safely cold stake your funds.\nPrivate Cold Staking V1.0Download: https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking\n\nGBen1/Private-Coldstaking [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\nThis script allows you to anonymize automatically your coldstaking rewards on\nyour node and to redirect them… [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\n\nTo install directly on your staking node, type the following commands:\n\ncd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n\ncd Private-Coldstaking && bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n\nPPoS — A Security-Focused Proof-of-Stake Protocol\nParticl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) is Particl’s very own and super secure\nProof-of-Stake algorithm. In fact, it is one of the most secure PoS algorithms\nin the blockchain space due to its cold staking capabilities.\n\nFor those not familiar with it, cold staking allows you to delegate the staking\nweight of your funds to a node which contains no coin, meaning that the wallet\nthat actually holds the coins can be taken offline and still contribute to\nsecuring the Particl network (and receive staking rewards for it). What makes\nthe cold staking capabilities of PPoS even more secure is the fact that it can\nbe used in combination with a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S device, for\nexample, bringing its level of security to an absurdly high level.\n\nOne thing Particl Proof-of-Stake does not do, however, is private/stealth\nstaking. In other words, you can only stake funds held in public balances, but\nnot in blind or anon balances. But considering the great privacy protocols\navailable on the Particl network (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT),\nthere really shouldn’t be any reason why staking privately shouldn’t be\npossible.\n\nWhy isn’t PPoS Private by Default in the First Place?\nAs the previous section of this blog post mentions, PPoS is a security-focused\nProof-of-Stake protocol, meaning security comes first before anything else.\nAfter all, PoS protocols are what’s responsible for the verification of\ntransactions and the creation of coins on the network. If something goes wrong\nhere, it can spell a lot of troubles for the chain.\n\nThe main issue with a fully private Proof-of-Stake protocol is auditability. In\nfact, while it could be proven without a doubt that the inflation model is fine\n(you can prove the right amount of coins is being created at the right time, and\nyou can detect if an exploit if being used to create a fraudulent amount of\ncoins at the inflation level), it’s not possible, however, to detect some edge\ncases where an attacker would be able to create coins out of thin air without\nissuing them through the usual inflation process.\n\nNote that Proof-of-Work coins with a “private by default” approach to mining,\nsuch as Monero, are also vulnerable to this issue. This isn’t a vulnerability\nthat is exclusive to Proof-of-Stake. At this point, there has been a few\ninstances of inflation-related attacks, notably in regards to the Zerocoin\nprotocol\n[https://cryptoslate.com/zerocoin-exploit-found-zcoin-attacked-other-privacy-coins-at-risk/] \n(Zerocoin, PIVX, Veil, etc) which had to be disabled on the affected coins.\nThere has been a similar bug on Monero and some of its forks\n[https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html] \nwhich would have allowed an attacker to create an unlimited amount of coins\nwithout ever being able to detect it. Luckily, this has never been exploited and\nthe bug has been fixed a long time before. Imagine thousands upon thousands of\ncoins being generated out of thin air without anyone being able to detect it…\n\nMaking Cold Staking Private Without the Security Concessions\n)But, again, considering the great privacy protocols available on the Particl\nnetwork (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT), there really shouldn’t be\nany reason why staking privately shouldn’t be possible. And this is where the\nPrivate Cold Staking script comes into action.\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script is a script coded by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. It allows you to automatically anonymize your\nstaking rewards using RingCT. This means you can now safely cold stake your\ncoins and remain anonymous on the network.\n\nBecause the script doesn’t operate at the protocol level, it can provide a very\npowerful level of privacy without compromising on the security side of things.\nTo be clear, with this script, Particl Proof-of-Stake remains untouched. The\nprivacy aspect of things is granted by the Private Cold Staking script itself.\n\nWhat it Can and Can’t Do\nThe Private Cold Staking script is intended to be used as a companion tool to\nthe Partyman cold staking app. It has to be used directly on your cold staking\nnode and uses entropy to obfuscate patterns\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md], thus\nincreasing the level of privacy. This script allows you to do three things:\n\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a public\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a blind (CT)\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to an anon (RingCT\n   ) address of your choice\n\nThe Private Cold Staking cannot, however, stake funds held on stealth addresses\n(blind or anon balances).\n\n> Note: Due to the nature of the script, a few coins will be held on your cold\nstaking node for a small amount of time (under 24 hours). It is not recommended\nto use this script if your staking environment isn’t safe (i.e. shared computer,\nuntrustworthy VPS, etc).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Private Cold Staking Script\n * Download the script on your cold staking node\n   cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n * Navigate to the script’s directory\n   cd Private-Coldstaking/\n * Execute the script and go through the setup process\n   bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n * Make sure everything is set up properly\n   bash update.sh\n * If you wish to uninstall the script, run the uninstaller\n   bash uninstall.sh\n\nFor more information, refer directly to the script’s README file\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md] on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script takes Particl Proof-of-Stake to the next level\nby enabling solid privacy options without sacrificing any of its security. It is\ndirectly in line with Particl’s commitment to both security and privacy. Since\nit will create more anon outputs that can then be used by the network to better\nanonymize other RingCT transactions, it directly contributes to improving the\noverall privacy of the network.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

In fact, it is one of the most secure PoS algorithms in the blockchain space due to its cold staking capabilities.</p><p>For those not familiar with it, cold staking allows you to delegate the staking weight of your funds to a node which contains no coin, meaning that the wallet that actually holds the coins can be taken offline and still contribute to securing the Particl network (and receive staking rewards for it). What makes the cold staking capabilities of PPoS even more secure is the fact that it can be used in combination with a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S device, for example, bringing its level of security to an absurdly high level.</p><p>One thing Particl Proof-of-Stake does not do, however, is private/stealth staking. In other words, you can only stake funds held in public balances, but not in blind or anon balances. But considering the great privacy protocols available on the Particl network (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT), there really shouldn’t be any reason why staking privately shouldn’t be possible.</p><h3 id=\"why-isn-t-ppos-private-by-default-in-the-first-place\">Why isn’t PPoS Private by Default in the First Place?</h3><p>As the previous section of this blog post mentions, PPoS is a security-focused Proof-of-Stake protocol, meaning security comes first before anything else. After all, PoS protocols are what’s responsible for the verification of transactions and the creation of coins on the network. If something goes wrong here, it can spell a lot of troubles for the chain.</p><p>The main issue with a fully private Proof-of-Stake protocol is auditability. In fact, while it could be proven without a doubt that the inflation model is fine (you can prove the right amount of coins is being created at the right time, and you can detect if an exploit if being used to create a fraudulent amount of coins at the inflation level), it’s not possible, however, to detect some edge cases where an attacker would be able to create coins out of thin air without issuing them through the usual inflation process.</p><p>Note that Proof-of-Work coins with a “private by default” approach to mining, such as Monero, are also vulnerable to this issue. This isn’t a vulnerability that is exclusive to Proof-of-Stake. At this point, there has been a few instances of inflation-related attacks, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/zerocoin-exploit-found-zcoin-attacked-other-privacy-coins-at-risk/\"><strong>notably in regards to the Zerocoin protocol</strong></a> (Zerocoin, PIVX, Veil, etc) which had to be disabled on the affected coins. There has been a <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html\"><strong>similar bug on Monero and some of its forks</strong></a> which would have allowed an attacker to create an unlimited amount of coins without ever being able to detect it. Luckily, this has never been exploited and the bug has been fixed a long time before.

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nTo download the Particl Open Marketplace, go to https://particl.io/downloads or \nget it directly from Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1].\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

If you have ever run the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet before, you\n    will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you may\n    encounter errors that will break your experience. The location of your\n    particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\nFor a complete tutorial on how to download, install, and setup the Particl Open\nMarketplace, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/tutorial-how-to-use-the-private-and-trustless-particl-marketplace-11839ea30e09\n\nFor a Wiki version, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.wiki/prepare-install-marketplace\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Open Marketplace\nAlthough the Particl Open Marketplace proposes a new and improved way to shop\nand do business online, it isn’t too different than the marketplaces you’re used\nto use.\n\nFor buyers and sellers, the simple process of going through a transaction can be\nsummarized as follow:\n\n * The buyer places an order\n * The seller accepts the order\n * The buyer locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller packages and ships the order. A tracking number can be included at\n   this point\n * The buyer receives the order, inspects it, and marks the transaction as\n   complete\n\nSounds easy? That’s because it is! In fact, the process of purchasing and\nselling something online without sacrificing your data shouldn’t be a chore and\nshould be accessible to as many people as possible. Yet, if you want to have a\nfull breakdown of how to use the Particl Open Marketplace, you can either read \nthis tutorial blog post\n[https://particl.news/understanding-and-use-of-the-particl-marketplace-9866cd8190f5] \nor consult this Wiki step-by-step guide [https://particl.wiki/how-to-buy-sell].\n\nWhat Can You Buy & Sell\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is a two-sided marketplace. By definition, a\ntwo-sided marketplace is a marketplace for “exchange between\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]two\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/] distinct user\ngroups that provide each other with the benefits of a large network\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]”.\n\nThat means it is entirely up to the users to figure out what they want to buy\nand what they want to sell, and when demand arises, supply should usually follow\nto fill a void. The best example of a two-sided marketplace is eBay — a\nmarketplace where both sellers and buyers are “customers” of and provide each\nother benefits (the seller provides the buyer with items they’re looking for,\nand the buyer provides the sellers with revenue).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThis is only the beginning of a long journey for Particl. This mainnet release,\ndubbed a Beta release, marks the first mainnet iteration of many to come for the\nmarketplace.\n\nIt means a lot of intended features are still not implemented yet, and that a\nlot of improvement will be made along the way. This is why your feedback will be\nextremely valuable. What do you think is missing from this marketplace? How was\nyour experience in a particular situation and how could it be improved?\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the Particl team will be focusing on developing some\nof the core features identified earlier in the year. That includes, but isn’t\nlimited to:\n\n * A mobile application and/or mobile integration\n * The possibility to use other coins on Particl Desktop and/or the marketplace\n * A market management tool allowing for the management of multiple user markets\n * A comment section to allow reviews to be logged in\n * Listing price pegging to allow listings to dynamically adjust their prices in\n   PART\n * And more…\n\nBut for now, it is time to play with the world’s most private and decentralized\nmarketplace as much as possible and observe how it will play out. The Particl\nteam will be on the lookout and will be collecting feedback over the course of\nthe next few days/weeks.\n\nThis important period will certainly help shape the future of the project and\nestablish short to mid-term development priorities.\n\nSo install the marketplace, and let’s get down to business!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-is-Now-Live-on-Mainnet/1-89WBhJh6pZ1PBeAKZB2M3A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It is finally here!

After years of research, development, fine-tuning, refactoring, and\ncommunity-testing, it is finally ready to be unveiled as the world’s most\ndisruptive and empowering marketplace the world has ever seen.\n\nWhat’s Particl and What’s the Open Marketplace?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized platform. There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nWhat’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very\ndeep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the\nbeginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly\nfocused on building the base layer of the marketplace, Beta will be about adding\nvarious features on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for\nvarious types of vendors and buyers.\n\nSo what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open\nMarketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available\nfeatures? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know\nprior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface\nOne of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user\ninterface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great\nfeatures a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too\ndifficult use or too time-consuming to learn.\n\nAnd so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open\nMarketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is\nintegrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is\ndesigned in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it\nworks. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the\nOpen Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very\nintuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your\nhead just to figure out how to make it work.\n\nYes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there\nare definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be\n“grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all\naspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting\nbetter and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards,\nParticl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just\nbeing “good enough” for the crypto crowd.\n\nBuy Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nIt is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most\noptions are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game.\nThese options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many\nsteps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some\ncompany.\n\nIn most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all\ncases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be\nhighly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional\ncurrencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of\nmiddlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend\nour coins?\n\nParticl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default\nmarketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and\npay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the\nthree issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all,\nBitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent\nfrom third-parties, as demonstrated by Satoshi’s early attempt at building a\ndecentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/]\n.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it\ndoesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means\nthat you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to\nbe able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.\n\nFor the buyer, that means you will likely get access to more affordable products\nsince vendors do not need to pay any fee, except for a small anti-spam listing\nfee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per\nsale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always\nreflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.\n\nSave time and energy by instantly and directly connecting with vendors that\nalready accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually\nbrowse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking\nfor…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.\n\nSell Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nNow, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What\nif you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available,\nbut just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to\nfunction. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very\nhigh fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing\nyour business data to some company.\n\nThanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues\nmentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products\nand services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party\nor company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual\ncryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents\nper day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online,\nthis is about as big of as deal as it gets!\n\nImagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or\neven “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge\nopportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can you\nmake much more profit per sale, but you can also reduce your prices to gain a\nnet advantage over your competitors.\n\nAnd, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace,\nmeaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the\nideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours\nfinding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also\nwilling to spend cryptocurrencies for it.\n\nDouble Deposit Escrow System\nParticl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\nParticl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at\nits core. It offers a low-cost, secure…\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]particl.wiki\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\n\n * No fee, except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee\n * Infinitely scalable\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * Privacy-focused\n\nUnlike other marketplaces, the Open Marketplace uses a fee-less and\ndecentralized type of escrow (or resolution center). Just like the rest of the\nplatform, this escrow system doesn’t rely on any third-party for issues to be\nresolved.\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace’s escrow system is based on the Mutually Assured\nDestruction (MAD) game-theory and requires both sellers and buyers to make a\nsecurity deposit, on top of the regular payment, into a smart-contract. The\nsecurity deposits are refunded, in full, to the participants when both of them\nmark the transaction as complete.\n\nNot requiring any third-party for the escrow system dramatically increases\nprivacy since no escrow agent can have access to your transaction details,\nconversation history, and tracking information. It allows you to own your data\nby ensuring that none of it can be collected by any party other than the one you\nare transacting with.\n\nParticl’s double deposit escrow system is also almost free to use. Unlike most\neCommerce platform, protecting yourself from a party you do not know or trust\nwon’t require you to pay anything other than a simple cryptocurrency transaction\nfee.\n\nAs a comparison, some marketplaces and online commerce platforms will charge you\na considerable fee, sometimes as high as 20% per transaction, just for using an\nescrow or mediation service. These fees tend to be higher on B2B-focused\nmarketplaces.\n\nTake Your Privacy Back\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\n\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n * No metadata when uploading files (i.e. listing pictures)\n * No identifiable data generated\n * No account creation, registration, or KYC required\n * IP addresses can easily be hidden\n\nYou would think that a decentralized marketplace that doesn’t require any\nthird-party, at any step of the process, would be better at keeping your data\nprivate. That, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nIn fact, blockchains are publicly auditable ledgers that permanently record your\ndata. And while data written on a blockchain is usually pseudonymous, it is\nentirely possible to collect, analyze, decipher, and use it. Blockchain analysis\nfirms are getting exponentially better at mining and deciphering data stored on\nblockchains.

In other words, if you’re worried about how your data is being collected and\nused (hint: and you should be), using a public blockchain might not be ideal for\nyou.\n\nThat’s precisely why the Open Marketplace is private by default. That means you\nwon’t need to do any extra step to protect your privacy and your data won’t be\nout there on a public blockchain for everyone to see and decipher, at any point\nin time. Particl’s Open Marketplace does it all for you.\n\nBy integrating the Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT privacy protocols\ninto Particl’s double deposit escrow system, all currency transactions are\nhidden on the blockchain and can’t be traced back to users. Additionally, all\ndata uploaded on the marketplace is stripped of all its metadata so that it\ncan’t be reverse engineered (did you know most pictures taken by phones usually\ncontain a geo-tag?).\n\nThe only privacy enhancing feature that is not enabled by default is the Tor\nnetwork integration.

In the case\nof the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party\ninvolved.\n\nParticl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on\ngame-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off\nof the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known\nReddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a\ncertain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But\nunlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open\nMarketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.\n\nThis system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can\neffectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures\nthat only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to\nstay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.\n\n> Note: On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing\nwill get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.\nCommunity Proposals\nDecentralized Project Governance Update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nAs we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun\nworking on the initial version of the…\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Anyone can submit proposals to the community\n * Anyone can vote on proposals\n\nUsing the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any\nParticl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client.\nThis introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency\nusers.\n\nFor example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important\ndecisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to\nfund using the common Community Fund\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm]\n. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about\nwhat type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and\nit is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.\n\nAnd just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own\nvoting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold.

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user\naccounts’ that are completely independent from each other.\n\nMulti-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet\nis entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data\n(purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a\nwallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that\ntwo wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner\nof the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address\nalready identified as belonging to that user.\n\nMulti-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace,\nseller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the\nwallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come\nat a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the\ninitial mainnet version of the marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first\nprivacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and\nwill mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. It will go\nlive, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features\nmentioned in this blog post.\n\nBut don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic\njourney in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This\nrelease will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of\ndevelopment, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on\nout. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it,\nmaking it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can\nalso expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party\nintegrations to see the day.

What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open Marketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available features? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know prior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"slick-modern-and-user-friendly-interface\">Slick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface</h2><p>One of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user interface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great features a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too difficult use or too time-consuming to learn.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-DhXEPhuXIsBc3EKOf938hg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>And so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open Marketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is integrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is designed in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it works. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the Open Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very intuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your head just to figure out how to make it work.</p><p>Yes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there are definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be “grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all aspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting better and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards, Particl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just being “good enough” for the crypto crowd.</p><h2 id=\"buy-stuff-for-crypto\">Buy Stuff for Crypto</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKOA4dOAFeM?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><strong>No fee</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party</strong></li><li><strong>No registration or account creation</strong></li><li><strong>Full escrow support</strong></li><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li></ul><p>It is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most options are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game. These options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many steps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some company.</p><p>In most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all cases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be highly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional currencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of middlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend our coins?</p><p>Particl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default marketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and pay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the three issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all, Bitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent from third-parties, as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/\"><strong>Satoshi’s early attempt at building a decentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase</strong></a>.</p><p>The Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it doesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means that you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to be able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.</p><p>For the buyer, that means <strong>you will likely get access to more affordable products since vendors do not need to pay any fee</strong>, except for a small anti-spam listing fee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per sale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always reflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.</p><p>Save time and energy by <strong>instantly</strong> and <strong>directly</strong> connecting with vendors that already accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually browse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking for…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.</p><h2 id=\"sell-stuff-for-crypto\">Sell Stuff for Crypto</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/86ejmW0BkGI?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><strong>No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party</strong></li><li><strong>No registration or account creation</strong></li><li><strong>Full escrow support</strong></li><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li></ul><p>Now, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What if you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available, but just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to function. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very high fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing your business data to some company.</p><p>Thanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues mentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products and services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party or company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents per day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online, this is about as big of as deal as it gets!</p><p>Imagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or even “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge opportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can <strong>you make much more profit per sale</strong>, but <strong>you can also reduce your prices to gain a net advantage over your competitors</strong>.</p><p>And, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace, meaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the ideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours finding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also willing to spend cryptocurrencies for it.</p><h2 id=\"double-deposit-escrow-system\">Double Deposit Escrow System</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow\"><strong>Particl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow\"><em>Particl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at its core.

Just like the rest of the platform, this escrow system doesn’t rely on any third-party for issues to be resolved.</p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace’s escrow system is based on the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) game-theory and requires both sellers and buyers to make a security deposit, on top of the regular payment, into a smart-contract. The security deposits are refunded, in full, to the participants when both of them mark the transaction as complete.</p><p>Not requiring any third-party for the escrow system dramatically increases privacy since no escrow agent can have access to your transaction details, conversation history, and tracking information. It allows you to own your data by ensuring that none of it can be collected by any party other than the one you are transacting with.</p><p>Particl’s double deposit escrow system is also almost free to use. Unlike most eCommerce platform, protecting yourself from a party you do not know or trust won’t require you to pay anything other than a simple cryptocurrency transaction fee.</p><p>As a comparison, some marketplaces and online commerce platforms will charge you a considerable fee, sometimes as high as 20% per transaction, just for using an escrow or mediation service. These fees tend to be higher on B2B-focused marketplaces.</p><h2 id=\"take-your-privacy-back\">Take Your Privacy Back</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>Particl Explained - Private Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><em>Anonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl Desktop, take privacy to the next level by not…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\">particl.news</a></p><ul><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li><li><strong>No metadata when uploading files (i.e. listing pictures)</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated</strong></li><li><strong>No account creation, registration, or KYC required</strong></li><li><strong>IP addresses can easily be hidden</strong></li></ul><p>You would think that a decentralized marketplace that doesn’t require any third-party, at any step of the process, would be better at keeping your data private.

Yes, there are definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be “grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all aspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting better and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards, Particl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just being “good enough” for the crypto crowd.</p><h2 id=\"buy-stuff-for-crypto\">Buy Stuff for Crypto</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKOA4dOAFeM?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><strong>No fee</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party</strong></li><li><strong>No registration or account creation</strong></li><li><strong>Full escrow support</strong></li><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li></ul><p>It is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most options are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game.

What if you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available, but just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to function.

The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents per day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online, this is about as big of as deal as it gets!</p><p>Imagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or even “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge opportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can <strong>you make much more profit per sale</strong>, but <strong>you can also reduce your prices to gain a net advantage over your competitors</strong>.</p><p>And, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace, meaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the ideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours finding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also willing to spend cryptocurrencies for it.</p><h2 id=\"double-deposit-escrow-system\">Double Deposit Escrow System</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow\"><strong>Particl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow\"><em>Particl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at its core.

Just like the rest of the platform, this escrow system doesn’t rely on any third-party for issues to be resolved.</p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace’s escrow system is based on the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) game-theory and requires both sellers and buyers to make a security deposit, on top of the regular payment, into a smart-contract. The security deposits are refunded, in full, to the participants when both of them mark the transaction as complete.</p><p>Not requiring any third-party for the escrow system dramatically increases privacy since no escrow agent can have access to your transaction details, conversation history, and tracking information. It allows you to own your data by ensuring that none of it can be collected by any party other than the one you are transacting with.</p><p>Particl’s double deposit escrow system is also almost free to use. Unlike most eCommerce platform, protecting yourself from a party you do not know or trust won’t require you to pay anything other than a simple cryptocurrency transaction fee.</p><p>As a comparison, some marketplaces and online commerce platforms will charge you a considerable fee, sometimes as high as 20% per transaction, just for using an escrow or mediation service. These fees tend to be higher on B2B-focused marketplaces.</p><h2 id=\"take-your-privacy-back\">Take Your Privacy Back</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>Particl Explained - Private Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><em>Anonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl Desktop, take privacy to the next level by not…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\">particl.news</a></p><ul><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li><li><strong>No metadata when uploading files (i.e. listing pictures)</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated</strong></li><li><strong>No account creation, registration, or KYC required</strong></li><li><strong>IP addresses can easily be hidden</strong></li></ul><p>You would think that a decentralized marketplace that doesn’t require any third-party, at any step of the process, would be better at keeping your data private. That, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth.</p><p>In fact, blockchains are publicly auditable ledgers that permanently record your data. And while data written on a blockchain is usually pseudonymous, it is entirely possible to collect, analyze, decipher, and use it. Blockchain analysis firms are getting exponentially better at mining and deciphering data stored on blockchains. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members\"><strong>Some of the largest crypto companies are even doing it out in the open</strong></a>. In other words, if you’re worried about how your data is being collected and used (hint: and you should be), using a public blockchain might not be ideal for you.</p><p>That’s precisely why the Open Marketplace is private by default. That means you won’t need to do any extra step to protect your privacy and your data won’t be out there on a public blockchain for everyone to see and decipher, at any point in time. Particl’s Open Marketplace does it all for you.</p><p>By integrating the <strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong> privacy protocols into Particl’s double deposit escrow system, all currency transactions are hidden on the blockchain and can’t be traced back to users. Additionally, all data uploaded on the marketplace is stripped of all its metadata so that it can’t be reverse engineered (did you know most pictures taken by phones usually contain a geo-tag?).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXRFYcg45Aw?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>The only privacy enhancing feature that is not enabled by default is the Tor network integration.</strong> While <a href=\"http://particl.wiki/tor-hs\">easy and very quick to set up</a>, it requires users to manually enable it.

In the case of the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party involved.</p><p>Particl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on game-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off of the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known Reddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a certain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But unlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open Marketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.</p><p>This system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can effectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures that only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to stay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing will get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.</blockquote><h2 id=\"community-proposals\">Community Proposals</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><strong>Decentralized Project Governance Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><em>As we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun working on the initial version of the…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">particl.news</a></p><ul><li><strong>1 coin = 1 vote</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can submit proposals to the community</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can vote on proposals</strong></li></ul><p>Using the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any Particl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client. This introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency users.</p><p>For example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important decisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to fund using the common <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">Community Fund</a>. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about what type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and it is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.</p><p>And just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own voting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only those with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different from the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.</p><h2 id=\"multi-wallets\">Multi-wallets</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><strong>Multi-Wallets on Particl Desktop</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><em>Multi-wallets are not new to Particl.

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user accounts’ that are completely independent from each other.</p><p>Multi-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet is entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data (purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a wallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that two wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner of the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address already identified as belonging to that user.</p><p>Multi-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace, seller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the wallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

Then, on the 26th of July\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60?source=collection_home---4------3-----------------------]\n, a contest was initiated to make it more fun — every participant would win a\nfree limited edition Particl t-shirt as well as the chance to win one of 3 free\nTrezor hardware devices that the Particl team is giving away.\n\nIt can now be reported that a whopping 47 sets of Market Keys\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls] have been submitted during\nthat period! The submission period was scheduled to end today, on the 5th of\nAugust, at 14:00:00 UTC.

Now’s the time to let people know\nwhat set of Market Keys you want to see used as the default keys for the main\ninterface of the Particl Open Marketplace. In order to make the voting process\nas accessible as possible, we’re taking the process over two different\nplatforms: Particl’s Twitter page and the Particl community forum.\n\nThe first thing you’ll need to do before voting is opening Github to the pull\nrequest page of particl-market. This is where you’ll see all of the Market Key\nsubmissions. Then, simply have a look at the keys and note down the number of\nthe pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you want to submit. Once\nthat’s done, either head over to Twitter or the Particl community forum and cast\nyour vote! The voting period will end on the 8th of August at 4:00:00 (UTC).\n\n> Note: You can only pick Market Keys that have been submitted before the end of\nthe contest. That means you can only vote for pull request #406 to #458.\nTwitter\nVoting on Twitter isn’t really complicated. Simply click the link below to be\nredirected to the tweet used for the voting process, and write in the comment\nsection the number of the pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you’d\nlike to see win this contest. Make sure that the number of the pull request is\nclearly identified.\n\n> \nParticl Community Forum\nTo vote on the forum, simply click on the link below to be redirected to the\nthread used for the voting process and register your vote by writing the number\nof the pull request associated with the set of keys you want to win in the\ncomment section of the thread. If you do not have an account yet, the process of\ncreating one is fairly straight-forward.\n\nMarket Key Voting Thread\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\nOn the 17th of July, it was announced that the community could start creating\nand submitting sets of Market Keys on…\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]particl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\n\n> Note: You can vote on both Twitter and the Particl community forum. In that\ncase, you will be casting two votes and both will be registered.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrizes and How to Claim Them\nAside from being a big part of Particl’s history, there is no prize associated\nwith winning this contest. That’s because the Particl team wants people to vote\nwith their heart and to reduce the number of fraudulent votes.\n\nHowever, everyone that has submitted a set of Market Keys gets a free limited\nedition Particl t-shirt as well as the chance to win one of the three (3) free\nTrezor hardware wallets being given away.\n\nTrezor Winners\nThe three lucky community members who will walk out of this contest with one of\nthe three (3) free Trezor hardware wallets being given away will be announced on\nthe 8th of August, briefly after the voting period for the Market Keys end.\nWinners will be picked at random and will be announced on Twitter as well as on\nParticl’s chat platforms (Discord, Telegram, and Riot). Additionally, the\nwinners will be notified about it right from their pull request on Github as a\ncomment coming from Cryptoguard. Good luck everyone!\n\nClaim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, head over to Particl’s community forum by following the\nlink below and register using the Github application. Then, go to Cryptoguard’s\nprofile (https://particl.community/u/Cryptoguard/summary) and send him a message\nwith the physical address you want to receive your prize(s).\n\nClaiming your prize(s) and giving away your physical address is entirely\noptional. All addresses will be deleted from our systems a few weeks after the\nprizes are all shipped (so that we can assist you in case of shipping issues).\n\n> Note: You must submit your physical address with an account logged in through\nthe Github login app of the Particl forum. This ensures that you are the right\nperson submitting the address and not an impersonator.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Key-Generation-Contest-Voting-Period/1-QOoDlouL2J6BFxbBkS-YDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-time-to-vote\">It’s Time to Vote</h3><p>On the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-second-anniversary-91e878efa3c0\">17th of July</a>, it was announced that the community could start creating and submitting sets of Market Keys on Github so that they could be used as the default keys for the main interface of the wallet.

This build allows you to test the\nnewly introduced “anon” escrow. This escrow system makes all marketplace\ntransactions private-by-default thanks to a combination of the CT and RingCT\nprivacy protocols. This testnet build also contains a vast range of tweaks that\nhave been made to the user interface since the last testnet round.\n\nTo ensure that the code is as stable as it can be and free of any bugs, the\nParticl team is inviting you to participate in a bug bounty where you will be\nrewarded, in PART, if you find any bug within Particl Desktop and the Open\nMarketplace.\n\nSo let’s dive deeper into this bug hunting bounty!\n\n> Note: If any bug is found during this testing round, it will likely be fixed on\nthe spot in internal builds. New builds, batched with multiple bug fixes at\nonce, would then be posted throughout the duration of the bounty, meaning there\ncould potentially be more than one build published during the duration of this\nbug bounty. Reported bugs can only earn you a bounty payment if they’re being\nreported on the latest build publicly available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCatching Bugs\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple:\n\nLatest build version + location of the Report Bug button * Download the latest testnet build of the Open Marketplace. While there is a\n   working testnet version available here\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/], newer builds with\n   fixed bugs may be posted in the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org]. Always verify that\n   you are running the latest build by checking the #testing channel first.\n * Make a backup of your\n   configuration files, especially wallet.dat.\n * Run it on a clean\n   install (delete all your testnet configuration folders, including\n   Particl/testnet, Particl Desktop/testnet, and Particl Market). Please make\n   sure to backup any mainnet wallet.dat file you have before you do.\n * Report any bug or\n   issue by clicking on the bug icon on Particl Desktop. This will take you to\n   Particl Desktop’s Issue page on Github. Users need to follow the proper\n   template that automatically fills the text field when you create a new Issue.\n\nWhat’s Considered a Bug\nA bug is an unexpected behavior that breaks functionality. It needs to prevent\nusers from using a feature to its full extent. It can also be a miscalculation,\na behavior that causes wrong amounts to be transferred, or information that’s\ndisplayed incorrectly.\n\nBugs are separated into 3 categories: minor, medium, and critical.\n\nMinor bug ($25): A minor bug is any small unexpected outcome that doesn’t break\nthe build in any significant way, but still considerably impacts the user\nexperience in a negative way. A minor bug can be annoying, but won’t prevent you\nfrom accomplishing any action within the marketplace.\n\nA good example of a minor bug could be this one here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1619\n\nMedium bug ($50): A significant bug breaks the build or prevents you from\naccomplishing a certain action. They are more than just annoyances, they prevent\nyou from doing an action.\n\nAn example of what a medium bug could look like would be not being able to add\nan item to your cart, prices of items not showing up on any listing or a button\nthat wouldn’t do anything upon clicking on it.\n\nMajor bug ($100): A critical bug is a major issue that not only breaks the build\nand prevents you from accomplishing a task, but that also could result in a loss\nof funds or an incorrectly transferred amount.\n\nAn example of what a major bug could look like would be if the escrow system\nbreaks up and becomes unusable or sends the wrong amounts to the wrong users.\n\nNOTE: The Particl team has sole discretion over what level a bug is categorized\ninto. While the criteria are clear about what makes a bug a minor, medium, or\ncritical one, some bugs may not be as clear cut. In that scenario, Particl\ndevelopers will determine its level.\n\nWhat’s NOT Considered a Bug\nAlthough you may encounter issues, not all of them are considered as bugs. These\nissues may include:\n\n * A typo\n * An improvement suggestion\n * A button is not perfectly aligned\n * A small visual glitch\n * A styling issue\n * A perceived need to change/add buttons\n\nHow to Report an Issue on Github\nFor a bug to qualify for a bounty payment, it has to be properly reported on the\nParticl Desktop’s Issue page on Github and use the proper template that’s\nautomatically generated when clicking on New Issue. This helps developers\nunderstand the issue more quickly and reproduce it on their end so that it can\nbe fixed more rapidly.\n\nTo access Particl Desktop’s Issue page, simply click on the Bug icon located at\nthe bottom left corner of the Particl Desktop wallet. This will automatically\ntake you to the Github page where bugs and issues get reported. Once you are\nthere, simply click the green New Issue button.

This will effectively decide what keys are going to be used once the\nfirst mainnet build of the Particl Open Marketplace will get compiled, and will\ngive Particl Desktop 2.0 its marketplace functionality.\n\nAugust 8th, 2019\nThe Particl Open Marketplace testnet bug bounty will end. The Particl developers\nwill then continue working to fix the identified bugs, if any, for the next few\nhours/days.

Because the project is now in the middle of a phase\nswitch, the Particl team is getting reshuffled to focus more on Particl adoption\nand community building. This means a few members of the team are getting new\nroles and opportunities.\n\nParticl Gets a New Community Manager\nAugust 1st also marks the day where Particl gets a new Community Manager!\nIndeed, Guillaume Benayoun, most commonly known as Ben within the Particl\ncommunity, will join the team’s ranks as Particl’s Community Manager and\nAmbassador.\n\nBen has been a very active member ever since the very beginning of Particl and\nhas almost single-handedly built the Particl FR community. Ben is also behind \nParticl’s evening of presentations at CoinHouse\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a],\nParis, which took place on the 21st of February 2019. Click the links below to\nwatch the three presentations made on this evening.\n\n * Cold Staking & Cold Staking Pools, by Guillaume Benayoun\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crzskSfKTWk]\n * The Evolution of Global eCommerce, by Lina Seiche\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQrDPzUGYaY]\n * The Role of Intermediaries in Blockchain eCommerce, by Albin Cauderlier\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfUTKTSL2-I]\n\nAs part of his new role within the Particl team, Ben will work on growing the\nmain Particl community and make it more engaging. He will ensure there is always\na team member available to answer questions, moderate the community, and keep\nthe channels clean. Additionally, he will also help on user onboarding and the\ncreation of sub-communities to drive up the adoption of the Particl Open\nMarketplace. As with any other member of the Particl communications team, he\nwill also help in a lot of other areas touching communications.\n\nCryptoguard Gets a New Role\nCryptoguard, Particl’s former Community Manager, will now assume a more strategy\nand communications-focused role within the Particl team. He will take on some of\nPaul Schmitzer’s role in managing communications and crafting the strategies\nsurrounding it. He will still be around the community and work full-time on the\nproject, but this new position will probably mean he will have a more “in the\nbackground” role. Cryptoguard has started working on these new responsibilities\na while ago, hence why getting a new Community Manager that would be entirely\nfocused on the community was necessary.\n\nPaul Schmitzer Gets a New Role\nAs part of this reshuffling on the communications team, Paul Schmitzer will take\non a more strategic and partnership-focused role, assisting Imran in doing some\nof that. Paul’s new position will be mostly focused on contacting people, help\nto form new partnerships and relationships, and managing the communications\nstrategy on a higher level.\n\nLina Seiche Leaves the Project\nLina Seiche, former Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist for Particl,\nis unfortunately leaving the project in favor of a new job offer she’s received.\nWe would like to thank Lina for her work with Particl and wish her all the best\nwith her future endeavors!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is with great excitement that we step within this final pre-mainnet phase.\nWith a few years behind our backs, it is now time to let the world know about\nthe wonders of Particl and its Open Marketplace.\n\nSo get prepared, get your computers ready for testing, and let’s revolutionize\nthe world of eCommerce together!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update/1-kxHpRkWtmo3WsOgNQlqWUg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"toward-the-mainnet-release-of-the-particl-open-marketplace\">Toward the Mainnet Release of the Particl Open Marketplace</h3><p>The gears are turning, and ever since the Market Key Generation Contest was announced on the 26th of July, the process of bringing the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet is now well in motion!</p><p>This blog post is going to be an important one — it will give you all the information you need to know about what’s coming up as well as the remaining steps before the Open Marketplace moves onto mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-road-to-mainnet\">The Road to Mainnet</h2><p>It is finally here! <strong>The Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet on the 12th of August!</strong></p><p>Ever since the 16th of July, we have entered in the final mile of the marathon that is the mainnet launch of the Particl Open Marketplace.

For those of you that have tested the marketplace on testnet before, please\n    do remember that you will need to wipe your existing marketplace database,\n    otherwise, you may encounter errors that will break your experience. The\n    location of your particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New Since Last Time?\nNew Features\n * Fully anonymous escrow support, powered by RingCT\n * Added the ability to support free shipping\n * Added text to the help sections on the buy and sell page to indicate to users\n   that their wallets need to be unlocked to process buy flow messages\n * Error message dialog for when proposal creation fails\n\nChanges to Existing Features\n * On the top bar of the listings, buy and sell pages, the available Anon\n   balance of your wallet is displayed\n * “Spendable” and “Locked” on the Overview page is now a summary of all\n   balances\n * Instead of the balance transfer label on the Overview page, the transaction\n   type is now displayed (i.e. Converted to blind)\n * Added the ability to copy the text in the console window\n\nFixed Issues & Bugs\n * Cold staking Zap functionality\n * Converting between public and private balances\n * When converting between balances and selecting the Make payment button, a\n   popup will be displayed to unlock your wallet if it is encrypted.

It was also announced that anyone\ncould start generating market keys and any of them could be submitted on Github\nto enable market capabilities on the official Particl Desktop 2.0 build.\n\nSo let’s have some fun with it!\nTo celebrate this important milestone, as well as the upcoming Trezor hardware\ndevice support for PART [https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/316],\nthe Particl team will be giving away one (1) Trezor hardware device to 3 random\npeople who submit a set of market keys of their own. On top of this, the team\nwill also be giving away one (1) free limited edition t-shirt to every\nparticipant of this contest.\n\nLet’s first understand what this contest and giveaway are all about: the\ncreation and selection of market keys to be used as the default market on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * What are Market Keys?\n * Create a Set of Market Keys\n * Submit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Contest Prizes\n * Contest Rules\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Market Keys?\nTo understand market keys, we need to refer back to the difference between user\nmarkets and the main interface of the Open Marketplace.\n\nMarket Keys are similar to PART address keys. There is a private and public key\nthat identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets\nwithin Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and\nsell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl\nOpen Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable\nby all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these\nmarkets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell\nitems on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown\nto everyone without the private key.\n\nWhen installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the\nlistings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface\nof the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate\nlistings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user\nmarkets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.\n\nThese markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into\nyour local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the\nOpen Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase,\nor moderate any listing it contains.\n\nThere isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default\ninterface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can\nbe used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only\nperceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is\na market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to\nmanually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user\nmarkets need to be manually connected to.\n\n> The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user\nmarket. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the\nmain interface. —Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/]\nAs you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nrequires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default. And\nwhile no extra step is required by the user to connect to the main interface of\nthe marketplace, this “connection” still need to be made before a new version of\nthe Open Marketplace is pushed publicly.\n\n> Note: It is not required to generate a key to use the Particl Open Marketplace.\nWhen downloading and installing Particl Desktop 2.0 or higher, it will come\npre-packaged with a market key already linked to the client.\nAnd to do just that, an entity has to generate and choose what market keys will\nbe used to host the main market of the Open Marketplace. This is where the\ncommunity comes in…\n\nHow to Generate and Submit Market Keys\nWhile the Particl team is building the Open Marketplace protocol, it doesn’t own\nor has any sort of control over the network itself. It is entirely up to the\ncommunity of users to run and govern it. That also means generating and choosing\nwhat set of market keys is going to be used to display the main interface of the\nmarketplace will be a 100% community-led process.\n\n> Note: Generating a set of market keys does not give you any special access,\npermission, or power over the market. Everyone that installs the Open\nMarketplace has equal rights and oversight over the generated market. This is\nnot a trusted setup.\nIndeed, the Particl team is inviting everyone to generate a set of market keys\nof their own and submit it on Github by creating a pull request in the\nappropriate repository. Doing so is pretty simple and straight-forward.\n\nCreate a Set of Market Keys\n * Visit this website to generate a pair of keys: \n   https://walletgenerator.net/?currency=Particl\n\n> **Even better, download the app to your local machine and follow these steps\noffline**\n * Move your cursor randomly on the screen until the website automatically gives\n   you both a public address and a private key\n * Copy both keys\n\nSubmit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Open another tab, and go to the particl-market repository on Github: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-market/\n * Log into your Github account or create a new one\n * Fork the particl-market repository by clicking the Fork button at the top\n   right corner of the page\n * Wait for the repository to fork on your account\n * Once the screen automatically updates, you should now see that you are now on \n   https://github.com/your_username/particl-market\n   [https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market] instead of \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-market\n   [https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market]\n * Scroll down a little and click on the .env.dist file\n * Edit the file by clicking on the pen icon (Edit this file) at the top right\n   corner of the text editor\n * Scroll down to line 26 and 27\n * Replace the variable on line 26 with the private key you’ve just generated:\n   DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_PRIVATE_KEY=2Zc2pc9jSx2qF5tpu25DCZEr1Dwj8JBoVL5WP4H1drJsX9sP4ek\n * Delete the # at the beginning of the line\n * Replace the variable on line 27 with the public address you’ve generated:\n   DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=pmktyVZshdMAQ6DPbbRXEFNGuzMbTMkqAA\n * Delete the # at the beginning of the line\n * Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and put Default Market Key Submission\n   as the title of the commit. There should already be a greyed out title that\n   says Update .env.dist, just overwrite it.\n * Click the green Commit changes button to save the file\n * Go back to the main particl-market folder by clicking on particl-market at\n   the top of your screen\n * Create your pull request by clicking on the small Pull request button located\n   just under the Clone or download green button on the top right corner of the\n   page\n * On the next page that shows up, make sure there is a green text that says\n   Able to merge.\n * Click on the green Create pull request button to create your pull request\n * Before officially submitting your market keys, you can add any comment or\n   message you want for the community to see in the next page that comes up.\n   This message can help the community make its choice on which market keys it\n   wants to pick\n * Click on Create pull request to officially submit your pull request, thus\n   successfully submitting your keys to be picked by the community as the\n   default market keys of the Particl Open Marketplace ?\n\nContest Prizes\n * 1 Trezor hardware device given away to 3 random people who submit market keys\n * 1 free limited edition t-shirt to every person who submits market keys\n\nContest Rules\n * Market keys submissions will be accepted until the 5th of August, 14:00:00\n   UTC\n * Community voting starts on the 5th of August and will last until the 7th of\n   August.\n * Only 1 submission per participant is allowed\n * Pull requests that are not properly submitted or contain other code\n   modifications will be ignored\n * Both line 26 and 27 need to be uncommented, meaning the line cannot start\n   with #\n\n> Correct formatting: DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=YOURKEYIncorrect formatting:\n#DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=YOURKEY\n\nHow to Vote\nThe community voting process will be held from the 5th of August to the 7th of\nAugust. To let as many people vote as possible, both Particl’s Twitter page and\nthe Particl forum will be used to collect votes. This is to ensure as many\npeople as possible can give their input on which key should be picked. More\ndetails will be announced later on.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow’s the time for you to be part of Particl’s history!

In short, \nhold funds in Anon balances and make RingCT transactions every once in a while.\n\nRingCT is a privacy protocol that becomes increasingly effective as more and\nmore people use it. This is one of the main reasons why the Particl Open\nMarketplace will make all transaction private by default using the protocol\n(more marketplace users automatically means a stronger privacy).\n\nTo help the network and support its privacy, it is recommended to leave a\nportion of your coins in Anon balances. This helps the network by providing more\noutputs that can be used by other users within their ring groups. In other\nwords, the more coins being held in Anon balances, the more outputs can be used\nby everyone else as decoys for their transactions.\n\nRingCT also gets even stronger when you make a few transactions here and there.\nThat’s because the protocol tends to prioritize recent outputs in order to \nmitigate the traceability of coins [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/].\n\nAdditionally, if you want to anonymize the coins you currently hold properly, it\nis recommended that you do multiple RingCT transactions (Anon balances to Anon \nbalances) to yourself before transferring coins held in your Anon balance back\nto your Public balance. That’s because an observer can tell the maximum size of\na recently created anon output by looking at the amounts of the non-blinded\ninputs that went into it. Alternatively, you can also wait some time after your \nPublic to Anon balance transfer so that your RingCT outputs can be used by\nvarious ring groups. That will add more possibilities, making the real origin\nmore difficult to trace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll Set for the Open Marketplace Mainnet Launch\nThe RingCT and Bulletproofs hardfork is an important step leading up to the\nrelease of the Particl Open Marketplace. As the marketplace decentralized\napplication works exclusively using Anon balances, meaning that you can only\npurchase and sell items using RingCT transactions, now is the time to start\nconverting some of your coins into Anon balances and get ready for the launch!\n\nNot only will you help the network and its privacy level, but you’ll also be\nfully ready to use the Particl Open Marketplace as soon as it comes out!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/RingCT---Bulletproofs-Now-Available-on-Mainnet/1-a6cQyigLiIO9mv6qG4r8tQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It’s official!

A\nvulnerability in either of those algorithms could allow the forging of a proof\nor a signature, which could result in money theft or creation.\n\nUltimately, the main objective was to find vulnerabilities that could allow a\nrangeproof to be bypassed, the amount of a confidential transaction to be known\nor a ring signature to be forged.\n\nApart from testing directly the code in general or just certain functions, the\nmajor part of the audit was performed statically. Because of time constraints no\nfuzzing or differential fuzzing techniques were used. The audit was mostly\nfocused on high level functions such as the proof, signature and verification\nalgorithms rather than the lower-level primitives (operations on scalars,\noperations on group elements, multi-exponentiation, etc.). —excerpt from report\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBulletproofs\n * Bulletproofs, to prove that a value is in a given range without ever needing\n   to reveal the actual value, thus preventing money creation;\n\nThe implementation chosen by Particl is based on Andrew Poelstra’s\n[https://github.com/apoelstra/secp256k1-mw] and some improvements have been made\nto it.

one on-boards two of\nthe most desired privacy and speed features for the PART currency and\necosystem — RingCT and Bulletproofs.\n\nThe significance of these tools coming to PART mainnet isn’t lost on the many of\nus in the community who have been wanting these for day-to-day use since they\nfirst appeared on PART testnet in 2017. But, for those readers curious about the\nimpact these will have in the privacy-focused, decentralized economy Particl is\nbuilding, this post will help explain a bit more.\n\nThe Most Important PART\n? This is a full hardfork.\nAfter July 16th, no nodes below 0.18.0.10 should be on the main chain. That\nmeans everyone will need to update to Particl Core v0.18.0.10 (or newer) before\n2019–07–16. For the procrastinators, you have 3 weeks!\n\nParticl Core v0.18.0.10 builds are ready now. Upgrade today!\nparticl/particl-core [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]\n\nParticl Desktop (v1.4) builds are ready now. Upgrade today!\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.4.0]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.4.0]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.4.0]\n\nImportant: Same as Particl Core wallet, users who haven’t updated to Particl\nDesktop (v1.4) or later by July 16th will NOT be on the main chain after the\nfork. We will send out another reminder 7–10 days ahead of July 16th to remind\nusers to update. Particl Desktop builds will be included in that reminder post.\n\n⭐️ For most users, the only important piece of information is summarized above. \nWe do have more details about Particl Core development included in this post.\nFor those interested to learn more, please, continue reading!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardfork Details\nThere are actually 2 hardforks coming to Particl in July— one for testnet, one\nfor mainnet.\n\n2019-07-01 12:00:00 UTC on testnet, hardfork to enable variable smsg difficulty.\n\n2019-07-16 12:00:00 UTC on mainnet, hardfork to enable ringCT transactions and\nbulletproofs.\n\nRelease notes: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.18/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01810\n\n? Testnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.01–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nSMSG variable difficulty gives the network a way to disable free smsg messages\nif someone starts spamming. By design, each free smsg has to hash in a certain\nway (like PoW). This makes the difficulty variable as opposed to hard-coded.\n\n? Mainnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.16–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable bulletproof rangeproofs.\n * Enable RingCT transactions.\n * Enable variable fee rate for smsg paid messages.\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nBulletproof rangeproofs are a much more efficient rangeproof than what has been\non the network to date. When we launched Particl with Confidential Transactions\n(CT) in 2017 a major difficulty was the size of blind transactions compared to \npublic transactions. CT transactions typically are 20x larger than non-CT\ntransactions. Bulletproofs can allow doubling the range size while still\nreducing transactions sizes by 65% or more.\n\n> Bulletproofs are much more general than rangeproofs. They can be used to prove,\nin zero knowledge, arbitrary statements. They are equivalent in power to SNARKs\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/507] or STARKs [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046],\nbut have native support for elliptic curve (EC) public keys and Pedersen\ncommitments (so there is typically no need to implement EC math inside a program\nbeing proven). Also, unlike SNARKs, Bulletproofs have full 128-bit security\nunder standard assumptions with no trusted setup. Unlike STARKs, they are fast\nenough to prove and verify reasonably-sized problems on typical computing\nhardware. —Andrew Poelstra\n[https://blockstream.com/2018/02/21/en-bulletproofs-faster-rangeproofs-and-much-more/]\nRingCT transactions are unlinkable and untraceable onchain transactions. RingCT\nis short for Ring Confidential Transactions. First described\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] by Shen Noether of XMR Labs, Particl’s\nversion is a complete ground-up build on the current Bitcoin codebase (0.18) by\nour very talented Lead Core developer Tecnovert.\n\n> For the record, this whole development update is directly tied to the phenomenal\nwork Tecnovert builds into Particl Core.

With this, the Awareness Campaign is now resumed\n[https://friends.particl.community], with sign up payouts disabled, so that you\ncan continue earning staking shares by referring your friends to Particl. When\nyou reach 12 points, you will earn your first staking share. Each additional\npoint will reward you with a staking share.\n\nFor more details, read our latest blog post on the Awareness Campaign by\nfollowing this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-awareness-campaign-update-d94347324121\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe announced a few days before the NYC Blockchain Week that we were launching an\nawareness campaign to get more people to know about Particl. While we expected\nthe campaign to reach a few hundred people, it blew up and went viral overnight,\nreaching the hidden payouts cap that had been set up for the campaign in just a\nfew hours.\n\nWith the first payouts being initially scheduled for today, we’d like to thank\neverybody that has participated in the campaign so for and keep you updated on\nthe status of the campaign and let you know what comes next!\n\nThe Campaign Goes Viral\nThis awareness campaign was initially designed to be a grassroots initiative to\nget friends to know about Particl and its Open Marketplace. Little did we know,\nthe campaign became viral in a matter of mere hours and was shared within many\nmassive airdrop and signup groups, creating a rapid influx of participants\novernight.\n\nAwareness Campaign Stats\n * Number of registered participants: 16,944\n * Number of participants automatically detected as fraudulent: 6,657\n * Number of Particl Desktop downloads during campaign: ~2,000\n * Hidden payouts cap reached after: ~16 hours\n * Number of participants that qualify for staking shares: 105\n\nCircumventing Fraud\nBecause we did not expect this campaign to get as viral as it did, and so\nrapidly, we’ve been surprised by the huge amount of fraudulent participation\nwe’ve received. Luckily, the platform we’re using to run the campaign was set up\nto automatically flag fraudulent emails based on various criteria. In total, the\nsystem flagged 6,657 fake emails based on a wide variety of criteria, excluding\nthese participants from the campaign.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve been running our own script to find any other fraudulent\nemail that would bypass the platform’s filter. In the end, it turns out that \nonly ~1,800 participants have properly followed all the steps required by the\ncampaign, a figure that matches closely the approximate number of unique Particl\nDesktop downloads.\n\nCampaign Status\nThe fraud attempts have required more time to sort out than expected. We also\nwanted to take off as many fake participants as possible in order to keep the\ncontest fair for the honest participants.\n\nTo make that process easier, we temporarily paused the campaign until we could\nbuild scripts that would be able to automatically filter large amounts of emails\nand private addresses and get them sorted on a database so that we could process\npayouts more effectively.\n\nAs such, we still need a bit of time before processing payment, a process that\nwill probably extend over the next few days.\n\nWhen Will I Receive my Payout?\nIf you qualify for the signup payouts, don’t worry, it is normal that you\nhaven’t received anything yet. You should be receiving your payment within the\nnext few hours/days. You won’t need to do anything special to claim your PART,\nit will simply eventually show up on your Overview page as an incoming\ntransaction!\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for payouts:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Complete the steps above before the hidden payout cap is reached (within the\n   first 16 hours of the campaign)\n\nIf you also qualify for staking shares, meaning that you at least got 10 of your\nfriends to sign up with Particl, you should also receive your first payment\nshortly.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for staking shares:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Get more than 10 friends to sign up with Particl\n\nWhat We’ve Learned From this Campaign\nThis campaign has had good results — Particl Desktop has been downloaded around\n2,000 times during this campaign. After all, the goal was to get users playing\naround with crypto’s best-looking wallet!\n\nBut it is also very clear that the system has been abused to a bigger extent\nthan we expected it to be. Nearly 17,000 people participated, but there were\nonly around 2,000 unique downloads of Particl Desktop and around 1,800\nparticipants that went through the campaign’s steps properly. That means that,\nright out of the bat, around 15,000 (~88%) participants haven’t properly gone\nthrough the process of qualifying for payouts.\n\nThis has been a good experiment that has brought valuable insight as to how to\nimprove future awareness campaigns and how to sustain larger degrees of\nparticipation. We look forward to initiating similar campaigns in the future by\nusing the goods, without the bads, of this awareness campaign.\n\nWhat Now?\nOnce the first payouts will be paid, we will resume the Awareness Campaign as\nplanned. Remember, now that the hidden payouts cap has been reached after only\n16 hours into the campaign, the only reward for signing up with Particl will be\nthe staking shares earned once you get more than 10 of your friends to sign up\nas well.\n\nKeep your eyes close to your Particl Desktop wallet. Once you receive your\npayment, the Awareness Campaign will resume and you’ll be able to start earning\npoints again by getting your friends to sign up on \nhttps://friends.particl.community/.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe would like to thank everyone that has participated in the campaign so far and\nwish you the best luck in your hunt for staking shares!\n\nIf you have any question regarding the Awareness Campaign, join our Particl\nAwareness Telegram channel by following this link: https://t.me/particlawareness\n.\n\nTo read the announcement post for the campaign, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/announcement-particl-awareness-campaign-464baa8477b5\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Awareness-Campaign-Update/1-0aizM4VoRA47jkDdp0fdDA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><hr><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The sign up payouts for the Awareness Campaign have been executed earlier today.

us, now is the time to entirely focus on the\nmainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nIn a progress update posted on Discord on the 1st of May, we’ve mentioned that\nthe team was pretty much done with the integration of the blind escrow and was\nrunning automated tests on the OMP Library integration.\n\nIf you would like to read the other parts of this Community Update, simply\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * NYC Blockchain Week Recap\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-2-f4ca972abed0]\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Mainnet Release Timeline\nSince Particl has updated its core to 0.18 just 13 days ago\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7], we would like\nto let you know exactly where we currently stand, what’s the current projected\nmainnet release timeline, and what to look out for in the next few days!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Marketplace Mainnet Release Roadmap\n * (1) Finish blind escrow integration (Done)\n * (2) Finish the OMP Library integration tests (In progress)\n * (3) Tweak Particl Desktop to integrate the OMP Library (Pending) -> ETA: 1–2\n   days\n * (4) Publish final testnet build to the community before mainnet release \n   (Pending) -> ETA: Approximately 1 week if all goes smoothly\n * (5) Mainnet release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinish the Blind Escrow Integration (Done)\nDuring the last few weeks, the team had the opportunity to integrate the blind\nescrow in full and make a series of critical tweaks to the OMP Library just\nbefore releasing the marketplace on mainnet. The OMP Library was written some\ntime ago by Particl’s developer Kewde, but the team wanted to make some\nmodifications to it and run proper testing, specifically related to the buy\nflow, before putting it onto mainnet.\n\nThe OMP Library is a major improvement to the backend of the Particl Open\nMarketplace, allowing for example escrows to process transactions automatically\nusing Confidential Transactions or for listings to have more attributes.\n\nWe are happy to say that the integration of the blind escrow system into the\nmarketplace is now complete.\n\nFinish the OMP Library Integration Tests (In Progress)\nThe next step is to finalize the OMP Library integration by running the whole\nsuite of automated tests the team has built over the last two years. These\nautomated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break\nthem in any possible way.\n\nWhen a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be\nupdated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until\nit finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results,\nwe would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until\nafter these tests are complete.\n\nWe initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC\nBlockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the\nconferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead\nMarketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open\nMarketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason\nwhy we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it\nback home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the\nfinal testnet build before the first mainnet release.\n\nNote that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To\nthe contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a\nmajority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a\nclear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We\nactually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will\ncommunicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.\n\nWhy are These Tests so Important?\nThese automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes\nParticl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put\nout in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it\nis as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.\n\nThe tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components.\nIn fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved\nonto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there\nwill always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a\nhuge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the\nsecurity of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while\nit’s on the track racing.\n\nTake the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the\nseller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds\nlocked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that\ncould potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can\nimagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet\nenvironment!\n\n> Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track\nracing. — Joe Fisher\nThat doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after\nit launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time\nconsuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and\nare fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of\ntesting before unleashing on mainnet.\n\nThis is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet\nrelease.\n\nIntegrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)\nOnce the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate\nthe last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick\nto complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the\nbackend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works\nflawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the\nintegration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to\nParticl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy\nflow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.\n\nLast Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)\nAs soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the\ncommunity, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release\nof the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nBecause the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few\nmonths, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the\nimportant thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as\nthey will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being\nreleased on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.\n\nNevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet\nclient before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be\nrunning a short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500\nworth of PART to the best bug hunters out there! We will reveal all of the\ndetails once we publish the testnet build.\n\nWe estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a\nduration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard\ndate, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major\nissue arises.\n\nThen, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live\non mainnet will be upon us!\n\nMainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\nThis is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open\nMarketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto\nmainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with\nreal funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet\nrun of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.\n\nSo When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?\nAt this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that\nthe tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed\nwithin a pretty short time frame of a few days, though. Then, once it’s done, 1\nto 2 days will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last\ntestnet will be released to the public for a period of approximately 1 week, if\nall goes smoothly. We definitely want and will communicate a more precise\ntimeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library\nintegration tests. However, this development update should still be able to give\nyou a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.\n\nIn the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at\nthe Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to maximize the exposure of\nthe mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in\nlight of the new contacts we’ve made.\n\nAfter nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there! All\nfeatures intended to be part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nhave been integrated and are going through their final automated testing rounds.\nAlthough we are not able to give a definitive date for the mainnet release\ntoday, we will be communicating one very shortly.\n\nHang tight because from here on out, things will get very interesting!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews Flash: Particl Bulletproofs Audit by Quarkslab\nOn a non-marketplace related note, we are pleased to announce that Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] has started auditing our Bitcoin-based\nBulletproofs integration. Quarkslab is a world-renowned security firm having\naudited codes and projects like OpenSSL\n[https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/], \nVeraCrypt\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/veracrypt-audit-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities,32878.html]\n, OpenVPN [https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-assessment-of-openvpn.html], and,\ninterestingly enough, Monero’s Bulletproofs implementation\n[https://blokt.com/news/monero-fixes-all-bulletproof-protocol-vulnerabilities-found-in-second-security-audit]\n.\n\nOnce the audit is done, we’ll look into the report, address any potential issue\nit identifies, and start planning ahead for a hardfork of Particl’s RingCT with\nBulletproofs on mainnet.\n\nWe will keep you informed as details come in!\n\nWelcome — Quarkslab [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\nEvery security issue is different, every solution must be\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]www.quarkslab.com [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming up?\nWith all the intended features for the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nbeing integrated, part of the development team has now started working on the\nnext features that will be integrated into the marketplace. Note that none of\nthese new features will be included in the first mainnet version of the Open\nMarketplace. As the build is pretty stable right now, we do not want to\nintegrate new functions that could delay the mainnet release.\n\nQuantity Management\nA must-have for vendors running a business out of their sales. Quantity\nManagement is like a lite version of the full Inventory Management system we\nplan on integrating later during the Beta phase of development. It allows\nvendors to set quantities for their listings and lets people bid multiple times\non the same listings if the vendors set their quantity accordingly.\n\nFuture Features\nThe Particl team also has other features it would like to focus on first after\nthe mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. We still want to go through a few\nother development meeting sessions before communicating what other features\nother than Quantity Management will be worked on first. We will let you know all\nof the information after the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the Development Update part of this Community Update.

Week\nLast week, the Particl team met in New York City to participate in the NYC\nBlockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events] by\nhaving a booth at both the Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus. There, the\nteam demonstrated the long-awaited Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet, for the\nfirst time ever and was able to make a huge leap forward by connecting directly\nwith the crypto community.\n\nToward the Particl Open Marketplace\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nThe coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one. Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for…\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\n\nIf you would like to read about Part 1 and Part 3 of this Community Update, then\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * Development Update\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-3-4d53bcf621af]\n\nMagical Crypto Conference\nThe team’s first stop was at the Magical Crypto Conference\n[https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/], an event organized by the “magical\nfriends” — Charlie Lee, Samson Mow, Ricardo Spagni, and WhalePanda. In\ncomparison to Consensus, MCC aims to be the go-to conference for the true crypto\nfans and cypherpunks. It is an environment that is safe from all the corporate\ninfluence of Consensus and focuses on the tech moving forward. And magical it\nwas…\n\nDay 1 of MCC was Particl’s cupcake day. In fact, Particl saw its first\nsuccessful marketplace transaction take place on mainnet\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1127237342920675328]! This is an enormous\nmilestone for the project and it really started the week on the right foot,\nespecially as the whole process happened very smoothly and without any hiccup.\n\nBecause this event was mostly attended by long-time Bitcoin fans and people who\ngenerally don’t like the whole corporate/altcoin aspect of Consensus, we\nexpected to be met with skepticism and be put on the spot. However, we were\npleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl\nOpen Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the\nbooth.\n\nMax Keiser at the Particl boothUsually, most people don’t like when a platform\nis exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has\nproven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its\nnative coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain\nprivate, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to.\nThe ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform\nintended to be used by all crypto users.\n\nOne of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest\nfrom the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all,\nthe first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto\nusers, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.\n\nWe can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors,\ndevelopers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore\ncrypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable\nfeedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to\nshowcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical\nCrypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure\nand is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!\n\nConsensus\nWhereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know\nabout the Open Marketplace, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] meant business!\n\nAs you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty\nexpensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping\n$1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people,\nmaking the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This\nactually turned out to be a good thing.\n\nLike many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the\nprevious edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing\naround for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a\nsour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical\nCrypto Conference was created in the first place.\n\nSmaller but Better Crowd\nThis year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The\nquality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts\nand figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto\nfans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives,\nmany team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all\nresulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain\nsolutions could disrupt their respective industries.\n\nAnd as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team.\nIt has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major\nvendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a\ntrustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact,\nwe have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of\nParticl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their\nbusinesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with\nthem.\n\nDisrupting of Supply Chains\nParticl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers\nand vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what\nsome of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that\nthe Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow\nsystem, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how\nsupply chains operate in a major way.\n\nThe Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by\ngetting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely\nmoving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various\napplications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply\nchains, hiding R&D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading\ngoods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.\n\nFrom all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed\nto be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the\nOpen Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely\navoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely\ngroundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.\n\nSeeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one\nof the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.\n\nGreat Connections\nAside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve\nhad quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the\nspace, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it\nless chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.\n\nWe are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and\nwe’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors\nthat have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.\n\nInsights Right From the Trenches\nNot only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those\ndiscussions have also been extremely insightful to the team. The fact that so\nmany people came with so many different backgrounds and areas of expertise, it\ngave us a lot of different perspectives and ways to see how Particl’s Open\nMarketplace could be used in real-life situations. Suffice to say, the potential\nof this marketplace extends much further than just being a cool marketplace for\ncrypto users.\n\nNYC Blockchain Week Recap\nThe NYC Blockchain Week may very well turn out to be a very impactful event for\nParticl. The Particl team is coming back home with a strong sense of mission\naccomplished. We’ve had the opportunity to meet with so many of the users we’re\nbuilding this platform for, collect a vast amount of feedback from them and get\ndecent exposure in the heart of crypto.\n\nThe whole team that attended the conferences feels like this entire week has\nbeen a solid validation of what we’ve known all along — Particl is a highly\ndisruptive marketplace that looks and feels right. The only difference now is\nthat we’ve met some of the very people that need this marketplace the most, and\nwe are all as motivated and optimistic about the future of this project as we’ve\never been!\n\nA Rare Working Blockchain Product\nOnce again, just like the few recent conferences we’ve attended, Particl seemed\nto be among the minority of booths with a working product on display. This was\nsomething that impressed a lot of people.\n\nSometimes, the booth would be so busy that you would need to explain Particl a\nbit further away from the computers. Then, when the person would ask for a video\ndemo, they’d be completely surprised to learn that we actually had a working\nversion of it on mainnet just a few meters away. This was a reaction we’ve seen\ntime and time again, people are still not used to the fact that a blockchain\nproduct could be live on mainnet, and look so damn good.\n\nBest Testing Ground\nOne very interesting aspect of our week in NYC was the fact that for the entire\nduration of the two conferences we’ve attended, the Particl Open Marketplace has\nbeen thoroughly tested on mainnet and under many different circumstances. We\nhave observed no issue whatsoever, and we feel very confident moving forward\nwith this product.\n\nWhat Now?\nWe want to continue traveling the world and keep reaching out to more people.\nWe’ve also made great friendships and connections with people in the space with\nwhom we want to keep spending time with. This is the reason why we’ll actively\nbe looking around at other conferences and keep an eye out for any interesting\nevent.\n\nAs such, we likely will have a few team members going to San Francisco on the\n25th and 26th of June for the Bitcoin2019 conference\n[https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/]. We will announce more details shortly,\nbut if you are planning on going as well, definitely drop us a message and let’s\ntry to meet up at the conference!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the NYC Blockchain Week Recap part of this Community Update.

However, we were pleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl Open Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the booth.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-EfxiVhuXxFqWGObfPo_PWA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Max Keiser at the Particl booth</figcaption></figure><p>Usually, most people don’t like when a platform is exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has proven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its native coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain private, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to. The ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform intended to be used by all crypto users.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-Pav2psmSB0_-bZa0z8pRQw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>One of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest from the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all, the first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto users, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.</p><p>We can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors, developers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore crypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable feedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to showcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical Crypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure and is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!</p><h2 id=\"consensus\">Consensus</h2><p>Whereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know about the Open Marketplace, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019\"><strong>Consensus</strong></a> meant business!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-nARXbCJNMcUjiJmrCPgKWQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty expensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping $1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people, making the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This actually turned out to be a good thing.</p><p>Like many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the previous edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing around for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a sour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical Crypto Conference was created in the first place.</p><h3 id=\"smaller-but-better-crowd\">Smaller but Better Crowd</h3><p>This year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The quality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts and figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto fans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives, many team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all resulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain solutions could disrupt their respective industries.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-voIPMRhL2RfDNElVliA1gg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>And as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team. It has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major vendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a trustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact, we have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of Particl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their businesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with them.</p><h3 id=\"disrupting-of-supply-chains\">Disrupting of Supply Chains</h3><p>Particl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers and vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what some of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that the Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow system, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how supply chains operate in a major way.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-I9y28fq0kQ51wJolPi9_SQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by getting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely moving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various applications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply chains, hiding R&#x26;D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading goods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.</p><p>From all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed to be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the Open Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely avoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely groundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.</p><p>Seeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one of the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.</p><h3 id=\"great-connections\">Great Connections</h3><p>Aside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve had quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the space, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it less chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.</p><p>We are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and we’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors that have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.</p><h3 id=\"insights-right-from-the-trenches\">Insights Right From the Trenches</h3><p>Not only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those discussions have also been extremely insightful to the team. The fact that so many people came with so many different backgrounds and areas of expertise, it gave us a lot of different perspectives and ways to see how Particl’s Open Marketplace could be used in real-life situations. Suffice to say, the potential of this marketplace extends much further than just being a cool marketplace for crypto users.</p><h2 id=\"nyc-blockchain-week-recap-1\">NYC Blockchain Week Recap</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-kklvFWzk6Lnrc3O84nW5tw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The NYC Blockchain Week may very well turn out to be a very impactful event for Particl. <strong>The Particl team is coming back home with a strong sense of mission accomplished.</strong> We’ve had the opportunity to meet with so many of the users we’re building this platform for, collect a vast amount of feedback from them and get decent exposure in the heart of crypto.</p><p>The whole team that attended the conferences feels like this entire week has been a solid validation of what we’ve known all along — Particl is a highly disruptive marketplace that looks and feels right. The only difference now is that we’ve met some of the very people that need this marketplace the most, and we are all as motivated and optimistic about the future of this project as we’ve ever been!</p><h3 id=\"a-rare-working-blockchain-product\">A Rare Working Blockchain Product</h3><p>Once again, just like the few recent conferences we’ve attended, Particl seemed to be among the minority of booths with a working product on display. This was something that impressed a lot of people.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-MTndfC0uAEaLX8b4w9Re5A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Sometimes, the booth would be so busy that you would need to explain Particl a bit further away from the computers. Then, when the person would ask for a video demo, they’d be completely surprised to learn that we actually had a working version of it on mainnet just a few meters away. This was a reaction we’ve seen time and time again, people are still not used to the fact that a blockchain product could be live on mainnet, and look so damn good.</p><h3 id=\"best-testing-ground\">Best Testing Ground</h3><p>One very interesting aspect of our week in NYC was the fact that for the entire duration of the two conferences we’ve attended, the Particl Open Marketplace has been thoroughly tested on mainnet and under many different circumstances. We have observed no issue whatsoever, and we feel very confident moving forward with this product.</p><h3 id=\"what-now\">What Now?</h3><p>We want to continue traveling the world and keep reaching out to more people. We’ve also made great friendships and connections with people in the space with whom we want to keep spending time with. This is the reason why we’ll actively be looking around at other conferences and keep an eye out for any interesting event.</p><p>As such, we likely will have a few team members going to <a href=\"https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/\"><strong>San Francisco on the 25th and 26th of June for the Bitcoin2019 conference</strong></a>. We will announce more details shortly, but if you are planning on going as well, definitely drop us a message and let’s try to meet up at the conference!</p><hr><p>This concludes the NYC Blockchain Week Recap part of this Community Update.
