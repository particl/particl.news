This is a Particl Desktop specific change.\n\nFlagging Markets\nFlagging markets (markets that the user has either flagged or voted on to\nremove) prevents the processing of activities that the flagged market impacts.\nExamples are attempting to remove the market, editing categories on the market,\nor creating and editing listings for that market.\n\nSome of the issues that were previously causing problems have been fixed.\nHowever, there are still issues that need to be fixed up. This is a market\nback-end specific change.\n\nExpired Listings\nExpired listings that are still in a cart should not be removed when the MP\nroutine to clean up expired listings automatically is run. This is a market\nback-end specific change that’s completed and only requires to be merged.\n\nTo Be Completed\nThe following items are placed in the order that they are planned to be worked\non.\n\nOrders Getting Stuck in Shipping Phase\nIn the buy flow, releasing funds to complete the buy flow for an item before a\npossible shipping message has been received results in the order status becoming\nstuck in the 'Shipping' state despite being complete. This is a market back-end\nspecific change that is likely already fixed but requires a bit more testing.\n\nMiscellaneous Client Startup Issue\nHad a report that starting the client with a locked wallet results in some\nstartup issues (unlocking the wallet and starting the market app again appears\nto have fixed it). This is a Particl Desktop specific fix, and it still requires\nfurther investigation.\n\nDynamic Quotations\nThis is not a bug but an intended addition to Particl V3. Add dynamic quotations\ninto the Particl Desktop startup splash screen. This is a Particl Desktop\nspecific change.\n\nWindows Startup Bug\nA zmq.node error causes startup issues for some Windows users. The issue makes\nlaunching and properly using Particl V3 impossible for these users. This is a\nParticl Desktop specific change.\n\nDelete a Product From the Inventory\nThis is not a bug but an intended addition to Particl V3. This will let you\ndelete products from your inventory if you don’t want them to be displayed\nanymore. This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end specific change.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce at least all the above items, except the last two (the Windows issue and\nthe product deletion), are complete, we should be ready to release the next\ntestnet release candidate for Particl V3.\n\nIn the meantime, don’t miss Particl’s upcoming CCS votes for the election of\noutput claim managers and the introduction of a new decentralized treasury\nmodel. The first vote is going to take place on Wednesday, the 12th of May,\n2021. You can find the details of the proposal here.\n[https://particl.news/delegated-output-claim-management-proposal/]\n\nAs always, we want to thank you for your continued support!

for a brand new, more community-focused approach.\n\nAs you would expect, such an important shift requires a lot of work to be done\ninternally and structurally, which doesn’t always show up publicly until a later\ntime. The good news, though, is that this “later time” has come, and a lot of\nwhat’s been in the works in that regard has started to surface in April. You can\nexpect the month of May to be the same, only at a more accentuated level.\n\nThis update will recap all the major events and developments that have happened\nlast month.

This shift aims at putting you, every\ncommunity member, into a more important position of power over what happens with\nthe project.\n\nAs such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing\nhow the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain\nvoting tool and the CCS proposal system.\n\nThe on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the\nblockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on\nthe CCS.\n\nIf you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the\nParticl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on\nby the community.\n\nFor all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in\nwith the CCS system, check out this blog post available on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/].\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]To\nempower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance\nmodel, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model\nthat could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.\n\nThis decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in\nthe coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to\n8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other\n50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.\n\nThe Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft\nproposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit\nthe Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the\ntreasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the\non-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.\n\nIn May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post\nexplaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds\nfrom the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose,\nand so on. Keep your eyes peeled on Particl News for when that blog post lands.\n\nFirst Proposal to Require a Vote Now Live on the CCS\nDelegated Output Claim Management by cryptoguard · Pull Request #7 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal is to implement a streamlined and\nmore\nefficient way to process manual output claims and reactivate temporarily\ndisabled anon and blind balances.RationaleOn the 25th of Febr...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7]April also saw the first CCS\nproposal ever to require an on-chain community vote to be activated. Indeed,\ncreated out of firm community feedback, the Delegated Output Claim Management\nProposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7] suggests nominating a\ngroup composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate\nindividual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. \n\nOnce validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one\ncomposed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This\nsecond group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no\nclaim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.\n\nIt seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire\nmethod to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon\nthe assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.\n\nThis proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for\nvoting in the next few days. If you have any questions or comments, you can\nvisit the AMA/FAQ thread dedicated to this proposal on Reddit by following this\nlink\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/n0ld5d/amafaq_delegated_output_claim_management_proposal/]\n.\n\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nNew Particl Releases and V3 Progress ReportDownload and install the new Particl\nDesktop and Core releases and get up to speed with the latest Particl V3\nprogress report.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-releases-and-v3-progress-report/]As Particl V3\nnears completion for its mainnet release, a development progress report has been\npublished during April.

This shift aims at putting you, every community member, into a more important position of power over what happens with the project.</p><p>As such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing how the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain voting tool and the CCS proposal system.</p><p>The on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the blockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on the CCS.</p><p>If you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the Particl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on by the community.</p><p>For all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in with the CCS system, check out <a href=\"https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/\"><strong>this blog post available on Particl News</strong></a>.</p><h1 id=\"decentralized-treasury-model\">Decentralized Treasury Model</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about the new CCS proposal to form a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Blog</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/d61e2b944bf46e43f071527ffeff4776/medium-particl-treasury.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>To empower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance model, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model that could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.</p><p>This decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in the coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to 8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other 50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.</p><p>The Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft proposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the treasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the on-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.</p><p>In May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post explaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds from the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose, and so on. Keep your eyes peeled on Particl News for when that blog post lands.</p><h1 id=\"first-proposal-to-require-a-vote-now-live-on-the-ccs\">First Proposal to Require a Vote Now Live on the CCS</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Delegated Output Claim Management by cryptoguard · Pull Request #7 · particl/ccs-proposals</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">SummaryThis proposal is to implement a streamlined and more efficient way to process manual output claims and reactivate temporarily disabled anon and blind balances.RationaleOn the 25th of Febr...</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">GitHub</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">particl</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/66eab0d12a30e80e5fdcaf52f7abca9b7074708cbeaf6ea0405b6aa1809cb505/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7\"></div></a></figure><p>April also saw the first CCS proposal ever to require an on-chain community vote to be activated. Indeed, created out of firm community feedback, the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7\">Delegated Output Claim Management Proposal</a> suggests nominating a group composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate individual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. </p><p>Once validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one composed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This second group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no claim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.</p><p>It seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire method to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon the assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.</p><p>This proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for voting in the next few days.

Not only will it provide more resilience against the power exchanges hold over Particl, but it’ll also make acquiring PART easier, more accessible, and entirely anonymous. An integration of BasicSwap into Particl Desktop is planned and is currently in progress (more details on that in a later Particl News blog post).</p><p>As development continues, BasicSwap will soon be opened for testing as a public beta. Stay vigilant as it will be announced on Particl News when ready.</p><hr><p>Get prepared for May as things are about to lift for Particl.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
