Indeed, in the\ncoming few weeks, Particl will be attending 5 conferences at various places and\nwill use the opportunity provided by the media and key people present at these\nevents to announce exciting news.\n\nYou may have noticed that, as of late, the Particl team has been a bit more\nquiet than usual. That’s because they’ve been preparing the grounds for a wider\nadoption of the marketplace by working on some very concrete solutions that will\nmake using it as easy as it’s ever been! Particl is indeed deciding to focus\nheavily on user adoption by providing the tools and simplicity the network needs\nto thrive and develop a real economy around its ecosystem. This “Particl World\nTour” series of conferences that’s coming within the next few days is when those\nsolutions will start being revealed. And the gears are already turning!\n\nThe announcements that are coming up for the project will likely change\nParticl’s game and kickstart the adoption of its network in significant ways.\nSome of the solutions being worked on at the moment are expected to be major\ndrivers for adoption and aim at bringing many transactions per day on the\nParticl blockchain. It’s definitely got the entire team buzzing!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Events is Particl Attending?\nParticl will fully leverage the exposure and opportunities provided by the 5\nupcoming conferences it will be attending in the next few weeks to reveal and\nlet the blockchain space know about what it has been working on in the past few\nmonths. It’s important to note that some of what the team is currently working\non has been an ongoing process ever since Consensus 2019 in New York City.\n\nThe common denominator behind Particl’s presence at any of these events is the\ngoal to stimulate and kickstart the adoption of the Open Marketplace. With all\nthe groundbreaking benefits offered by the Open Marketplace, it is now time to\nget people to use it! ?\n\n> Note: Some of these conferences are happening at the same time. That’s because\nthe Particl team will be split into different groups in order to maximize its\npresence at these events. Then, the Particl team will all regroup in San\nFrancisco to operate its booth at SFBW’s Epicenter event on the 31st of October\nand the 1st of November.\nMoney20/20 — Vegas [https://us.money2020.com/] (October 27–30)\nThis year, Particl has been invited to Money20/20 [https://us.money2020.com/] by\na another team.

Money20/20 is a fintech and financial\nconference uniting some of the biggest names in these industries. While it isn’t\na cryptocurrency or blockchain conference at all, it is a perfect opportunity\nfor the project to be introduced to various key players in the eCommerce and\nfinancial industry as well as get to know businesses and help them reduce their\noperational costs through the Particl platform.\n\nThe team that’s inviting Particl to this conference wishes to introduce the\nParticl protocol to many of its partners, clients, and friends. The objective\nbehind these meetings is to help these businesses to reduce their costs and\nincrease their security and privacy by using the Particl protocol in multiple\nways.\n\n> Note: Money20/20 is part of Las Vegas’ Blockchain Week, meaning many\nafter-parties and side-events will be happening throughout the week. Particl\nwill seek out the most logical and worthy events to attend to depending on its\nneeds and obligations at the time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Money20/20 is where the Payments, FinTech and Financial Services ecosystem unite\nto create and explore the disruptive ways in which consumers and businesses\nmanage, spend and borrow money.

It’s also in the same city (Las\nVegas). The Particl team is going to seize this opportunity and have its team\nmembers that went to Money20/20 to continue their networking at WCC.\n\nSome of the companies and businesses present at Money20/20 are expected to also\nattend WCC, which will allow the team to continue some of the discussions\nstarted the day before and set follow-up meetings with different parties. It’ll\nbe a great opportunity to meet people that are also going to be at SFBW and get\nthem to pass by the Particl booth at SFBW’s Epicenter event and attend Dr. Kapil\nAmarasinghe’s (Josky/Kapoor) talk on Particl.\n\n> Note: WCC is part of Las Vegas’ Blockchain Week, meaning many after-parties and\nside-events will be happening throughout the week.

Fortunately, you shouldn’t worry too much about missing it if you\ncan’t make it to the conference as the full video of the talk will be published\nonline shortly after.\n\nNot only is the entire San Francisco Blockchain Week, with all of its events,\nside-events, and after-parties, the ideal opportunity to show Particl to all\nsorts of individuals (B2C and C2C users), but it’s also the perfect moment to\nget it in front of the right businesses that are hungry about leveraging new\ninnovations to optimize what they have to offer.\n\nFor more information, read this blog post published earlier this month on\nParticl’s blog: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a\n\nParticl in San Francisco - SFBW 2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a]\nParticl is excited to announce that 12 Particl representatives will be going to\nthe 2019 San Francisco Blockchain Week…\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a]\n\n> Note: Epicenter is part of the San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW), meaning\nmany after-parties and side-events will be happening throughout the week.\nParticl will seek out the most logical and worthy events to attend to depending\non its needs and obligations at the time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> San Francisco Blockchain Week [https://sfblockchainweek.io/partners] brings\ntogether blockchain startups, enterprise initiatives, academics, developers, and\ninvestors together in a single space.

Not only is this the intersection between the Asian and\nEuropean FinTech industries, but the country is also seeking to push new\nregulations that would eliminate any taxes for purchases and sales made using\ncryptocurrencies. This, combined with the Open Marketplace’s near-zero costs,\nwill create a huge opportunity for businesses, allowing them to dramatically\nreduce their costs in a way that simply wouldn’t be possible if using\ntraditional payment methods (as in…not using cryptocurrencies).\n\nOn top of that, Singaporeans and Singaporean businesses are known for being\nparticularly tech-savvy and at the forefront of innovations. The strong benefits\nof the Open Marketplace, combined with the new crypto-friendly tax regulations\nthat are being proposed within the country, make a very strong case for using\nParticl.\n\nFor this reason, the team is going to send Particl’s advisor Miguel Cuneta to\ntouch base with various Singapore-based businesses and demonstrate how they\ncould dramatically optimize their entire business models. While individuals\nstand to save a lot of money per sale selling on Particl, Miguel’s presence at\nthis conference will mostly be focused on reaching out to businesses.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> BlockShow Asia 2019 is one of the major international platforms for showcasing\ninnovative Blockchain solutions revealing hottest industry trends & sensations\nand bringing together Blockchain enthusiasts and experts from all over the world\n(powered by Cointelegraph).The conference will take place on November, 14–15 in\nSingapore, Marina Bay Sands Expo — the city that has earned the distinction as\none of the world’s top destinations for blockchain meetings.\n\nSlush Helsinki — Finland [https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/] (November\n21–22)\nSlush is a world-renowned startup focused conference.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
