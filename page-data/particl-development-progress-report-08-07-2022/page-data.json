This week has been a busy one with two Particl Desktop releases\nand the important detailed announcement of BasicSwap, Particl's upcoming\nprivate, free, and unrestricted DEX.\n\nSo let's not wait any longer and get down to the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nDesktop Client Updates ✅\nThis week, we've released two Particl Desktop updates (3.2.1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1] and 3.2.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]). Both of these\ndesktop client updates are intended to fix bugs and improve the overall user\nimprovements with a few tweaks to the desktop client and marketplace dApp. \n\nNotably, Particl Desktop 3.2.2 fixes a particular bug that caused, in some\ncircumstances, listings and orders to not show up on some user's clients due to\nthe market service not being able to receive SMSG messages from Particl Core\nwhen offline. This is now resolved.\n\nBecause both of these clients fix a lot of issues, we strongly recommend\nupdating your desktop client as soon as you can so that you can benefit from the\nmost up-to-date Particl experience.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 ?️\nAs the two previously-mentioned Particl Desktop client updates occupied most of\nthis week's time, the work related to Particl Desktop 3.3 mentioned in last\nweek's development progress report is still ongoing.\n\n> We're currently working on changing the way Particl Core interacts with Particl\nDesktop so that it doesn't necessarily automatically starts when the desktop\nclient is launched. That's part of the user configuration-related updates coming\nto Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nIndeed, you will have the option to launch Particl Core automatically, and that\nmay be the preferred way for the vast majority of people, but you will also be\nable to manually start it after the application launches. This will allow you to\nconfigure various startup options first, such as having core connect via Tor\nfrom the first launch. Or providing more controls for connecting to an already\nrunning core service. — Quote from last week's progress report\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-24-06-2022/]\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]We've been keeping up\nwith upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain Particl\nCore up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
