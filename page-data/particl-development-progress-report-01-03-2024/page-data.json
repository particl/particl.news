we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nWe announced that Particl Desktop development would resume shortly, and those\nplans are still on track for the 2 weeks approximation we gave last week. Today,\nwe're happy to share some of the deliverables we're exploring for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop releases.\n\n> Note: The items listed below are not set in stone. Some may be taken out and new\nitems may appear as we work on the upcoming releases.\nParticl Desktop 3.3.3\nThe most immediate desktop release will focus on minor fixes and items that were\nearmarked for it when development paused a few months ago.\n\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandonned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n * Investigate a potential problem with market identities and fix if issue is\n   found.\n * Investigate a potential issue with the editing functionality for Seller\n   Templates.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.4\nThe subsequent release will be almost exclusively focused on marketplace-related\nbug fixes and improvements. The goal with this update is to get the marketplace\nto a satisfactory level of stability and usability while we transition towards\nbuilding the new marketplace dApp.\n\n * Export Seller Templates to .csv file to easily migrate listings.\n * Allow for batch editing of listing details (i.e., shipping costs).\n * Improve publishing process of listings across different markets/identities.\n * Add an overriding functionality to the batch publish window.\n * Automate batch publishing (retries until all listings are successfully\n   published).\n * Add additional shipping options.\n * Allow Seller Templates to be sorted based on their attributes.\n * Increase character limit to listing description and titles.\n * Allow seller to delete or hide Seller Templates that aren't needed anymore.\n * Enable .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image files.\n\nParticl Desktop for TAILS OS\nAdditionally, we're exploring the requirements to make Particl Desktop\ncompatible with the hyper-private and amnesic TAILS Linux OS. While we have no\nspecific deliverables to announce regarding this, it seems likely that this will\nrequire a specific TAILS-focused version of Particl Desktop as it requires files\nto be managed differently so that it can work in conjunction with persistent\nmemory (i.e., storing required data like orders, Seller Templates, or the\nblockchain on a USB stick) more easily.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Here's a part of what we've worked\non this week:\n\n * Provide an alternative to secp256k1_clz64_var using HAVE_BUILTIN_CLZLL.\n * Add support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets.\n * Set the createoffers.py script's min_swap_amount variable to offer min bid\n   amount also (currently only used for bids).\n * Allow multiple signing keys to be tried with the basicswap-prepare script.\n * Set the state of expired bids to \"timed-out\".\n * \"Accept bid\" should be removed — like the \"abandon bid\" button — when not\n   it's not possible to accept (e.g., expired bid).\n\nUser Interface ?️\nThis week again, we've rolled out user interface updates to the dev branch which\nyou can now test.\n\nIf you would like to test these changes before they make it into the master \nbranch, you can change your active BasicSwap branch to the dev branch (using git\ncheckout dev) and updating BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nas you would typically do for a regular update.\n\nNotably, we've pushed changes to the way the order book is displayed that\nsimplify and make it more intuitive. More GUI updates coming next week!\n\nParticl x Litecoin MWEB Contest ?\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)Here’s your chance to win a 2013\nLealana 1 Litecoin physical coin worth nearly $1,000!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/]To celebrate the launch of\nLitecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX, we're giving away five (5) 2013 Lealana 1\nLitecoin physical coins, each one valued at nearly $1,000 USD, in a new contest\nthat starts today.\n\nFor complete details on how to participate, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/] to our contest blog post.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
