This blog\npost will let you know everything you need about the hardfork and about how to\nprepare ahead. Let’s jump in directly and look at the details more closely.\n\n> Note: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.18\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18] or greater if\nyou haven’t already done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will\nlead you to connect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other\npeople will not be relayed and you won't be earning staking rewards.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardfork Schedule\nIn the first place, Particl’s testnet will hardfork on the 1st of January 2022,\nat 17:00 UTC. This will provide the ability for everybody to ensure that\neverything goes as expected. \n\nThen, on the 1st of February 2022, at 17:00 UTC, Particl's mainnet network will\nhardfork.\n\nPrepare Ahead\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and ensure future functionality of\nyour Particl apps, you need to update your Particl Core node to the latest\nversion available [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]. \n\nOnce you've updated your node(s), you don't need to do anything; you'll\nautomatically fork to the right chain, along with the rest of the network, on\nthe 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC.\n\nThe update procedure differs depending on your environment.\n\nParticl Desktop\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, close it down completely and re-open it. The\nclient will update itself automatically. Look at the bottom left corner of your\nclient; the \"core\" version should display 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Partyman\nIf you are cold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, enter\nthis command to update your node.\n\ncd ~/partyman && ./partyman update\n\nVerify that the update went on as expected by executing this command.\n\n./partyman status\n\nThe displayed version should be version 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Core - QT Wallet\nWith a standalone Particl Core - QT wallet, you need to download and install the\nlatest version manually.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.18 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019218Hashes121365dec50e99eba4c25a2d7ff2a1e968949717bd0d8d6706c3f172fd596373\nparticl-0.19.2.18-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]Particl Copay\nIf you use the mobile Particl Copay wallet, then no user interaction is required\nfrom you. The core version will be updated automatically in time for the\nhardfork.\n\nPART Coins on Cold Staking Pools\nIf you stake coins on cold staking pools, then you don't need to do anything\nother than to ensure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with Particl\n0.19.2.18 or greater. \n\nHowever, you must be aware that if the pool you're staking on doesn't update\ntheir nodes in time for the hardfork, you'll be staking on the wrong chain and\nthus, won't be receiving rewards. For this reason, make sure the cold staking\npool you're staking on updates in time. You can usually do this by appending \n/version or /api/version at the end of the pool's URL (i.e., \nhttps://coldstakingpool.com/api/version). \n\nIf you are the operator of a pool, please follow these instructions\n[https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.md] to\nupdate your node.\n\nPART Coins on Exchanges\nWe have started reaching out to exchanges on which PART is available in\npreparation for this hardfork.\n\nAs is usual, no customer interaction is needed as exchanges manage their own\nnodes. However, make sure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with the latest\nversion of Particl Core.\n\nWhat’s New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings more privacy and smaller transaction fees to Particl\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], \nBasicSwap [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) and for a\nwide variety of transaction types.\n\nparticl-core/fork-notes.md at master · particl/particl-coreParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/master/doc/fork-notes.md#rct-bug-fix-fork-3]\nTaproot\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction.\n\nFixing listing fee adjustment feature\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower. \n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability has been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, once the fee target amount drops below\na certain point, the code won't allow it to change anymore (up or down). This\nhardfork fixes that issue by clamping the minimum amount it can change to 1 sat,\nmaking the feature functional and allowing stakers to adjust listing fees again.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThis hardfork will also re-enable a small number of disabled outputs from people\nwho’ve missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and\nhaven’t put up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the\nsteps mentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\nFailure to submit your claim before the hardfork will mean you’ll have to wait\nfor the next one. If you don’t have any disabled outputs, or simply don’t know\nwhat this is about, then you don’t need to do anything here.\n\n> Note: The deadline to submit your claim for this hardfork is on the 1st of\nJanuary 2022, at 17:00 UTC.\nReducing money supply when outputs are burned (for future use)\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis hardfork is an important one for the ecosystem, notably with the major\naddition of Taproot and the fix to the listing fee adjustment mechanism. \n\nWe recommend that you update your node(s) as soon as possible; failure to do so\nin time for the hardfork will result in you being on the wrong chain.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

So see you all on Monday! Oh, right, it's time for our\nweekly development update first! ?\n\nThis week, most of the focus has been on adding a few key improvements to the\nmarketplace and desktop client after receiving various feedback from the\ncommunity. While these fixes may seem mundane to some, they fix relatively\nencumbering issues that affect both buyers and sellers in different cases. A few\nexamples of these improvements will be given in the Particl Desktop progress\nreport section of this blog post.\n\nAdditionally, we mentioned last week that, due to the larger-than-expected scope\nof adding digital items delivery, we were evaluating whether we'd include that\nfeature in Particl Desktop 3.1 or not. After looking at the situation, we've\nopted not to include it. \n\nA big reason for this decision is that Particl Desktop 3.1 now includes a lot of\nimportant and quality-of-life fixes and improvements over the initial mainnet\nrelease of Particl V3. Delaying their release would be counter-productive and\nunnecessary. Indeed, some of these fixes are relatively critical for some users,\nand so we're prioritizing releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 faster so that these\nusers can benefit from the fixes and gain back a better user experience.\n\nWith that in mind, we've started planning ahead for the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 on testnet. We're finalizing the last few remaining items planned\nfor 3.1 and will then build a testnet client for community testing. We'll\ncommunicate more details on the testnet release in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nIn the intro of this progress report, we've mentioned that several improvements\nhave been added to Particl Desktop, notably relating to Particl Marketplace.\n\nFor example, we've added a shortcut in the Send/Convert page to split a\ntransaction into multiple outputs, which should make it more visible as well as\neasier to set on a transaction-per-transaction basis. This has been a\nmuch-requested improvement by some of our vendors as it previously caused them\nsome issues, especially concerning the process of publishing listings.\n\nAlso, if something goes wrong during a transaction and one party does not\nreceive an updated order status from the other party (which means their client\ndidn't properly pick up the intended SMSG message), that other party can now\nsimply press a button that's been added to the order flow which conveniently\nallows for their last action status to be rebroadcast. It was possible to do\njust that in the past, but it required commands to be entered manually in the\nconsole window; a less-than-ideal user experience. This isn't needed anymore and\ncan be accomplished with the simple click of a button.\n\nSimilar to the item above, another button has been added. This one rescans SMSG\nmessages (executes the smsgscanbuckets command) for you, so in the case where it\nmight appear that an SMSG message was unproperly received, you can just click on\nthat button so that your client tries to find and process the message.\n\nAnother small change that was added is the display of a count of new listings\nthat are not yet displayed in the market browser. Previously, an alert indicator\nwould be displayed over the refresh button; this is still there but now a count\nof how many new items have been received is also displayed near the refresh\nbutton.\n\nAside from these, a variety of bug fixes and general improvements have been\nadded, as is usual, making this week one that ended up being quite productive\nand helpful in improving the general user experience.\n\nWith all of that being said, here's the list of remaining items to be included\nin Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress and is expected to be\n   wrapped up next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above item is completed. It is expected to resume next\n   week or so and is also expected to be wrapped up relatively quickly.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). While this task has seen some progress since it was started, it will\n   not be included in Particl Desktop 3.1 and is pushed for later on. \n\nKeeping the listed items above in mind, we will be starting the process of\nbuilding and releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet very soon. \n\nAs always, we'd rather not give a precise date or estimate for its release, but\nwe hope to begin the process towards the end of next week. We'll give you more\naccurate details on this in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl's Core Developer, Tecnovert, has focused mostly on Particl\nCore and on preparing the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIndeed, Particl Core 0.21.2.5 has been pre-released a couple of days ago and you\ncan now download and install it by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.5]. For a complete\nlist of changes, visit this page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02125]\n. \n\nRelease Particl Core 0.21.2.5 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02125Hashes2f8c3d3ab49dbf03dbc2fb4a9989a07b53e81ac89a91bf94fe5af8ab763f9887\nparticl-0.21.2.5-aarch64...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.5]Notable in the\nchangelog for Particl Core 0.21.2.5 is the fact that the upcoming hardfork has\nnow been scheduled. Indeed, on the 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC, the\nParticl blockchain will hardfork and include a variety of new features,\nincluding Taproot activation.\n\nWe'll make a formal announcement on the hardfork next week and will include in\nit all the necessary details about it. We'll also publish in that blog post a\ncomplete list of the new features and changes it will introduce.\n\nPlease note that, if you still have disabled outputs as a result of the\nemergency hardfork that happened earlier this year, you will need to submit your\nclaim to have them re-activated before the hardfork. Failure to do so means\nyou'll need to wait for the next, subsequent hardfork to have your outputs\nre-activated. To learn more about how to submit your claim, please refer to\nthis\nblog post [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\n\nAside from that, there have been some minor improvements made to BasicSwap's\nunderlying protocol, notably around its UI and the use of RingCT/CT swaps. We\nare still working towards launching the Open Beta soon and will give more\ndetailed information on this as soon as we can.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe'd like to thank you, as always, for your passion, dedication, and various\ncontributions to the Particl project. Your feedback is always incredibly useful\nand helps make the platform better and easier to use for all. \n\nWe wish you a wonderful weekend and we'll see you back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

So see you all on Monday! Oh, right, it's time for our weekly development update first! ?</p><p>This week, most of the focus has been on adding a few key improvements to the marketplace and desktop client after receiving various feedback from the community. While these fixes may seem mundane to some, they fix relatively encumbering issues that affect both buyers and sellers in different cases. A few examples of these improvements will be given in the Particl Desktop progress report section of this blog post.</p><p>Additionally, we mentioned last week that, due to the larger-than-expected scope of adding digital items delivery, we were evaluating whether we'd include that feature in Particl Desktop 3.1 or not. After looking at the situation, we've opted not to include it. </p><p>A big reason for this decision is that Particl Desktop 3.1 now includes a lot of important and quality-of-life fixes and improvements over the initial mainnet release of Particl V3. Delaying their release would be counter-productive and unnecessary. Indeed, some of these fixes are relatively critical for some users, and so we're prioritizing releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 faster so that these users can benefit from the fixes and gain back a better user experience.</p><p>With that in mind, we've started planning ahead for the release of Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet. We're finalizing the last few remaining items planned for 3.1 and will then build a testnet client for community testing. We'll communicate more details on the testnet release in next week's progress report.</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-development-progress\">Particl Desktop Development Progress</h2><p>In the intro of this progress report, we've mentioned that several improvements have been added to Particl Desktop, notably relating to Particl Marketplace.</p><p>For example, we've added a shortcut in the Send/Convert page to split a transaction into multiple outputs, which should make it more visible as well as easier to set on a transaction-per-transaction basis. This has been a much-requested improvement by some of our vendors as it previously caused them some issues, especially concerning the process of publishing listings.</p><p>Also, if something goes wrong during a transaction and one party does not receive an updated order status from the other party (which means their client didn't properly pick up the intended SMSG message), that other party can now simply press a button that's been added to the order flow which conveniently allows for their last action status to be rebroadcast. It was possible to do just that in the past, but it required commands to be entered manually in the console window; a less-than-ideal user experience. This isn't needed anymore and can be accomplished with the simple click of a button.</p><p>Similar to the item above, another button has been added. This one rescans SMSG messages (executes the <code class=\"language-text\">smsgscanbuckets</code> command) for you, so in the case where it might appear that an SMSG message was unproperly received, you can just click on that button so that your client tries to find and process the message.  </p><p>Another small change that was added is the display of a count of new listings that are not yet displayed in the market browser. Previously, an alert indicator would be displayed over the refresh button; this is still there but now a count of how many new items have been received is also displayed near the refresh button.</p><p>Aside from these, a variety of bug fixes and general improvements have been added, as is usual, making this week one that ended up being quite productive and helpful in improving the general user experience.</p><p>With all of that being said, here's the list of remaining items to be included in Particl Desktop 3.1.</p><ul><li>Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once<strong> is now</strong> <strong>complete, </strong>but has received various bug fixes and improvements this week.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
