Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nCommunity Questions\nLast week’s livestream had to be delayed for a week, so the community had quite\na few questions for Paul. Note that some of these answers have been updated with\nthe most recent news and developments that happened since the livestream.\n\nWhen can a new Particl Desktop be expected?\n\nCold staking widget is back!A new update (1.2.2) for Particl Desktop is almost\nready and should be released any day from now. Currently at the pre-release\nstage, it is going to be a big release with several bug fixes (i.e. cold staking\nwidget), stability improvements as well as a lot of new additions. Most\nimportantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and\nuser-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our\nmainnet Particl Marketplace.\n\nWe strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are\nabsolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to\ncreating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics\nalso go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building\nan online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.\n\nFor a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social\nmedia coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME]\n\nIs there any update about exchanges listing?\n\nWe are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to\nget the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very\nimportant, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl\nMarketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother\nand more seamless the experience will be.\n\nWe’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due\nto our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges,\nrather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive\nwith securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to\nexchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence\nand working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange\nfrom adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.\n\nWhat would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?\n\nDarpal Rating’s June Github Audit ReportWhile a more valuable PART coin allows\nus to do more, the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the\nPART coin. In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year,\nand may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.\n\nThe Particl Foundation website [https://particl.foundation] is the best resource\nfor most questions surrounding financials.\n\nNo matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work\nwe put into developing the Particl project.\n\nIndeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest\nvalue, Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/@DPRating], a rating agency conducting\na monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, \nranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and\nprivacy coins\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the\ndevelopment process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.\n\nThese consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120] only confirms the\nrelentlessness of the development force behind Particl.\n\nWe are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This\nfunding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take\nParticl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and\ninvest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of\nParticl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups\nusually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then\nraising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.\n\nThe primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it\nwill signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one\nwhere marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will\nbe more prevalent than they currently are.\n\nAny update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?\n\nThere is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger\nintegration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger\nso that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We\nencourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to\nintegrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing\norganic community support.\n\nNote that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is\nrecommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with\npublic transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.\n\nThere is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware\nintegration: Trezor.\n\nIs the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?\n\nWe are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not\nproduction-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time.\nWhat we’re looking into, however, is the new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj\n[https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1] that would\nallow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing\nfeasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to\ngenerate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic\nrouting protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.\n\nIs it looking at Bulletproofs?\nAs for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are\nsomething we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the\nproper research & development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain\nhasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan,\nhowever, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of\nBulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy\ntransactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of\npriorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that\nprotocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.\n\nFor more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper\nhere: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n\nAny plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?\n\nYes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything\nelse, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the\nmarketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and\nhardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop\nversion).\n\nWe also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The\nentire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the\ncommunity. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also\npossible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be\nadded to it.\n\nWill there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in\nParticl Desktop such as the marketplace?\n\nYes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is\ndone with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially\nthose in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones\ninstead. For these reasons, we strongly believe we absolutely need a mobile\nversion for the marketplace and will put the resources in place for this further\ndown the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on\nthe multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a secure \ndecentralized web interface and mobile application possible.\n\nAs we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set\nup a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this\nmobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary\nround where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest\nassured, we know we need this and will make it happen!\n\nSuch a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when\nwe said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.\n\nWhen will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?\n\nParticl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis\nblock but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the\nmessaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to\ncommunicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The\nteam is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently\nnot in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.\n\nWill there be a marketing push for RingCT?\n\nYes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based\nhardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release\nsimilarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy\nprotocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other\ncodebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be\nproperly advertised as such.\n\nWhat’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?\n\nIntegrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re\ncurrently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a\nhardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation\nfor it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance\nsystem also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource\nefficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the\nlikely strategy the team will pursue.\n\nWith that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation\nmay be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can\nbe included at the same time as the governance system.\n\nDo you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?\n\nWeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting,\nauditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code\naudit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl\nfor the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10\ncustom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that\nno major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only\nsome minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to\nreceive the fully detailed report.\n\nGraphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in\nthe Particl protocolAre Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?\n\nYes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing\nour private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress\nwhich will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system\nis going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that\nultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first\npost-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet\nexclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes\nonly.\n\nWhen will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?\n\nThe report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website. Keep an eye\nout here: http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates & Tidbits\nPaul also had a few comments and information for the community not covered by\nthe questions asked by the community.\n\nGithub\nOne of the best ways to keep updated with the development side of the Particl\nproject is to go to the source. In fact, our Github page contains a lot of\ninformation and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting\nway to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of\nour repositories.\n\nFor example, the Particl Desktop pull request tab\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls] shows a few interesting pull\nrequests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find\ninformation about multi-wallets\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], project governance\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] (community proposals), \nand more\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed].\n\nNew Status Report Published\nFor those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with\nthe Particl development news, the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/] on our website (particl.io) is the perfect\npoint of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about\nwhat is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well\nas what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!\n\nStatus ReportProject Governance (Community Proposals)\nAs you can see in both the GIF above and in the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/], we’re currently actively working on putting\ntogether the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their\nown proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not\nrepresent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they\nwere voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand,\nare proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of\nproposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be\nadopted and acted upon.\n\nFor more screenshots of the project governance user interface, click here\n[https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q], and for more information about the development of\nthis Particl Desktop feature, click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087].\n\nCommunity Fund\nIn light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there\nhas never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our\nKialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of\naround 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community,\nnot the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held\non the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the\ncommunity to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on\nParticl Desktop by creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME].\n\nFirst Anniversary\nWe celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary! In fact, Particl’s\ngenesis block was staked on the 17th of Jul 17, 2017, at 9:00:00 AM\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c]\n, and we took the opportunity to thank our supporters and recap on the progress\nmade in just a short year\n[https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95]. The best is yet\nto come!\n\nNJIT’s Academic Paper\nWe currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and\nwork on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them\nthe green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within\nacademic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime\nbefore we make it public on ours.\n\nParticl in Johannesburg\nMembers of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in\nJohannesburg, South Africa. The conference is a one-day event with a focus on\nBlockchain Technology and is in part sponsored by the Particl Foundation. Stop\nby the Particl booth to talk with team members and get Particl swag!\n\nFor more information about the schedule and to get tickets, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-on-location-at-johannesburg-blockchain-conference-july-27th-2018-7e19fa083b08\n\nDiscord\nWe will gradually be moving to Discord officially, which means it will become\nthe preferred or “default” chat platform for most of the team and chat support.\nWe will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord\ncan still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms\nwill not be focused on as much as before.\n\nWe believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its\nflexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse\nforum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience\nwith bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.\n\nMusic Channel\nOne cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music\nchannel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music\nthat anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on\nDiscord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite\nmusic with other Particl community members!\n\nParticl on Discourse\nWe are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it\nup. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it\nshould probably be resolved for next week.\n\nDemonstration of the coming Particl forumLaunching the forum will change a few\nthings around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the\nPartaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found\na few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate\nwithdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform\nwhich we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking\ninto potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We\nwill keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding\neverything forum related.\n\nOne other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be\nfor vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference\nto get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a\nproduct (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We\nstrongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow\nand the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone\nto dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.\n\nNew Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace\nWe will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl\nMarketplace. One of these goodies we want to make available are the pins\ngenerously offered to us by ICOsensei. Keep an eye out for any announcement\nregarding marketplace giveaways!\n\n—\n\nCryptoRamble Videos Since Last Community Update\n * Beginner’s Guide to Cryptocurrency 2018\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHmzVvloFFo]\n * Particl Development Update [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6IHDNw0BTQ]\n * Immigrant Data is Being Sold to ICE (WUWP#3)\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRJINSRmHSE]","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-aEYJjiffXVsGW_UnHl0LlA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Did you miss our last AMA/FAQ livestream on Youtube?

Note that some of these answers have been updated with the most recent news and developments that happened since the livestream.</p><p><strong>When can a new Particl Desktop be expected?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-HvxF1evJHXiJqO-NkfSxwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Cold staking widget is back!</figcaption></figure><p>A new update (1.2.2) for Particl Desktop is almost ready and should be released any day from now. Currently at the pre-release stage, it is going to be a big release with several bug fixes (i.e. cold staking widget), stability improvements as well as a lot of new additions. Most importantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and user-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace.</p><p>We strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are absolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to creating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics also go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building an online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">For a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social media coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.</a></p><p><strong>Is there any update about exchanges listing?</strong></p><p>We are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to get the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very important, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother and more seamless the experience will be.</p><p>We’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due to our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges, rather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive with securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to exchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence and working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange from adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.</p><p><strong>What would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-DMZNvDVsJwSGgpj57S2nqg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Darpal Rating’s June Github Audit Report</figcaption></figure><p>While a more valuable PART coin allows us to do more, <strong>the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the PART coin.</strong> In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year, and may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.</p><p>The Particl Foundation <a href=\"https://particl.foundation\">website</a> is the best resource for most questions surrounding financials.</p><p><strong>No matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work we put into developing the Particl project.</strong></p><p>Indeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest value, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\">Darpal Rating</a>, a rating agency conducting a monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, <a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\">ranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and privacy coins</a>. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the development process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.</p><p>These <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120\">consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating</a> only confirms the relentlessness of the development force behind Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>We are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This funding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take Particl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and invest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of Particl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups usually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then raising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.</p><p>The primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it will signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one where marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will be more prevalent than they currently are.</p><p><strong>Any update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?</strong></p><p>There is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger integration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger so that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We encourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to integrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing organic community support.</p><p>Note that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is recommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with public transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.</p><p>There is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware integration: Trezor.</p><p><strong>Is the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?</strong></p><p>We are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not production-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time. What we’re looking into, however, is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1\">new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj</a> that would allow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing feasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to generate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic routing protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.</p><h3 id=\"is-it-looking-at-bulletproofs\">Is it looking at Bulletproofs?</h3><p>As for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are something we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the proper research &amp; development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain hasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan, however, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of Bulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy transactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of priorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that protocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.</p><p>For more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper here: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Any plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything else, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the marketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and hardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop version).</p><p>We also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The entire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the community. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also possible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be added to it.</p><p><strong>Will there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in Particl Desktop such as the marketplace?</strong></p><p>Yes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is done with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially those in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones instead. For these reasons, we strongly believe <strong>we absolutely need a mobile version for the marketplace</strong> and will put the resources in place for this further down the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on the multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a <strong>secure </strong>decentralized web interface and mobile application possible.</p><p>As we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set up a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this mobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary round where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest assured, we know we need this and will make it happen!</p><p>Such a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when we said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.</p><p><strong>When will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?</strong></p><p>Particl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis block but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the messaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The team is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently not in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.</p><p><strong>Will there be a marketing push for RingCT?</strong></p><p>Yes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based hardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release similarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy protocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be properly advertised as such.</p><p><strong>What’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?</strong></p><p>Integrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re currently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a hardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation for it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance system also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource efficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the likely strategy the team will pursue.</p><p>With that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation may be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can be included at the same time as the governance system.</p><p><strong>Do you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?</strong></p><p>WeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting, auditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code audit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl for the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10 custom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that no major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only some minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to receive the fully detailed report.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NIKYtvnIcCCfLi2otcVl2w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Graphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in the Particl protocol</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Are Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?</strong></p><p>Yes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing our private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress which will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system is going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that ultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first post-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet exclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes only.</p><p><strong>When will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?</strong></p><p>The report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website.

Community submitted proposals do not represent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they were voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand, are proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of proposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be adopted and acted upon.</p><p>For more screenshots of the project governance user interface, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q\">click here</a>, and for more information about the development of this Particl Desktop feature, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">click here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h3><p>In light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there has never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our Kialo thread!

Due to our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges, rather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive with securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to exchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence and working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange from adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.</p><p><strong>What would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-DMZNvDVsJwSGgpj57S2nqg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Darpal Rating’s June Github Audit Report</figcaption></figure><p>While a more valuable PART coin allows us to do more, <strong>the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the PART coin.</strong> In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year, and may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.</p><p>The Particl Foundation <a href=\"https://particl.foundation\">website</a> is the best resource for most questions surrounding financials.</p><p><strong>No matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work we put into developing the Particl project.</strong></p><p>Indeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest value, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\">Darpal Rating</a>, a rating agency conducting a monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, <a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\">ranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and privacy coins</a>.

This funding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take Particl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and invest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of Particl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups usually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then raising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.</p><p>The primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it will signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one where marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will be more prevalent than they currently are.</p><p><strong>Any update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?</strong></p><p>There is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger integration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger so that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We encourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to integrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing organic community support.</p><p>Note that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is recommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with public transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.</p><p>There is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware integration: Trezor.</p><p><strong>Is the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?</strong></p><p>We are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not production-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time. What we’re looking into, however, is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1\">new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj</a> that would allow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing feasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to generate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic routing protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.</p><h3 id=\"is-it-looking-at-bulletproofs\">Is it looking at Bulletproofs?</h3><p>As for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are something we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the proper research &#x26; development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain hasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan, however, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of Bulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy transactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of priorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that protocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.</p><p>For more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper here: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Any plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything else, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the marketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and hardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop version).</p><p>We also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The entire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the community. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also possible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be added to it.</p><p><strong>Will there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in Particl Desktop such as the marketplace?</strong></p><p>Yes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is done with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially those in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones instead. For these reasons, we strongly believe <strong>we absolutely need a mobile version for the marketplace</strong> and will put the resources in place for this further down the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on the multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a <strong>secure </strong>decentralized web interface and mobile application possible.</p><p>As we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set up a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this mobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary round where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest assured, we know we need this and will make it happen!</p><p>Such a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when we said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.</p><p><strong>When will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?</strong></p><p>Particl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis block but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the messaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The team is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently not in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.</p><p><strong>Will there be a marketing push for RingCT?</strong></p><p>Yes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based hardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release similarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy protocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be properly advertised as such.</p><p><strong>What’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?</strong></p><p>Integrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re currently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a hardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation for it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance system also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource efficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the likely strategy the team will pursue.</p><p>With that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation may be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can be included at the same time as the governance system.</p><p><strong>Do you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?</strong></p><p>WeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting, auditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code audit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl for the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10 custom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that no major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only some minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to receive the fully detailed report.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NIKYtvnIcCCfLi2otcVl2w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Graphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in the Particl protocol</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Are Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?</strong></p><p>Yes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing our private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress which will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system is going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that ultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first post-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet exclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes only.</p><p><strong>When will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?</strong></p><p>The report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website.

In fact, our Github page contains a lot of information and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting way to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of our repositories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NMRZXp9c4-okdV3gNRN3dw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls\">Particl Desktop pull request tab</a> shows a few interesting pull requests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find information about <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096\">multi-wallets</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">project governance</a> (community proposals), <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">and more</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published\">New Status Report Published</h3><p>For those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with the Particl development news, the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a> on our website (particl.io) is the perfect point of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about what is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well as what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NFoIFPJqgKElhAPMWReMiA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Status Report</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"project-governance-community-proposals-\">Project Governance (Community Proposals)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-3UqZHLKP-rRwh8VI8lvCeg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As you can see in both the GIF above and in the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a>, we’re currently actively working on putting together the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their own proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not represent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they were voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand, are proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of proposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be adopted and acted upon.</p><p>For more screenshots of the project governance user interface, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q\">click here</a>, and for more information about the development of this Particl Desktop feature, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">click here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h3><p>In light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there has never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our Kialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of around 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community, not the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held on the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the community to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on Particl Desktop by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread</a>.</p><h3 id=\"first-anniversary\">First Anniversary</h3><p>We celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary!

The best is yet to come!</p><h3 id=\"njit-s-academic-paper\">NJIT’s Academic Paper</h3><p>We currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and work on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them the green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within academic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime before we make it public on ours.</p><h3 id=\"particl-in-johannesburg\">Particl in Johannesburg</h3><p>Members of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in Johannesburg, South Africa.

We will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord can still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms will not be focused on as much as before.</p><p>We believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its flexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse forum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience with bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.</p><h3 id=\"music-channel\">Music Channel</h3><p>One cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music channel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music that anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to.

We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it should probably be resolved for next week.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-cBKLFANfZQHq8Ij8yMgDTg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Demonstration of the coming Particl forum</figcaption></figure><p>Launching the forum will change a few things around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the Partaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found a few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate withdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform which we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking into potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We will keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding everything forum related.</p><p>One other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be for vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference to get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a product (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We strongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow and the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone to dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.</p><h3 id=\"new-merch-available-for-free-on-particl-marketplace\">New Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace</h3><p>We will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl Marketplace.

17th\n[https://particl.news/particl-launch-update-july-17th-2017-15ec6d4fd6a8], 2017,\none year ago today, Particl main network (mainnet) genesis block was generated\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c]\n, becoming one of the only pure Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies not\nstarting with an initial mining period —truly a rare breed.\n\nWe created a nice round-up of what Particl accomplished in 2017 within our\nend-of-year review\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797] January 1st.\nNow, seven months later and 365 days since our first block on the Particl\nblockchain, we celebrate how far we’ve come in such a short time.\n\n> Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic. — Arthur C. Clarke\nDoesn’t that ring true in this — still very young — space made irresistibly\nfascinating by S. Nakamoto and their “magic internet money”?\n\n| btw, Particl mentioned in there ;)That naivety to understanding technology is\na double-edged sword in the decentralized ecosystem because fancy marketing and\n30 minutes spent writing an ERC20 contract can generate a lot of buzz (and\nmoney) around magical solutions to everyday problems.\n\nThe question becomes, when does the tech make sense and when doesn’t it?\n\nEnable Privacy\nSetting out to create a platform for privacy-focused decentralized applications\nis not a challenge for the faint of heart. In fact, among the thousands of\ncryptocurrency projects in existence, Particl is still one of the only\nopen-source platform being developed with privacy in its DNA.\n\nPrivacy is a well-discussed topic in blockchain solutions but 99% of the time it\nis merely an afterthought or even by product when building on a decentralized\nnetwork. Particl is private by design which makes everything our team develops\nmultiple times harder to achieve and is why no other project is comparable when\nlooking at the full breadth of products and features Particl already offers\nafter 1 year.\n\nWhenever shareholders are involved and need to be kept happy, privacy becomes a\nmarketing buzz word that is attached to data collection tools in fancy ways like \n“Personal Recommendations”, “Shoppers Also Liked”, “Your friends are talking\nabout…”, “You parked here…”.\n\nUser data is a powerful metric all companies use to their advantage in order to\nmaximize profits. A good marketing team will package it within a “privacy”\nwrapper to make users feel safe and cozy like warm alpaca socks, while the\npersonal information people willingly provide helps giant internet companies\nbuild better tools to appease shareholders and make the most money possible.\n\nThere is a case for privacy-focused decentralized applications in the tech\nindustry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nand, at one year young, Particl is one of the only project building an\nopen-source privacy platform that is truly private by design.\n\nOrigination & Innovation\nParticl Core [https://github.com/particl/particl-core] is the backbone of the\nproject and is the source for a number of privacy enhancements to the underlying\nBitcoin codebase this past year. All revolve around privacy and security and are\nindustry pioneering innovations:\n\n * Confidential Transactions (CT)\n * Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)\n * Particl Proof of Stake (PPoS) with Cold Staking\n * Secure Message (SMSG)\n\nParticl Core has averaged a new release every 3 weeks (20 releases) this year. A\nvery impressive development pace, wouldn’t you agree?

One item that\nis personally exciting to me is the Particl Open Market Protocol (OMP) that \nKewde [https://github.com/kewde] is working on. A library\n[https://github.com/particl/omp-lib] for the OMP has begun on Github that is\ntied to the Software Development Kit (SDK)\n\nParticl Network\nParticl is a testing environment by nature and all of our development is open\nsource and runs through multiple levels of testing and refinement.

Every piece of our\nprivacy platform is out in the open.\n\nParticl has maintained 2 active and functioning blockchains since our mainnet\ngenesis block was generated; which all our products and applications run on in\nvarious level of development and deployment. Our Mainnet chain is what most\npeople use to send and receive PART. Our Testnet chain is our research and\ndevelopment environment where new privacy features and security technology is\ncreated.\n\nMainnet\nThe first and only live version of Confidential Transactions (CT) on a Bitcoin\nbased blockchain has been on Particl’s mainnet since launch day 1 last year. We\nalso have the first and only cold storage staking protocol\n[https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac] on the main\nchain — no matter what others may say\n[https://www.coindesk.com/a-3-3-billion-claim-has-cardanos-blockchain-solved-proof-of-stake/] \n?.\n\nParticl was one of the first projects to have Native Segwit as well, meaning,\nevery transaction on Particl is a fast, low-cost, Segwit transaction.\n\nSecure Messages can be sent using our cli/Qt Core wallet builds\n[http://particl.io/downloads/].

This is a really big deal, even bigger than Particl also having the\nonly version of CT live on mainnet. RingCT is a very intense and complex privacy\nenhancement the Particl team implemented on our codebase and, as such, we went\nto great lengths to properly review and audit our design. Read more about the\nstatus of those reports further down the article.\n\nParticl Marketplace (ALPHA)\nOf course the biggest news for Particl this year has been the release of our MVP\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, Particl Marketplace. Our Alpha version of the marketplace is live on our\ntestnet.

Per our last Community Update, we have a 6 month grant\nestablished with NJIT for a RingCT peer review that just completed. We also\nhired WSA to perform a RingCT code audit that is only about 2 weeks of work.\n\nNJIT Peer Review\nOur team has a copy of Professor Qiang’s paper on Particl’s Ring Confidential\nTransactions and are reviewing it in-house and with his research team.\nUltimately Prof. Qiang has asked if they can submit the paper as an academic\nresearch paper for review among trade publications and peers. The team would\nfully support a submission after proper dialog between both teams is completed.\n\nWSA Code Audit\nA couple weeks ago we engaged WSA for a RingCT code audit. Ryno\n[https://github.com/rynomster] got word that the review is done and only 4 minor\nissues were found, nothing major or critical! The WSA team hinted that the\nreport would be delivered this week so we’ll keep everyone in the loop.\n\nClosing Remarks\n> The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the\nart. — John Lasseter\nThis quote rings true for every Pixar or Disney movie ever made.

He mentioned in that episode we would be looking at our scrum/sprint platform plan to see if we can open the scheduling and progress wireframes up to public viewing in an effort to be more transparent. That will be something to keep an eye out for for those who want to get more details on Particl R&#x26;D.</p><p>All our roadmap items are highly anticipatory because they directly tie to future products on Particl’s first-of-its-kind privacy platform. One item that is personally exciting to me is the <strong>Particl Open Market Protocol (OMP)</strong> that <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde\">Kewde</a> is working on. A <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/omp-lib\">library</a> for the OMP has begun on Github that is tied to the <strong>Software Development Kit (SDK)</strong></p><h2 id=\"particl-network\">Particl Network</h2><p>Particl is a testing environment by nature and all of our development is open source and runs through multiple levels of testing and refinement. We don’t close source our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop\">Desktop</a> GUI or our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">Market</a> backend. Every piece of our privacy platform is out in the open.</p><p>Particl has maintained 2 active and functioning blockchains since our mainnet genesis block was generated; which all our products and applications run on in various level of development and deployment. Our Mainnet chain is what most people use to send and receive PART. Our Testnet chain is our research and development environment where new privacy features and security technology is created.</p><h3 id=\"mainnet\">Mainnet</h3><p>The first and only live version of <strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong> on a Bitcoin based blockchain has been on Particl’s mainnet since launch day 1 last year. We also have the first and only <a href=\"https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac\">cold storage staking protocol</a> on the main chain — no matter what others may <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/a-3-3-billion-claim-has-cardanos-blockchain-solved-proof-of-stake/\">say</a> ?.</p><p>Particl was one of the first projects to have Native Segwit as well, meaning, every transaction on Particl is a fast, low-cost, Segwit transaction.</p><p>Secure Messages can be sent using our cli/Qt Core wallet <a href=\"http://particl.io/downloads/\">builds</a>. <strong>Particl Copay</strong> and <strong>Particl Desktop</strong> are 2 more official mobile and desktop clients (respectively) running on mainnet.</p><blockquote>We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works. — Douglas Adams</blockquote><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h3><p>I find this quote fitting for our flagship client, Particl Desktop. Mainstream adoption for cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications isn’t going to come down to how much is “under the hood”. Ultimately, widespread adoption will come down to how easy this or that is to use. There is no denying the level of care the <a href=\"https://github.com/gerlofvanek\">CRZ</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/xludx\">xludx</a> lead teams have placed on usability, design and simplicity within the entire line of Particl products/apps.</p><p>Most crypto project teams can create pretty pictures of what they plan to make and what they want to deliver, but very, very few can actually show you a well designed working app or even prototype until they’ve cycled through 12 to 24 months of funding.</p><p><strong>Desktop is one example of what Particl developers roadmap to build</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Genesis-Anniversary/0-0NNCK9M8KjA7CLmo.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><strong>Here is what the Particl team delivered</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Genesis-Anniversary/1-WMbgixnNqgWXAQFeuhyiaw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"testnet\">Testnet</h3><p>Particl testnet currently has the only working version of <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> on a Bitcoin based codebase in existence. <strong>This is a really big deal</strong>, even bigger than Particl also having the only version of CT live on mainnet. RingCT is a very intense and complex privacy enhancement the Particl team implemented on our codebase and, as such, we went to great lengths to properly review and audit our design. Read more about the status of those reports further down the article.</p><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace-alpha-\">Particl Marketplace (ALPHA)</h3><p>Of course the biggest news for Particl this year has been the release of our <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509\">MVP</a>, <strong>Particl Marketplace. </strong>Our Alpha version of the marketplace is live on our testnet. We have an active community of testers debugging it and our team is occasionally placing real Particl swag on the decentralized marketplace for users to get a real experience of the early buying process the private marketplace will offer; including our 2-party trustless escrow (MAD) protocol.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Alpha is a privacy-focused decentralized shopping app within Particl Desktop.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
