as a Strategic Advisor and MentorWe have some exciting news to share with you\nas we push forward into 2018 — something that has been in the works for a while.\n\nParticl is proud to add Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem to our stellar advisory\nteam as a Strategic Advisor and Mentor!\n> “We are excited to get some input from an industry heavyweight. Charlie’s\ninfluence and experience will help us grow tremendously.” Ryno Mathee,\nParticl Founder\nCharlie’s penchant for projects that aim to give freedom back to users by\nsolving a problem that exists in services people use everyday aligns nicely\nwithin Particl’s vision: to foster a fully independent, decentralized economy\nand provide a sustainable environment of collaboration and innovation that\nempowers peers across different blockchain projects while respecting their\nrights to freedom and privacy.\n\nFinding a Greater Purpose\nParticl has never been just another coin in the privacy bucket — only in\nexistence to entertain speculators while transactions traveling on the chain are\nmerely from one exchange to another. Particl was never envisioned as an\ninclusive ecosystem either, where only PART existed and all other\ncryptocurrencies were closed off to the Particl chain and apps.\n\nWe’ve built our foundation, we’ve developed our privacy coin, we’re going to\ndeliver our Particl Marketplace early in 2018. These are the first steps to\nbuilding a decentralized economy. A place PART can be spent and earned and a\nmarketplace most major cryptocurrencies will be accepted, both in use and in\ncommunity. ?\n\n> “I’m excited to be working with Particl,” says Charlie Shrem. “As I see privacy,\nfungibility and ease of use the main pillars for any crypto. What if there were\nno needles in the haystack?” — Charlie Shrem\nAdoption, Growth and Ease of Use\nAn early Bitcoin entrepreneur with a history of launching and growing successful\ncompanies inside and outside the cryptocurrency space, Charlie Shrem brings\nunparalleled access to services and partners within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nCharlie was founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation and co-founded one the the\nfirst and largest Bitcoin companies, BitInstant, in 2011. BitInstant allowed\npeople to efficiently move their money into and within the Bitcoin economy in a\nfast and familiar way. Partnering with MoneyGram, Charlie brought crypto to\npeople’s front door with the ability to deposit cash for Bitcoin at over 700,000\nlocations in the United States at its peak.\n\nHe also is the Business Development Advisor for Changelly, an instant\ncryptocurrency exchange service that let’s you exchange one crypto to another in\nseconds and supports fiat money payment for any listed crypto. Changelly is an\nexchange without accounts that makes moving from one crypto to another fast and\neasy while customers maintain their privacy and control.\n\nCharlie understands making crypto accessible and easy to use.\nHe has relationships around the world with services and exchanges that will\nfurther Particl’s growth and adoption.\n\nA Bright Future\nBuilding the Particl Marketplace for just PART is a big undertaking.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
