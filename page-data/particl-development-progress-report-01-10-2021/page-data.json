This week has been a pretty busy one, and so we\nhave quite a lot to report.\n\nFirst thing first, this week has seen the release of the long-anticipated\nParticl V3 on mainnet, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and Particl\nMarketplace. We're happy to report that the release has gone exceptionally\nsmoothly without any significant issue. A few minor problems have been reported\nconcerning getting listings to show up, but they can be quickly remediated with\na few manual steps that we are working on fixing. The related changes to fix\nthose minor issues should go live pretty soon.\n\nAdditionally, a good portion of this week's focus has been on observing the\nnetwork following the release, keeping an eye on the chat rooms to spot any\nproblem and assist people with difficulties, and also answering many questions\nfrom the community both in the chat rooms, but also in private messages.\n\nParticl V3, now finally on mainnet!However, it's not because a lot of the focus\nhas been around monitoring the release that there hasn't been any significant\nprogress development-wise. In fact, it is quite the contrary; this has been a\npretty productive week. So let's dive deeper into the details.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nA small number of minor updates have been added and queued up for the next\nrelease of Particl Desktop. Thanks to everyone who's provided feedback (and\ncontinue to do so) based on their experience with the initial Particl V3\nrelease.\n\nIn addition, here are the items that have seen progress this week but aren't yet\nfully ready.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21.\n * Allow users to obtain the mnemonic of the marketplace-related wallets for\n   backup purposes.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well).\n * Usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting. \n * Allowing for the sale of digital items with no need for a shipping address to\n   be provided (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.).\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nMost of the work on the core side of things this week has been around fixing\nminor issues related to Core and its interaction with the marketplace. Still,\nthere have also been some pretty interesting independent development.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.15\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.15] and 0.19.2.16\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.16] have been\nreleased to address a few edge issues with Particl Desktop, especially as it\nrelates to improperly shutting down Particl Desktop, which caused, in some\ninstances, problems with syncing the blockchain correctly and loading listings\nas expected. Particl Core 0.19.2.16 will soon be pushed to Particl Desktop;\nyou'll need to shut down the client entirely and re-open it for the update to\napply. \n\nAdditionally, work has gone towards making the Particl Core 0.21 release\ncompatible with Particl Desktop. This, however, is still a work in progress but\nwill mark a significant step towards moving away from the old 0.19 release and\ntowards a more modern one.\n\nFinally, we have exciting news to share in relation to Particl Core 0.22. The\nfirst internal pre-release has been built and is being tested at this very\nmoment. This is the first time a Bitcoin/Particl release uses guix, which treats \nlibudev differently. For this reason, this release, in particular, needs to be\nextensively tested to ensure everything runs as expected. \n\nFor a full list of all the changes being introduced, follow this link\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-22.0.md]\n. In a nutshell, it introduces i2p routing, drops TorV2 addresses for the new\nTorv3 ones, and more necessary code for the full deployment of the\nprivacy-enhancing taproot protocol, which, in Particl's case, is expected to\ncome to play an essential role in BasicSwap notably (to allow for more private\nswaps that are indistinguishable from regular transactions). \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned as the next week is gearing up to be another productive one. The new\nwebsite, and the new roadmap, are both scheduled to be released next week, and\nthey are sure to melt your mind! Keep in mind that, shortly after this, we'll\nalso start publishing a lot more information about Particl's new upcoming app;\nthe BasicSwap DEX.\n\nAs you probably realize by now, things are looking extremely positive for the\nParticl project, its future, and its vision of a decentralized and private\neconomy with no middleman (aka a real and global free market economy). The\nmainnet release of Particl V3 was a major milestone that needed to happen before\njumping right into the next big phase for the project. And now that the release\nis behind us, the real fun begins! \n\nThank you all for your support, passion, and for your valuable contributions.\nThis project would be nothing without all of you who have stuck around through\ntough times. You all have been our life force, and the future of Particl is now\nvery bright. We owe it to you all!\n\nHave a great weekend from the entire Particl team! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

As such, we are happy to release\nthe new updated development roadmap and major milestones ahead of us.\n\nIn this post, we’ll expand on Particl’s vision for the future and break down\nevery roadmap item. We also have a few words on marketing, PR, adoption, and the\nnew website so make sure to read this blog post in full!\n\nTable of Contents\n * Particl V3\n * Roadmap objectives\n * Discover the new roadmap\n * BasicSwap Open Beta\n * Web framework\n * What about marketing?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 – The Foundation of Particl's entire ecosystem\nThe release of Particl V3 on mainnet represents a major milestone for the\nproject. Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which\nthe future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this\nessential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a\nnecessary step in the evolution of the project.\n\nIndeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use\napps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end\nfunctionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply\nput, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of\nthe roadmap items presented today.\n\nRoadmap Objectives\nThe roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.\n\nImprove Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of\naudiences.\nParticl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application\nthat can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course,\nthis is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking\ntechnology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making\nParticl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.\n\nImprove the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.\nBecause Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features,\nfunctionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot\nof sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore,\nthe Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the\ndevelopment of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to\ngenerate adoption.\n\nImprove Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of\nadoption.\nIn a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption\nof the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be\nready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no\ndowntime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the\ncase, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important\nfactor in the conception of this roadmap.\n\nDiscover the New Roadmap\nDue to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different\ncategories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear\ndocument. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at\na time depending on various factors.\n\nTags\nOn the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag\nrepresents a different status.\n\n * Completed: The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant\n   version of it has been deployed.\n * In progress: The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already\n   started being worked on.\n * Research: The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently\n   under research.\n * Ongoing: The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.\n * Later: The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap\n   items in the list.\n * [NO TAG]: The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment,\n   but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX  What?\nA cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps\nand SMSG.\n\nWhy?\nBasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and\nSMSG. It lets you swap a vast number of coins privately without anyone in\nbetween and without paying trading fees. BasicSwap is compatible with multiple\ncoins like PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and more. \n\nIn progress Closed beta SMSG 2.0  What?\nA new version of SMSG that is significantly more scalable.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption increases and more Particl apps use SMSG as its backbone,\nSMSG 2.0 ensures that the network can scale appropriately. This massive update\nwill make it possible to support all current and upcoming Particl apps without\nany scaling issue. \n\nResearch Lightning Network GUI  What?\nA user-friendly interface for Particl's Lightning Network.\n\nWhy?\nParticl's Lightning Network is already live on mainnet, but there's currently no\neasy way to use it. Particl Electrum provides a user-friendly interface for\neveryone to enjoy all the benefits of the Lightning Network; near-infinite\ntransaction scalability, near-zero fees, near-instant settlements, and more. \n\nIn progress Web framework (marketplace on the web)  What?\nA web framework to bring the Particl ecosystem to the web.\n\nWhy?\nFor Particl to gain maximum adoption, it needs to be accessible and operable\nthrough the web. Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the\nmarketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is\nexpected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser\nmay be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e.,\nsearch engine friendly content) will be added over time. \n\nLater Research Encrypted messaging app  What?\nA decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.\n\nWhy?\nThe SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network. With a proper\ninterface, it can be used as a messaging application that's fast, secure,\nunstoppable, uncensorable, and private. This \"chat\" functionality may come in\ndifferent packages over time (i.e., Particl Desktop app, integration into the\nmarketplace, mobile app, etc.). \n\nLater \"Major milestones\" are the most important deliverables of the new roadmap.\nThey are major releases that introduce key functionalities to the Particl\necosystem and craft the path forward. They will massively contribute to\nimproving Particl and its adoption by making it more stable, resilient, private,\nand scalable. \n\nThese milestones are not necessarily intended to be worked on one right after\nthe other. They usually require other roadmap items to be completed before they\ncan be started, meaning the development focus is spread across all roadmap\ncategories and not just this one.\n\nOther Categories\nRoadmap items related to the marketplace, desktop client, SMSG network, or the\nblockchain are grouped into their own categories. They are important features,\nadditions, and improvements to the components and products of the Particl\necosystem that already exist. \n\nAlthough these roadmap items are not included in the \"major milestones\"\ncategory, they are just as important and provide direct value to the ecosystem\nand improves its adoption potential by making it more accessible, usable, and\nfeature-complete.\n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality  What?\nAn improved zap function that gives stakers more flexibility and privacy.\n\nWhy?\nThe new zap function makes it more efficient and confidential to zap funds when\nactivating cold staking. \n\nCompleted Particl Electrum  What?\nA Particl version of the Electrum light wallet, with Lightning Network GUI\nincluded.\n\nWhy?\nElectrum is an easy-to-use and popular light wallet that introduces various\nfeatures and capabilities. One of them is a GUI for using Particl's Lightning\nNetwork. Electrum will not only make it easy to use the Lightning Network, but\nit's also expected to serve as the backbone for future components of the Particl\necosystem. \n\nIn progress Taproot support  What?\nA new protocol that brings new, more efficient, flexible, and private ways to\ntransact PART.\n\nWhy?\nThe Taproot update includes many new features and capabilities, notably in the\narea of privacy. This update is particularly interesting considering the complex\ntransactions generated by Particl's apps like the marketplace and the upcoming\nBasicSwap DEX. Taproot is expected to improve their privacy even more and reduce\nfees. \n\nPending activation Trezor wallet support  What?\nA better support for Trezor hardware devices.\n\nWhy?\nTrezor is a hardware device that lets users safely store coins offline. Having\nnew hardware storage solution for Particl provides users with yet another safe\nway to store coins the way they prefer. \n\nIn progress New blockchain explorers  What?\nThe deployment of new blockchain explorers.\n\nWhy?\nMany different blockchain explorers provide additional data that Particl's\ncurrent primary blockchain explorer (Insight) doesn't. For this reason, having\nmore blockchain explorers opens up the door to new opportunities, such as\nenabling Particl's upcoming web framework. \n\nIn progress Scaling and performance upgrades  What?\nA wide range of planned improvements to make Particl more scalable, stable, and\nfast.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption grows, the ecosystem has to support the increased traffic.\nIt also needs to be able to process a large number of transactions and SMSG\nmessages. Various improvements are planned as part of the regular Particl Core\nupdates to ensure that this is the case. \n\nOngoing PSBT support  What?\nA unified and more advanced multi-signature format.\n\nWhy?\nPSBT is a more modern multi-signature protocol that improves on current\nmulti-signature solutions. It makes it easier to use for wallets and nodes, and\nmakes it compatible across more devices. PSBT also enables better CoinJoin-like\nfunctionality. \n\nShamir's secret-sharing for mnemonics (SSS)  What?\nAn improvement to how mnemonics work in deterministic wallets.\n\nWhy?\nSSS is a new, improved format for deterministic wallet mnemonics that \"splits a\nmaster secret into unique parts which can be distributed among participants. A\nspecified minimum number of parts is required to be supplied in order to\nreconstruct the original secret. Knowledge of fewer than the required number of\nparts does not leak information about the master secret.\" \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import  What?\nMore features to the current inventory import tool. Includes importing images,\ncategories, product codes, and more right from a CSV file.\n\nWhy?\nMakes it easier and less time-consuming for large-scale vendors to open shop on\nParticl Marketplace. Currently, many operations still require a manual,\none-by-one operation which is a tedious process for vendors with hundreds of\nlistings. \n\nIn progress Additional shipping and delivery options  What?\nAdditional shipping and delivery options to satisfy more needs (per country\nshipping costs, digital item deliveries, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nAdding more shipping options helps sellers charge a more accurate shipping cost\ndepending on the buyer's location and shipping preference. This roadmap item\nalso includes new delivery methods for digital items, such as buyers providing a\ncrypto address (i.e., NFTs) or a user code/username, for example. \n\nIn progress Escrow improvements  What?\nA wide range of escrow improvements to satisfy more use-cases.\n\nWhy?\nAt this time, escrow is mandatory on all transactions and requires a 100%\nsecurity deposit rate. However, its current form may not be ideal for all types\nof transactions, sellers, and buyers. For this reason, a wide range of escrow\nimprovements and options are planned to be deployed. This includes making escrow\noptional and introducing new features like an auto-destroy timer, an\nauto-complete timer, an adjustable security deposit requirement, partial\nrefunds, and automation to reduce the number of steps required in the buy flow.\nAll these escrow features are optional, leaving users with multiple options to\nsatisfy their needs. \n\nIn progress Research Advanced inventory management  What?\nAn inventory management tool that lets sellers indicate the quantity in stock\nfor each of their listings. It also lets them set up variants for items with\nmultiple purchasing options (i.e., color, size, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nThis tool significantly improves the marketplace by introducing a key e-commerce\nfeature to specify the number of available quantities. In addition, instead of\ncreating multiple listings of the same item, sellers with products containing\nvariants (i.e., storage size for USB keys) will be able to let buyers choose\ntheir purchasing preferences from a single listing. \n\nNew types of order  What?\nAdded support for new types of orders, such as bidding auctions.\n\nWhy?\nAllows the marketplace to provide a different experience for different types of\nusers, products, and niches. For example, the art industry heavily uses bidding\nauctions and may be more inclined to use the marketplace if this feature is\nenabled. \n\nPrice pegging and custom display  What?\nThe ability to dynamically adjust and display listing prices based on the value\nof other currencies (i.e., USD).\n\nWhy?\nDue to PART's price fluctuation, many users may prefer pricing and viewing\nlistings based on different currencies (i.e., USD, EUR, BTC). This roadmap item\ndepends on price oracles, which is a future functionality provided by Particl\nDesktop plugins (SMSG bots). \n\nLater Reputation system  What?\nA reputation system, best used in combination with Particl's escrow.\n\nWhy?\nBefore transacting, both the seller and the buyer want to ensure that the other\nparty is trustworthy. A reputation system is a tool that helps with making that\nassessment. It provides additional information about the other user and, when\ncombined with Particl's unique escrow system, offers a strong level of\nconfidence and protection when trading with strangers. \n\nLater Research Buy flow messaging  What?\nThe ability to talk with the other participant during a marketplace transaction.\n\nWhy?\nThere are a lot of situations where both participants of a marketplace\ntransaction may want to communicate together. Whether that's for asking a\nquestion before buying, providing an update, or dealing with a shipping issue, a\nbuilt-in messaging system massively improves the user experience and helps\nresolve order-related issues. \n\nAdditional market permissions  What?\nThe ability for a market owner to set special permissions for other users.\n\nWhy?\nA market owner may want to make their market or storefront invite-only, or they\nmay wish to elect moderators. This feature makes community markets and\nstorefronts more versatile, leading to more potential use-cases. \n\nResearch Moderation system update  What?\nImprovements to the marketplace's moderation system.\n\nWhy?\nAs no central authority has the power to control the marketplace and its\ncontent, the community is the one in charge of moderation. The current system is\na basic process that lets anyone flag undesirable content. Several improvements\nare being considered, notably in relation to cold staking pools and AI systems.\nImproving the moderation system and its capabilities will make it more effective\nand lead to more people using it. \n\nResearch Webhook integrations  What?\nThe ability for Particl Marketplace to connect with third-party services.\n\nWhy?\nWhile the marketplace is entirely decentralized, users can manually add\nthird-party services through app extensions and plugins. Webhook integrations\nare such services that can be manually added. They allow the marketplace to\nconnect to external platforms that provide services like inventory management,\naccounting, external notifications, etc. Any platform or person can deploy their\nown integration; the possibilities are endless. \n\nIn progress Other DSN integrations (i.e., IPFS)  What?\nThe ability to host large-size content like images on different data network\nsystems (DSN).\n\nWhy?\nImages make up for the majority of the data contained in SMSG messages. Hosting\nlarge-size content on external networks clears a lot of space on the SMSG\nnetwork, allowing it to scale better and be more efficient. Additionally, other\nDSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG,\nopening up the doors to more opportunities. \n\nResearch Stable payments  What?\nA way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.\n\nWhy?\nPART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users,\nespecially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve\nthe stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a\nmajor improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability.\nThis is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a\nnear-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be\nintegrated on Particl Desktop using plugins. \n\nLater Research Other features and improvements  What?\nA wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.\n\nWhy?\nA wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part\nof Particl Desktop's regular release schedule. These additions usually take less\ntime to get ready and can come up due to user feedback or problems encountered.\nA few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown\nformatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options,\noptional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time. The\nteam wants to keep a flexible approach to development and expects a few features\nand improvements to require to be added suddenly. \n\nOngoing Desktop\nSMSG controller  What?\nA system that allows apps and developers to interact with the SMSG network more\neffectively.\n\nWhy?\nA streamlined process for interacting with the SMSG network is required for apps\nand developers to easily and safely interact with the SMSG network. The SMSG\nmanager also provides various failsafe mechanisms and massively increases SMSG's\ncompatibility with future apps other than the marketplace. It's an important\nstep towards making Particl more developer-friendly. \n\nCore and Desktop separation  What?\nBetter separation of Particl Core and Particl Desktop.\n\nWhy?\nMaking Particl Desktop even more independent of Particl Core makes the client\nmore efficient. This improves the quality of the code making other features and\nfunctionalities easier to maintain and deploy. \n\nApp extensions and plugins  What?\nSupport for app extensions and plugins to provide third-party functionalities to\nthe desktop client.\n\nWhy?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized network and functions without any\nthird-party intervention. However, intermediaries may provide helpful services\nand features that may benefit users (i.e., data oracles, crypto swap services,\netc.). The app extension and plugin system lets anyone broadcast and add\nthird-party services on Particl Desktop. \n\nCore configuration editor  What?\nA system that lets users modify configuration settings, such as easily enabling\nTor routing.\n\nWhy?\nManually editing Particl Core configuration files can provide a lot of extra\nfunctionalities to users, but it can also break things in unexpected ways. A\nconfig management system lets the user tweak these low-level settings without\nany potential issue. This can be useful, for example, to easily connect to the\nTor network. \n\nIn progress Wallet encryption options  What?\nThe ability to delete the encryption of a wallet or change its password.\n\nWhy?\nThere are many situations where a user may want to delete the encryption of a\nwallet or change its password. This is what this roadmap item introduces. \n\nBetter cold staking functionality  What?\nMove staking and cold staking to a separate section or app.\n\nWhy?\nMaking a separate section or app for staking (and cold staking) allows for a\nbetter way to provide more options and features. This makes staking and cold\nstaking more intuitive and powerful. \n\nOS notifications  What?\nThe addition of various push notifications to the user's operating system.\n\nWhy?\nReceiving notifications through your operating system lets you stay connected\nand up-to-date with what's going on with your Particl-related activities.\nNotifications can be pushed for many different events such as a marketplace\norder update, an inbound PART transaction, a completed escrow, etc. \n\nWant to Suggest a New Feature or Improvement?\nYour feedback and ideas are incredibly valuable! If you have any feature,\nimprovement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know\nabout it.\n\nSimply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., Particl Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] or Particl Core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues]), and create a new issue with\nthe \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer\nwill see your suggestion.\n\nKeep Track of Things\nTo keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every\nweek on Friday, a development progress report on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the\ndevelopments and updates. \n\nThis roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new Particl.io\n[https://Particl.io/] website. It will be regularly updated as new items are\nadded, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. \n\nBasicSwap Open Beta\nBasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a\ncross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the\nSMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC,\nand others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed\nbeta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having\ntaken place during the last few weeks.\n\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required\ntweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it\ncan be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.\n\nAs we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect\nmuch more information about it to be released shortly on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become\ninvincible!\n\nWeb Framework\nMaking Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the\nweb with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making\nParticl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of\nadoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.\n\nHowever, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other\nvital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more\nfunctional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential\nroadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more\nimmediate focus.\n\nAdditionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as\nalternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required\nto fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as\n\"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate\npriority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. \n\nJust like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information\nabout it when its time comes.\n\nWhat About Marketing?\nNow that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on\nmainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness\ncampaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few\ninitiatives already being live and with many more in line.\n\nOn that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about\nParticl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and\nadoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on\nParticl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the\nplatform successful.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nstill in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and\ncomplicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is\nintended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the\naudiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with\nthe features available at the time.\n\nThe New Website is Key\nThe new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is\nwhere newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are\nthe most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's\nmost crucial marketing statement.\n\nTo that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one,\nimproving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much\nclearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on\nParticl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the\nproject has to offer to them.\n\nWe are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the\nconversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in\nmaking future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.\n\n> Note: Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new\nwebsite release to next week. One of our team members involved with its\ndevelopment has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several\ndays this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time.\nThis team member is now recovering fine.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser may be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e., search engine friendly content) will be added over time.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Encrypted messaging app</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            The SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network.

Hosting large-size content on external networks clears a lot of space on the SMSG network, allowing it to scale better and be more efficient. Additionally, other DSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG, opening up the doors to more opportunities.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck13\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck13\">Stable payments</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            PART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users, especially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve the stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a major improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability. This is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a near-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be integrated on Particl Desktop using plugins.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck14\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck14\">Other features and improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            A wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part of Particl Desktop's regular release schedule.

A few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown formatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options, optional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time.

If you have any feature, improvement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know about it.</p><p>Simply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Particl Desktop</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\">Particl Core</a>), and create a new issue with the \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer will see your suggestion.</p><h3 id=\"keep-track-of-things\">Keep Track of Things</h3><p>To keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every week on Friday, a development progress report on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the developments and updates. </p><p>This roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new <a href=\"https://Particl.io/\">Particl.io</a> website. It will be regularly updated as new items are added, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. </p><h2 id=\"basicswap-open-beta\">BasicSwap Open Beta</h2><p>BasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag represents a different status.</p><ul><li><strong>Completed: </strong>The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant version of it has been deployed.</li><li><strong>In progress:</strong> The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already started being worked on.</li><li><strong>Research:</strong> The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently under research.</li><li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.</li><li><strong>Later:</strong> The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap items in the list.</li><li><strong>[NO TAG]:</strong> The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment, but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>Major Milestones</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            BasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally.

Additionally, other DSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG, opening up the doors to more opportunities.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck13\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck13\">Stable payments</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            PART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users, especially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve the stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a major improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability. This is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a near-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be integrated on Particl Desktop using plugins.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck14\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck14\">Other features and improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            A wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part of Particl Desktop's regular release schedule.

A few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown formatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options, optional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time.

If you have any feature, improvement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know about it.</p><p>Simply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Particl Desktop</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\">Particl Core</a>), and create a new issue with the \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer will see your suggestion.</p><h3 id=\"keep-track-of-things\">Keep Track of Things</h3><p>To keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every week on Friday, a development progress report on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the developments and updates. </p><p>This roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new <a href=\"https://Particl.io/\">Particl.io</a> website. It will be regularly updated as new items are added, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. </p><h2 id=\"basicswap-open-beta\">BasicSwap Open Beta</h2><p>BasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Now that Particl’s free, unrestricted, and private\nmarketplace has arrived, it’s time to make some noise know about it!\n\nWith the renewal of funding for the team, we have begun to gradually ramp up\nmarketing, promotional, and strategical efforts to turn Particl Marketplace into\na busy place.\n\nNew Website About to Go Live\nAs part of these efforts, we're launching, next week, the first version of\nParticl’s new website. This new website is expected to grow and evolve in the\nweeks to come and aims at better communicating Particl’s vision of a free,\nunrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman, along with\nall the benefits it unlocks.\n\nNew Roadmap\nThe team has established a new roadmap for technical development, marketing, and\nbusiness development. It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and\nobjectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog\npost this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021. We’ve mentioned it a few\ntimes already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re\nconvinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take\nParticl to the next level.\n\nBasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX\nAs occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve\nbeen making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl:\nBasicSwap.\n\nBasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps\nand Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means\nthat it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain\nto another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment\nprocessor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people\nand are inherently private and autonomous.\n\nBasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but\nalready running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly. So\nkeep your eyes fixated on Particl News as we soon begin to publish more\ninformation about it.\n\nMuch More to Come\nThe points mentioned above are sure exciting, but it’s far from the only things\nbeing cooked up at the moment. You can expect more promotional efforts,\ninitiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come. While we\ndon’t want to repeat ourselves too much, the fun is getting started, and the\nbest is yet to come!\n\nYou are the Pioneer!\nThere’s never been a better time to get active and introduce others to the\nworld's most revolutionary marketplace. We need all the buyers and seller we can\nget! So let’s all discuss it with friends and families, in your communities, and\non the web, in places you feel would benefit the most from a fair, unrestricted,\nand private e-commerce environment with no middleman. We are ALL what makes\nParticl happen!\n\nAnd don’t forget! To make it easier, the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/] is there to help you out when introducing Particl\nto others. With its help on your side, you can now turn anybody into a Particl\npro and quickly get them started.\n\nFinally, we highly encourage you to support our current pioneering vendors by\nbuying items from them or referring others to Particl Marketplace.

Now that Particl’s free, unrestricted, and private marketplace has arrived, it’s time to make some noise know about it!</p><p>With the renewal of funding for the team, we have begun to gradually ramp up marketing, promotional, and strategical efforts to turn Particl Marketplace into a busy place.</p><h2 id=\"new-website-about-to-go-live\">New Website About to Go Live</h2><p>As part of these efforts, we're launching, next week, the first version of Particl’s new website. This new website is expected to grow and evolve in the weeks to come and aims at better communicating Particl’s vision of a free, unrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman, along with all the benefits it unlocks.</p><h2 id=\"new-roadmap\">New Roadmap</h2><p>The team has established a new roadmap for technical development, marketing, and business development. It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and objectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog post <strong>this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021</strong>. We’ve mentioned it a few times already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re convinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take Particl to the next level.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-atomic-swap-dex\">BasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX</h2><p>As occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve been making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl: BasicSwap.</p><p>BasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps and Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means that it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain to another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment processor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people and are inherently private and autonomous.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1000w, /glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1435w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>BasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but already running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly. So keep your eyes fixated on Particl News as we soon begin to publish more information about it.</p><h2 id=\"much-more-to-come\">Much More to Come</h2><p>The points mentioned above are sure exciting, but it’s far from the only things being cooked up at the moment. You can expect more promotional efforts, initiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come. While we don’t want to repeat ourselves too much, the fun is getting started, and the best is yet to come!</p><h1 id=\"you-are-the-pioneer-\">You are the Pioneer!</h1><p>There’s never been a better time to get active and introduce others to the world's most revolutionary marketplace. We need all the buyers and seller we can get! So let’s all discuss it with friends and families, in your communities, and on the web, in places you feel would benefit the most from a fair, unrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman. We are ALL what makes Particl happen!</p><p>And don’t forget! To make it easier, the <strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/\">Particl Academy</a></strong> is there to help you out when introducing Particl to others. With its help on your side, you can now turn anybody into a Particl pro and quickly get them started.</p><p>Finally, we highly encourage you to support our current pioneering vendors by buying items from them or referring others to Particl Marketplace.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
