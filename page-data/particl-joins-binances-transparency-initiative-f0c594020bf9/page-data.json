Devices, apps,\nnetworks, and retailers are becoming increasingly talkative with each other, and\nit just so happens that the topic of conversation is, well, you.\n\nSwimming in an Ocean of Data\nIf you look closely, there’s a common thread between your phone and that\nseemingly innocuous browser ad plugging Nike shoes the day after you visited a\nNike shop. Your live data runs straight into the clutches of the data-harvesting\napps populating your devices, manifesting itself later on in the form of eerily\naccurate ads and suggestions.\n\nAs life becomes increasingly digital, you’re leaving a virtual trail with each\nmove. Every moment of every day, your devices log your actions, save the data,\nand sell it to the highest bidder. Your hour-long stop at Whole Foods grocery\nstore after work, the route you took to get there, the Spotify playlist you\nlistened to on the drive, the Amazon Prime purchase you made — none of it goes\nunrecorded, and all of it is sold by the very apps, networks, and devices you\ntrust.\n\nYour data forms countless streams that funnel into an invisible ocean of data.\nThat is true for anyone who regularly accesses the internet, uses apps, or owns\na smartphone. While some of it can’t be readily interpreted just yet (such as\nyour Instagram photos and voice messages), the technology for mining it is\nrapidly maturing.\n\nIt’s All in the Fine Print — Or, Is It?\nThe obvious question to ask is — who wants this data, and why?\n\nFor retailers, governments, and social networks, getting to know you is a\nlucrative business. Your raw personal data translates directly into money and \npower for internet giants like Facebook, who benefit immensely from doing\nsketchy things like recording your conversations and phone calls.\n\nAs the world’s leading data broker, Acxiom buys data wholesale and unloads it to\nother businesses for consumer targeting. After clearing over $1 billion in sales\nlast year, Acxiom sold their company for $2 billion. All of that profit is built\nfrom data you generated — your personal experience, whether on the web or\notherwise, is no longer yours because you don’t own it.\n\nSome argue that because of the fine print in the terms and conditions when you\ncreate app accounts, all of this is known. However, did you agree to the box\nthat said Facebook would sell your data to a company using it to interfere in\nelections throughout the world? Of course not, because that box wasn’t an\noption. That didn’t stop Facebook from selling the personal data of 87 million\nusers to Cambridge Analytica, a company directly implicated in using it to\ninfluence the outcome of the 2016 US election.\n\nCan You Really Control What Happens of Your Data?\nAmazon, the world’s largest online retailer, allows third-party sellers on its\nplatform. Over 30% of those sellers are China-based and use payment platforms\nsuch as LianLian. Payment processors have direct access to a seller’s account\nand can, therefore, collect buyer data as well. With a massive share of the\nworld’s largest retail network, Chinese payment processors have every incentive\nto harvest and sell your data for additional revenue.\n\nQuora, Uber, Equifax, eBay, Google, T-Mobile, Microsoft, and countless other\napps, services, and platforms used worldwide are all cashing in on the big data\nbusiness that is worth, all told, an estimated $250 billion a year.\n\nWhen your data is sold, it isn’t tagged or tracked. It flows down the bottomless\nrabbit holes of the internet, and where it ends up is anyone’s guess. One\ncompany may use your data for micro-targeting while another uses it to fuel its\npredictive analytics.\n\nThe moment you do anything that can be digitally represented, that action is\ntransmuted into data and immediately trades hands.\n\n> …your personal experience, whether on the web or otherwise, is no longer yours\nbecause you don’t own it.\nTo make matters even worse, companies all along the data-mining supply chain are\noften targeted by hackers. Since data storage is a relatively recent phenomenon,\nit’s also very loosely regulated and lacks guidelines for the protection of\nsensitive information. When a breach occurs, stolen data that includes your\nbanking details, home address, text messages, phone numbers, transactions,\nlocation history, and more is at risk of being used against you.\n\nAs the scandals surrounding data have grown in scale, so too has the push to\nmake each of us the rightful owners of our data.\n\nAre Decentralized Marketplaces a Better Way?\nData-mining is by and large done with the specific intention of getting better\nat selling you things. The more retailers know about what you want, the better\nthey can hone in on you and convince you to spend. This is specifically why the\neCommerce sector has become so keen on data mining.\n\nThanks to Satoshi and the blockchain, a new form of marketplace has risen over\nthe last few years. Did you know Satoshi had begun working on a decentralized\nmarketplace\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab77fab1995ede03fb934edd67f1359ba8]\n, entirely built on Bitcoin, before disappearing?\n\nDecentralized marketplaces look and feel like their centralized counterparts,\nbut they’re intended to give you full control over your data and, therefore,\ncomplete privacy. However, do they really improve upon the problem they’re\nsupposed to fix — or do they make it worse?\n\nDecentralized marketplaces run on public blockchains. The key word here is \npublic— meaning that your valuable information can be tracked and harvested by\nanyone with access to a block explorer. Complicating the situation are\nblockchain analytics firms that have become sophisticated enough to track down\nyour full transaction history, IP address, and personal details.\n\nDubious blockchain analytics startups are being bought out en masse by\nexchanges\nlike Coinbase\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com] \nwhile others breeze through high-dollar funding rounds. Data-mining has already\nproven to be extremely lucrative in the traditional e-commerce world, and\nblockchain has shown itself a worthy of replacing traditional networks. If you\nput two and two together, the reason for the current blockchain analytics gold\nrush is clear as day.\n\nToday’s blockchain analytics firms are tomorrow’s big data-harvesting\ncenters — and decentralized marketplaces without privacy measures in place won’t\nbe safe.\n\nTowards a Decentralized AND Private Marketplace\nInspired by the decentralized marketplace forebearers such as OpenBazaar, it\nseems that the only answer to the assault on our privacy is to take the\nblockchain marketplace model a step further and make it private by default.\n\nParticl [https://particl.io] is a blockchain analysis-resistant marketplace that\nis both decentralized and private. Your transaction details and identity are\nkept entirely anonymous — no one, no matter how hard they try, can collect your\ndata when you use the Particl platform.\n\nThat means your data is yours— it’ll never end up as runoff trickling into a\nmurky data silo someplace. Sure, we’ve heard critics claim that if you’ve got\nnothing to hide, then there’s no use for privacy. Unfortunately, such arguments\nmiss the point.\n\nBy hiding your data when buying or selling online, you aren’t implicitly\nadmitting to shady activity. You’re reclaiming the value inherent in your data\nand strengthening your digital autonomy. In the physical world, you wouldn’t\nstand for being followed or robbed — so why let those things happen to your\ndigital self?\n\nIn the digital era, data ownership is a fundamental human right, but we need the\ntools and resources for exercising that right. Particl Open Marketplace is just\nsuch a resource, and by using it, you stand up for not only your data but also\nthat of your peers.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Privacy-in-eCommerce---The-Need-to-Own-Your-Data/1-WppvYxW6cEpVySkXEJRezQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The world is an interconnected, nay, <em>hyper-connected</em> place.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
