Thank you!\n\nHey guys,\n\nI’ve been following an interesting cryptocurrency project for some time and have\nnoticed that very little information was available about it online, so I’ve\ndecided to write a complete in-depth presentation of it. I do believe this\nproject has a lot of potential investment-wise due to its great technology and\nvision, this is why I wanted to share it with you. This article is going to be\nquite lengthy, so buckle up.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is Particl?\nTo sum it up briefly, Particl is a privacy-focused blockchain/P2P hybrid\necosystem that will host a decentralized and anonymous marketplace as well as an\narray of Dapps using a native cryptocurrency. The first officially supported\nParticl Dapp will be a fully decentralized and anonymous marketplace which\nallows buyers and vendors to securely transact between each other without the\nneed to ever interact with a third-party. It also encompasses a fully anonymous\nmessaging system built similarly to BitMessage. The platform is currency and\nprotocol agnostic (more details on what this means later in the presentation).\n\nNote, however, that these Dapps are not the same kind of Dapps as on Ethereum.\nThey do NOT work using smart contracts but are instead hard-coded into the\nclient. This makes Dapps much more secure and efficient.\n\nWhat’s Its History?\nParticl is the successor of the ShadowProject (https://shadowproject.io/en), a\nprivacy-focused cryptocurrency project started back in August 2014. The team\nbehind this project are known for being innovators in the cryptocurrency scene,\nbeing the first to produce many feats such as an HTML5 wallet, a staking mobile\nwallet with encrypted messaging and transactions, as well as having the first\nring signature and HD wallet implementation on BTC codebase. Their Umbra\ngraphical wallet, built using HTML5, is widely known in the “altcoin” community\nfor being absolutely gorgeous and very user-friendly. It was not so long after\nswitching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that this very capable team\nstarted working on a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. This has\nlong been seen has the ultimate value proposition of the Shadowcash blockchain.\n\nBack in late December 2016, word spread around the community that the\nShadowProject team had met with major partners in Hong Kong and that big things\nwere coming regarding the way forward. Then, on March 17th, the team announced\nthey were leaving the ShadowProject to start working on a new and more\nprofessional project: Particl. This move was encouraged by the fact that the\nteam wanted to have a more professional branding and were looking for funding so\nthat they could work full-time on it and get it going for good. In fact, they\nhad been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms,\nthat the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to\nassociate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the\nproject also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC\nblockchain/client and team structure. It is for all these reasons the SDC team\ndecided to completely sever the link between Shadowcash and Particl and start\nthe new blockchain from scratch, using their final Umbra release as prototype\nfor the new platform.\n\nThe Particl Foundation\nThe Particl Foundation is a registered Swiss legal entity. As the Particl team\nwas looking to raise money to fund the project, they needed to have a legal body\nthat could receive the funds and spend on behalf of the project. It is also\nrequired for most of the logistics of the project (hiring and paying employees,\npaying hosting fees for the website, etc.) as well as interacting with\nthird-parties (partners, exchanges, gateways, legal & PR firm contracts, etc.).\nThere will be many more details to come once the Foundation is officially\nregistered. It is currently awaiting approval by the Swiss government and it is\nthe last step to be up and running.\n\nAs a funding strategy, the Particl team offered SDC holders an opportunity to\nswap their SDCs for PARTs at a 1:1 rate, with the possibility for the holder to\nadd an additional amount of BTC to the swap transaction to get a variable PART\nbonus added to their stash. This extra BTC is what the team collected as funding\nas SDCs sent into swap transactions were not and will never be sold into the\nmarket.\n\nThey have raised 750,000 USD worth of Bitcoin (now worth around 1.4M), and\nreserved for themselves 513,502 PARTs (6% of total supply) from the total\nsupply. Another 996,000 PARTs are reserved for a second funding round once the\nMVP of the market is out and released. The funds they raised will be used for\nsalaries, legal expenses for Swiss Foundation creation, initial business\nconsultation expenses, new team members, professional PR, third-party code\naudits and University grants.\n\nWhile it may have been tempting to raise more money, the reasoning behind this\ncrowdfund structure is actually quite sane. The total amount raised is what the\nteam estimated were necessary to run the project for one full year. It is true\nthat other ICOs are raising tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, but\nin many cases, the development team simply doesn’t need that much money. It\ncould be argued that as these projects raise tons of money, they lose a certain\nincentive to work hard on their project as they have already cashed out on their\nidea. In more traditional VC environments, you would very rarely (if ever) see\nprojects raise hundreds of millions of dollars with only ideas, vague\nwhitepaper, and no working products. It is also likely that some of these\nprojects will attract the attention of regulatory bodies due to questionable\nfunding methods.\n\nThe Particl team has mimicked the VC way of initially going through a seed round\nbefore going for a larger round of funding. This crowdfund strategy is what was\nadvised by Swiss legal firms which are used to working with blockchain projects.\nAlso, not only does this structure allows for a fair money-raising method, it\nalso incentivizes the Particl team to work hard on their project and deliver a\nworking product that will impress the community. After all, they will want to\nraise as much money as possible in the second round, and with a maximum of\n996,000 PARTs that can be offered, they have all the reasons in the world to\nmake a good product which would bring more value to the Particl coin. When we\nthink about it, this crowdfunds/ICO was pretty fair and exemplary from a legal\nstandpoint.\n\nParticl Features\nQuick video presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU\n\nRelease date: July 17th 2017, 13:00 UTC\n[https://particl.news/particl-blockchain-will-launch-monday-july-17th-2017-at-13-00-utc-3348e8958657]\n\nCurrency name: Particl (not to be confused with Particle)\n\nCurrency ticker: PART (not PRT, which is Particle’s ticker)\n\nSupported by: Particl Foundation (Swiss Foundation)\n\nTotal supply: 8,634,140 PARTs\n\nParticl Foundation ownership: 513,502 PARTs (6%)\n\nFirst funding round contributors ownership: 7,124,638 PARTs (82.5%)\n\nFunds time-locked for 2nd funding round: 996,000 (11.5%)\n\nNetwork consensus: Proof-of-stake (PoSv3)\n\nBlock time: 120 sec\n\nBlock size: ~2mb\n\nInflation: 5% year 1, 4% year 2, 3% year 3, 2% year 4+\n\nAvailable on: Windows, OSX, Linux and ARM (Raspberry PI, BeagleBone Black, etc)\n\nBitcoin Codebase\nParticl is a privacy platform using its own native currency, PART. It is built\non top of the latest Bitcoin codebase (0.14.2) on which the dev team added as\nmuch as 100,000 new lines of code (as of the time of this publication) to turn\nit into a completely unique coin filled with a ton of cool features. Bitcoin is\nthe first cryptocurrency to ever exist, it is the coin that everyone knows how\nto work with and also the most battle tested blockchain. For these reasons, it\ncould easily be argued that Bitcoin has the safest codebase on which to build on\ntop of.\n\nSome other features inherited from the current Bitcoin codebase version include\n(but is not limited to) HD wallets, multi-sig addresses (fully integrated into\ngraphical wallet), block pruning (saves quite a lot of disk space after the\nchain is fully synced), fast syncing, easy tor setup, watch-only wallet support,\nlibsecp256k1 signing and signature validation, direct headers announcement,\nnotifications through ZMQ, compact block support and ARM builds. You can read\nthis article to get more information on these features: \nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/\n\nDual Token System\nWhy should we have to choose between privacy and convenience when we can have\nboth on the same chain? This is the premise behind one of the major changes the\nteam has made to the Bitcoin codebase: a dual token system. Particl uses two\ndifferent tokens that can seamlessly be transferred for one another. One of\nthese is a public token, which carries the same pseudo-anonymity characteristics\nas Bitcoin, while the second one is a completely anonymous and private coin.\nUsers can easily send public coins into private balances, and the wallet\nautomatically converts the public coin into a private coin. The same can be done\nif a user sends a private coin into a public address. Sending a private token to\na private address successfully “mixes” your coins and allows you to maintain\ntop-of-the-line privacy. Note that it will be very easy and effortless to do\nthese conversions within the GUI wallet.\n\nPublic Token\nWhile Particl is mainly a privacy-focused project, the use of a public token\n(default token) is very important in terms of management, integration, and\nsecurity.\nOne of the problems with exclusively anonymous currencies is that it can be hard\nto confirm the authenticity of the block creation process. What if an attacker\nhad the key to generate an infinite amount of coins? What if no one noticed the\nhack until the attacker dumps large orders of fraudulently created coins on the\ntrading market? These are very serious threats that are a reality with some of\nthe 100% private coins. ZK SNARKS, for example, a crypto privacy protocol, also\nhas this “hidden inflation problem”. In fact, the chain is initially generated\nfrom a set of master keys which could theoretically be used to generate an\ninfinite amount of coins at any time without anyone ever noticing. This is why\npeople say this protocol relies on “trusted setups”; you actually need to trust\nthe party who spawned the chain would successfully destroy the master keys.\nThere is, of course, no way to know for sure whether they didn’t keep copies\nsomewhere or that they were not compromised during any step of the process\n(software, hardware, network, OS, BIOS, ME chip exploits). After all,\ncryptocurrencies are now worth a lot and they have become the primary target for\nhackers around the world.\n\nIt is precisely for these reasons that the Particl team opted for a fully\ntransparent coin generation process. Because all newly generated coins are\npublic, a hacker/bug would instantly be detected and measures could be taken to\nfix the problem.\n\nAdditionally, since the public token is built in a very similar way as Bitcoin,\nit is much easier for third-parties such as exchanges, websites, and wallets\n(Jaxx, Exodus, Ledger Wallet, etc.) to integrate. They do not need to go out of\ntheir way and spend many dev hours without knowing if it will be economically\nworth it to integrate that coin. The best example I could find concerning this,\nin particular, is the case of Monero and Jaxx. Jaxx is a well-known\nmulti-cryptocurrency wallet and they tried to integrate Monero earlier this\nyear. After trying to add the coin to their wallet, they announced they would\nfinally not do it because it was too complicated and they didn’t feel the amount\nof dev time required for this project would be worth it. This would not happen\nwith Particl as the BTC codebase is what everybody is used to working with and\ncan integrate it without much effort.\n\nThis public token is also very useful for people who do not necessarily require\na permanently anonymous experience. Fully-anonymous currencies can sometimes\nhinder one’s ability to effectively keep track of financial records and\ntransactions. Some services ask for extra information (i.e. a payment ID for\nMonero) in order for a transaction to be accepted and there are many situations\nwhere one could forget to note that transaction ID down or lose it afterward.\nThere’s also a lot of scenarios where one would need to go back several months\ninto the past to see specific transaction details. In most cases, it is simply\nharder to keep track of things with fully private coins so having one that does\npossess great accountability tools is definitively a plus.\n\nOn top of this, a transaction using any privacy coin is generally going to cost\nmore in fees than a public transaction on a non-bloated BTC codebase currency as\nit typically involves more data movement and computation. A “public user”, one\nthat does not necessarily want to be anonymous, should not have to pay for\nprivacy features he does not need. By making the public token the default coin,\nthis ensures that only users seeking privacy options will use the privacy token,\nwhile the public users (which will probably end up being the majority of Particl\nusers if the platform becomes mainstream) default to the public token. This also\nhas the non-negligible effect of putting less stress on the network (as public\ntransactions are more lightweight and do not fill blocks as much as private\nones), keeping the network efficient.\n\nPrivate Token\nParticl’s private token has a variable degree of privacy which can be adjusted\nby users according to their preferences. In fact, when making a private\ntransaction, it is possible to send it using Confidential Transactions or RingCT\n(which is a blend of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions). It is\nnoteworthy to mention that this is the first time both these protocols are being\nimplemented on the Bitcoin codebase. While a few coins use Confidential\nTransactions as their privacy protocol, only one uses an implementation of\nRingCT on their main net: Monero.\n\nConfidential Transactions, or CT, is a privacy protocol initially developed for\nBitcoin that hides amounts sent from the public and makes it visible only to\nparties involved in the actual transaction. While it is very efficient to\nobfuscate most regular person-to-person transactions, its most interesting use\ncase is when used in Particl’s marketplace decentralized escrow system. As a\nmatter of fact, if the market’s escrow system worked using the public token, it\nwould be trivial for determined attackers to detect patterns in the public\nescrow contracts and match them to potential users. On a long enough timeline,\nusers could be identified with particular marketplace orders with a high degree\nof certainty. With the help of Confidential Transactions, this cuts off this\nattack vector and makes the escrow system fully anonymous. To learn more about\nCT, please consult this link: \nhttps://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt\n\nRingCT, on the other side, is an even better privacy protocol combining ring\nsignatures to the aforementioned confidential transaction protocol. Applied on\ndouble stealth addresses, not only transaction amounts are hidden but the sender\nand receiver addresses as well, making RingCT transactions completely\nuntraceable. It should be taken into consideration that RingCT will not be\navailable when Particl first launches, but will it be implemented soon enough.\nThis feature is currently on testnet #3, but it still requires some work before\nit is incorporated into the main chain. The team also wants to have it fully\naudited by a third-party before going live with it.\n\nOne useful feature of the Particl wallet is that users are actually presented\nwith the option to choose the privacy protocol they want to use according to\ntheir needs. CT is a good privacy protocol for basic privacy, but RingCT is even\nbetter as it makes transactions unlinkable. However, the latter is much more\nexpensive in fees than the first one, and people who do not require a “paranoid”\nlevel of privacy may not want to pay larger fees.\n\nIn my subjective opinion, Particl will offer the best privacy experience on the\nmarket as it is very flexible but makes no compromise. RingCT is considered\ntop-of-the-line technology and it simply works fantastically in preserving one’s\nprivacy. Some could argue that ZK-SNARKS offers a better solution, and that is\nrightfully debatable. They do offer an interesting privacy solution, but they do\nhave their share of problems and vulnerabilities as mentioned above. Centralized\ncoin mixers are obviously not to be trusted as there is no way to know the\nlegitimacy of the website owner, and coinjoin services are demonstrably weak and\nexploitable by determined adversaries.\n\nThe hidden inflation problem is also one of the reasons why I believe Particl,\nwith its dual token system, has a “safer” (and easier to integrate)\nimplementation of RingCT than Monero. Don’t get me wrong, there are good\narguments people could make about Monero having the better integration. For\nexample, RingCT being mandatory and by default on all transactions makes it\nimpossible to make a basic human mistake (they do happen), but it also makes\nMonero a more expensive currency to use and a blockchain less likely to be able\nto support a huge influx of users (as transactions are heavy and would bloat the\nblockchain faster). This is the kind of debate where both sides have pros and\ncons, so I will let you make your own conclusion on this topic.\n\nAlso related to Particl’s privacy but not its private coin, it is possible to\nroute the wallet’s connection through TOR in order to keep your node IP address\nprivate. This is absolutely needed if you want a secure staking setup (unless\nyou used OpenVPN with solid network rules) as broadcasting the real IP address\nof a staking node to the world is asking for trouble.\n\nDecentralized & Anonymous Person-to-person Marketplace\nQuoted from Particl’s whitepaper draft\n[https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf]\n: “Satoshi Nakamoto, the visionary and creator of Bitcoin, originally intended\nthat Bitcoin is paired with a marketplace, as evidenced by beginnings of a\nmarket framework included in early snapshots of the Bitcoin codebase. The\nmarket-related code was eventually stripped out, however, presumably as he\ndecided to focus first on creating his world-changing currency. The concept of a\ndecentralized marketplace in itself is not novel, there have been a small set of\nacademic constructions and even serious attempts at creating them. They either\npropose solutions that scale extremely well and neglect the privacy\nimplications, or they propose very privacy conscious solutions that do not scale\nwell. Privacy and efficiency are often at odds with each other,” to hide the\nsignal there must be noise”. Tor exemplifies this well, the traffic is pushed\nthrough various nodes with several layers of encryption before arriving at its\ndestination, it is deliberately inefficient but the privacy provided by the\ntrade-off is well worth it”.\n\nParticl Marketplace mock up posted during the fundraiser (Confirmed outdated,\nbut gives a rough idea where the team is going visually speaking)In development\nfor about two years, the Particl marketplace strives to be the first \ndecentralized marketplace to successfully nail scalability and full privacy at\nthe same time. The team aspires to achieve this accomplishment by using the OMP\nmarket protocol they developed internally.\n\nOpen Market Protocol\nThe Open Market Protocol, or OMP, is a “standardized and open format that can\nencompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace” (\nhttps://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/#). The OMP is built with three main\ncomponents in mind, namely extensibility, privacy, and market data portability.\nIt can be adopted by anyone who wishes to build a decentralized market of some\nsort.\n\nIts extensibility characteristic makes it much more resilient to new, more\nefficient technologies to come out. This aspect is explained in details in the\nProtocol-agnosticism section of this presentation.\n\nPrivacy is also an important cornerstone of this protocol. “Recent revelations\nand academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active\nthreats to our digital privacy and security. Additionally, decentralized\nnetworks, as well as blockchains, are open public books full of sensitive\ninformation for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when\ndesigning [the OMP] protocol as it could potentially put [its] users at risk”\n\nPortability is the ability to easily move market data such as inventory, images\nand shipping details (among others) data between different markets. “One of the\nmany frustrations that online merchants and vendors suffer is the lack of\nportability of the inventory data between the many different online\nmarketplaces. The more markets your products are available on, the greater their\nexposure and thus the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet importing the\ninventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process,\noften on purpose to prevent vendors from using competition” By making market\ndata standardized, it becomes very easy for vendors to open a shop on any\nmarketplace using the OMP protocol and realize their full economic potential.\n\nDecentralized & Trust-less Escrow System\nThere are many challenges in designing a fully anonymous and decentralized\nmarketplace. One of these is to ensure that neither the vendors nor the buyers\nget scammed by the other party. How do you make sure the vendor doesn’t simply\ntake the money and not ship the product? How do you make sure the buyer actually\npays for a shipped product? In most cases, typical marketplaces such as Alibaba,\neBay or Amazon use what is called an escrow system. The platform acts as a\nmiddle-man and receives the payment of a product or service on behalf of the\nvendor and holds on to it until the buyer confirms he has received the product.\nShould problems arise, the escrow agent will usually take the role of a mediator\nand decide what happens to the escrowed funds (it will either be a refund for\nthe buyer or a release of funds to the vendor).\n\nSince the Particl marketplace aims to be entirely trustless, it cannot use\nescrow agents as that constitutes centralization. An agent could be wrong on a\ndecision, go rogue, collude with a party, and above all, they always charge a\nfee. No escrow agent will work for free.\n\nThe Particl team developed what they call the MAD escrow system. This trust-less\nand free service is based on the Mutually Assisted Destruction game theory. As\ndefined on Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction],\nMutual assured destruction (or mutual assisted destruction) “is a doctrine of\nmilitary strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of\nnuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete\nannihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It is based on the theory of\ndeterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the\nenemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of\nNash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to\ninitiate a conflict or to disarm”.\n\nIn the context of an escrow system, it simply means that the escrow is designed\nin such a way that it financially punishes both parties if one of them behaves\nbadly. The MAD escrow works by requiring the buyer to deposit twice the amount\nof the desired product in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow address, while the vendor has\nto deposit the full value of the item he is selling as insurance. Both parties\nneed to sign the release of the funds before a set time for the deal to\nconclude, otherwise, the escrow busts and funds are sent over to the stakers.\n\nFor example, if you were selling a 500$ TV to a user, you would have to fund the\nMAD escrow with 500$ and your buyer would need to fund it with 1,000$ (500$ item\nvalue + 100% insurance deposit of 500$). The document section of the\nshadowproject.io website explains in an understandable fashion how the\npsychology behind MAD escrow works:\n\nFrom ShadowProject’s documentation page\n[https://doc.shadowproject.io/#mutual-assured-destruction-mad]: “If the buyer\nreceives the item and decides not to finalize the transaction then the address\nbecomes unspendable after the expiration date and neither party gets their\ninsurance deposit back. The buyer will have effectively paid twice the price but\nthe vendor loses his insurance deposit and the item. [If] the vendor does not to\nship the item, [it] leaves the buyer with the option to finalize the transaction\nor not: finalizing the transaction causes him to minimalize his losses to one\ntime the price of the item and the vendor makes a profit of one time the item\nprice. If the buyer decides not to finalize the transaction he loses twice the\namount of the item price but also causes the vendor to lose his insurance\ndeposit. The buyer is to some extent at a disadvantage and motivated to finalize\nthe transaction to minimize his losses in case of a vendor scam. Both the buyer\nand the vendor will be motivated to extend the escrow transaction and work\ntowards a refund agreement that both parties are willing to sign.”\n\nOf course, this MAD escrow system is flexible. If a problem arises during a\ntransaction, both parties can agree to either extend the escrow deadline time or\nproceed with partial refunds. It is also entirely up to the users to decide what\ninsurance deposit percentage they want to use. A vendor and a buyer could agree\nfor a 25% insurance deposit, meaning that for a 500$ TV purchase, a vendor would\nneed to deposit 125$ into the escrow while the buyer would need to deposit 625$\n(500$ + 25% insurance deposit of 125$).\n\nSelf-Governance\nAnother of the big challenges in designing a decentralized and anonymous market\nis trying to reduce the irresponsible and criminal use of the platform as much\nas possible. Since it is censorship-resistant, no central authority can delete\nits content and so it could easily be abused by criminals, spammers, and trolls.\nThis would end up making the platform look much less appealing to the regular\nhonest user and enable undesirable activities.\n\nParticl’s solution to this problem is a self-governance system where users can\nflag undesirable content. At this moment, it is not confirmed whether a listing\nconsidered undesirable is completely taken out of the market or if it puts it in\nan NSFW kind of state where users can decide whether they want that type of\ncontent to be displayed or not (similar to how OpenBazaar does it). The method\nof governance is also not confirmed, but if we are to speculate, it could\npossibly be tied to staking like Particl’s voting system works (will be\nexplained later in this document).\n\nPrivate Listings\nAs mentioned just above, there is a self-governance in place preventing the\nplatform from essentially becoming a decentralized version of the infamous\nSilkroad marketplace. There is, however, a form of listing which cannot be\nflagged by the community: private listings. These listings do not appear on the\npublic marketplace and are hidden even from the blockchain itself as they are\nfully encrypted. Only a vendor and a user possessing a specific link to the\nlisting can have access to its content, making it a very interesting use-case\nfor alternative markets as anyone could simply run a website making external\nreferences to these private listings, fundamentally creating the perfect\nsemblance of a 100% anonymous and censorship-proof (even from Particl’s\nself-governance system) marketplace that cannot get hacked, be busted or exit\nscam their users.\n\nFighting Spam\nAs mentioned above, spammers are another major concern on popular blockchain\nplatforms. In the crypto world, there are many reasons why one would want to\nmount a spam attack on a chain. It could be because that entity wants to short\nthe coin on trading markets, or because he has invested in a competing platform\nthat is seeking to destroy the reputation of Particl.\n\nFighting spam attacks will always remain an ongoing battle as spammers will\nalways try to find new ways to make themselves an annoyance, and the Particl\nteam plans on keeping the platform spam-free a priority. On market release, the\nplatform will already be armed with two spam-fighting features other than the\nself-governance flagging system.\n\nThe first one of these measures is to make listings stay up for a maximum of 48\nhours. That means a spammer has to constantly keep the attack up otherwise it\nwill not have any long-term damage to the platform. This also helps the market\nbe much more scalable as it only requires to have two days worth of listings.\nThe second measure is the implementation of a very small listing fee (initially\n0.01 PART, can be adjusted and ultimately made dynamic) making a sustained\nattack quite costly for an attacker. While the fees are quite small, mounting a\nconsiderably effective spam attack would require large amounts of funds to be\npaid to the market every two days.\n\nAs will be explained further down this presentation, market fees actually go to\nthe stakers (people who run nodes that secure the network), which brings an\ninteresting dynamic…Any spammer that wants to heavily spam the Particl\nmarketplace inevitably ends up sending his money to the very community he is\ntrying to bring down!\n\nGoing Mainstream\nThe project doesn’t hide the fact that it wishes to become the first\ndecentralized marketplace to become used in the multi-billion “mainstream” world\nof commerce. This is why user-friendliness and usability are at the core of the\nteam’s strategy. The ultimate goal is to make the cryptocurrency side of things\nall in the background so that even your grandmother could intuitively use it.\n\nAnother mainstream-appealing feature the team is working on is the integration\nof many in-client fiat gateways from which one could fund his Particl wallet.\nSome solutions being explored at the moment would allow users to use bank\ntransfers, credit cards, and Localbitcoin-style services. Note, however, that\nneither the Particl developing team nor the Particl Foundation are licensed\nfinancial organizations, therefore this implementation most certainly would be\nthe result of partnerships with other services (i.e. Changelly, Tether, etc.).\nIt would be very surprising if fiat gateways were part of the initial release of\nthe wallet.\n\nLow Fees\nOne great thing about the Particl marketplace is its relatively low prices\ncompared to centralized competitors. In fact, selling on websites such as Amazon\nor Alibaba is great because they bring vendors a lot of users, but they also\ncharge a huge premium just so their user base can be leveraged. After all, it is\ngenerally Amazon/Alibaba/eBay that brings a company new customers, not the other\nway around, so that premium fee is the price to pay to get new customers from\nthese big e-commerce platforms.\n\nLet’s take Alibaba, for example. It is one of the most valued e-commerce\nwebsites on the internet and has a huge user base of both buyers, merchants,\nservice providers and suppliers. If you wanted to start selling products on it,\nyou would probably want to get a gold membership so you don’t get absolutely\nburied in the thousands of listing and so that you at least have a minimum set\nof features you could use. Their gold membership is subscription based and\naccording to Harry Peterson, a professional in China sourcing and B2B\n(business-to-business) marketing, businesses located in mainland China need to\npay almost up to $5,000 USD a year just to get their membership. Businesses\noutside China mainland have variable subscription fees based on which\njurisdiction they are doing business from, but it is estimated that an average\nsubscription amounts to around $2,999 USD a year (\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba). On the Alibaba\nwebsite itself, subscription fees seem to be even higher, now priced at $5,999\nUSD a year for the full package (\nhttp://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html).\n\nOf course, there are various packages and these fees are somewhat flexible, but\nthat gives you an idea what a gold membership costs if you want to use Alibaba\nas a platform and get the whole set of features that will allow you to leverage\nthe full capacity of what the platform has to offer. Don’t forget that on top of\nthese memberships, Alibaba charges a whopping 5% fee on any transactions done\nthrough its escrow system, as it is centralized and requires staff to manage.\nAll these fees, end up being costly for both buyers and sellers. Remember that\nParticl’s MAD (mutually assisted destruction) escrow system is absolutely free\nof charge as it is entirely decentralized and managed by both the buyer and the\nvendor.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, chooses a different fee schedule to make its money by\napplying two types of fees. The first one is a generic “per-item” selling fee.\nYou can choose two plans: the individual plan, which charges $0.99 USD per items\nsold, or a professional plan, which is a subscription of $39,99 USD per month (\nhttps://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm).\n\nOn top of that, it also charges what is called a “referral fee” which is a\npercentage of your item’s value that Amazon keeps for itself. This fee ranges\nfrom 6% to an almost insulting 25% depending on the item’s category. Some\nAmazon-branded items can even go up to 45%. Please visit this detailed article\nto know the exact fee schedule Amazon uses: \nhttp://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/. There is also\nanother type of fee which Amazon can charge, but that only applies if you want\nAmazon to fulfill your order (meaning you send your inventory to Amazon and they\ndo the processing, storage, and shipping for you). These fees are all indicated\nin the CPC strategy article I linked just above.\n\nWhat about eBay? While listing an item isn’t really that expensive, your first\n50 listings of each month being free and the subsequent being $0.30 USD, the\nwebsite still charges you a non-negligible 10% “final value fee” (the final\nvalue is calculated AFTER shipping fees are applied) with a maximum of $750 USD\nper transaction. You can visit this link which details all the listings (plus\nsome advanced feature fees I will not go into): \nhttp://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html\n\nEtsy? Well, it is admittedly much cheaper, but still considerably more expensive\nthan Particl. They charge $0.20 USD per listing posted and then apply a\n“transaction fee” of 3.5% (which isn’t applied to shipping cost as well if you\nare selling either from the USA or Canada but is applied otherwise). There are\nalso various other fees if you wish to use more advanced features such as Etsy’s\n“Direct Checkout”. For their fee schedule, please visit this link here: \nhttps://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/.\n\nAs it is probably obvious by now, these platforms charge their users HUGE\npremiums, which is kind of understandable since they are critical to the success\nof a good number of these vendors. Particl is going to be a much, much cheaper\noption for vendors, regardless if they are big or small. It will also greatly\nbenefit buyers by basically charging them no fees at all except low\ncryptocurrency transaction fees (listing fees are paid for by vendors). Vendors\nwill only need to pay 0.01 PART per listing renewed every two days. This fee is\nlikely to be made dynamic so that it goes down when PART’s price goes up and\nvice versa.\n\nTarget Users\nGoing for the mainstream world of e-commerce certainly is a huge ambition. It is\ntrue that a decentralized system is likely to be less efficient than its\ncentralized counterparts, but it does also offer services that giants like eBay,\nAmazon or Alibaba simply cannot provide to their customers: privacy and\ncensorship-resistance. So who, exactly, would end up using a potentially less\nefficient but more private platform than well-established e-commerce Goliaths?\n\nDuring the time of the initial funding round, I’ve written a lengthy article\n[https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad]\ngoing over exactly this question. Here’s a tl;dr list of potential early users:\n\n- Controversial & potentially illegal goods & services\n- Perceived gray area businesses\n- Unfairly blocked businesses\n- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data & documents\n- Taxation resistance & revolts\n- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not\npresent\n- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts\n- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin\n\nThis article only lists what I could think of at the time, but the potential of\na decentralized marketplace and escrow system is huge and there are some\nuse-cases one could not think of until someone actually comes out with it. A\npotential use case not featured in my previous article which became apparent to\nme since is the use of Particl marketplace’s escrow system for OTC exchange of\nunreleased ICO coin accounts (trading coins before their chain is released).\nThis seems to be an increasingly popular practice within the crypto world, with\nmost vendors/buyers doing these trades on Slack/Reddit.\n\nCurrency-Agnosticism\nBy definition, “an agnostic person is one who believes it is impossible to know\nanything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from\ncommitment to any religious doctrine”. In our context, the platform is\nconsidered “agnostic” because its developing team does not believe its native\ncoin should be created with a “one coin to rule them all” mentality and thus\nshould have a platform that can work with as many cryptocurrencies as possible.\nAs we do not know what coins will be the most used in 5 years, let alone in a\nmonth, it is safe and forward-thinking to make the platform be ready to work\nwith them at any time.\n\nThis feature will mostly be used for the Particl marketplace Dapp, as it will\nallow people to shop online using their favorite cryptocurrency without ever\nleaving the wallet or having to manually trade their coins prior to purchasing a\nproduct. While it may seem like that would reduce Particl’s potential valuation\nas that would generate less demand for its native coin, it actually does not.\nBecause the market’s decentralized escrow is a 2 of 2 multi-sig CT PART address, \nit requires any non-PART purchases to be traded (automatically done by the\nwallet) for PART to operate. Vendors do not even need to state what coins they\nwant to accept, as they all get paid in PART. They are then free to Shapeshift\nback to any coin they want, again without ever leaving the wallet.\n\nThis currency-agnosticism actually brings a lot of value to the platform’s\nnative coin. For one, any order made on the market, whether it is paid using\nPART, BTC, ETH or any compatible currency, ends up being a buy order for PART.\nThis feature also brings a non-speculative use case for all compatible\ncurrencies, as the holders of those coins can now shop online with them and not\nsimply hold them for speculative reasons. This has the potential to end up\nputting a lot of buy pressure on the PART coin.\n\nShapeshift Integration\nThis ability to seamlessly shop with any coin is powered by Shapeshift. That\nmeans that any coin available on their platform can be used to shop on Particl.\nSome of the use cases I personally find interesting is the use of the DGX token\n(gold-backed cryptocurrency, not yet available on Shapeshift though…) and USDt\n(fiat USD-backed cryptocurrency) to seamlessly shop with coins that are backed\nby real assets. Gold bugs will immediately understand why this is a big deal,\nbut let’s pause for a moment and appreciate what opportunity it presents. When\nwas the last time people could just go out and shop using actual gold coins? The\nway it is designed, the vendor does not even have to “accept” the currency on\nhis store, and you can send tiny fractions of that gold coin (which is obviously\nimpossible with physical bullion). This could become a really big use case for\nParticl if the world economy ends up crashing and people abandon fiat for\nvalue-based assets such as gold. This could even initiate a paradigm shift in\nhow people conduct commerce around the world.\n\nNote, however, that this Shapeshift integration is a temporary solution as the\nteam plans on designing its own fully decentralized and trust-less currency\nexchange system. This is due for much later though, and I believe that for the\ntime being Shapeshift will be more than satisfying as an option.\n\nProtocol-Agnosticism\nIn this context, being protocol agnostic refers to the fact that the Particl\nplatform does not limit itself to one decentralized data storage protocol, but\nrather makes it extensible and easy to integrate various different protocols at\nthe same time, and let the user choose which one he prefers using. As Kewde, a\nParticl developer, elegantly puts it on his Open Market Protocol GitBook: \n“Technology moves at an exponential rate, and the very few protocols that\nsurvive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol\nlooking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and\nflexible enough that it easily allows any developer to securely expand it. The\ndevelopment of decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and\nblockchain solutions is still young, there aren’t any clear “winners” that meet\nall criteria nor may there ever be, thus the protocol must accommodate for it”.\n\nTo illustrate why this is a good concept, let’s say Particl only uses its native\nSMSG protocol to run its marketplace on. That would work fine…until the\nmarketplace gets very popular and cannot scale anymore because there are too\nmany people using it. On a protocol-agnostic platform, it would be very easy to\nsimply add a new, more scalable protocol to support the flock of new users, but\nif it wasn’t designed with extensibility in mind, it would be stuck with a\ntechnology that cannot support its own popularity. In most cases, the platform\nwould either be abandoned by its users, require some kind of fork (which is\nrisky), or the developing team would abandon the project and start a new one\nwith better technology.\n\nIn other words, Particl is designed in such a way that it embraces new protocols\ninstead of being rendered obsolete by them, and it does so without ever\nrequiring a fork of some kind.\n\nDecentralized Network Storage\nDecentralized storage networks, or DSNs, are decentralized extensions “plugged”\ninto the Particl protocol to help it store data in a decentralized and off-chain\nfashion. They are what I referred to as “new protocols” in the last section. The\nuse of DSNs is essential as the Particl platform does not store its marketplace\ndata on the blockchain itself as that would quickly bloat it and make everything\nmuch more inefficient. Here is an excerpt from Particl’s whitepaper draft:\n\n“The Data Storage Network (DSN) is tasked with storing market listings as well\nas messages between sender and receiver and all other accompanying data (such as\nbut not limited to images and videos). Sensu stricto the market listing\nreferences, stored in the blockchain, are also protocol-agnostic, simply meaning\nit can handle different DSN protocols such as BitMessage, IPFS, HTTPS…”\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of DSNs that could be integrated into Particl:\n\n- HTTPs (Privacy:- ( — )\n- TOR (Privacy: + + )\n- SMSG (Privacy: + + + )\n- * IPFS (Privacy: + )\n- * Siacoin (Privacy: + )\n- * Storj (Privacy: + )\n- * SafeNetwork (Privacy: + + + )\n\n* This DSN hasn’t been integrated yet or is not production-ready.\n\nAs there isn’t really a “best” solution, the Particl platform lets users choose\nwhich decentralized storage network they want to use. Some DSNs provide great\nanonymity characteristics but don’t scale as well as others (such as is the case\nwith SMSG). Some provide great scaling capabilities but are more expensive to\nuse. There is also the fact that some of these DSNs required a native token\ntransfer (Sia, Storj, SafeNetwork), making the integration trickier (but still\npossible) and possibly less interesting for users. Don’t forget that these DSNs\nwhich use a native token either charge the uploader of content or the downloader\ndepending on what storage network is being used.\n\nWhile DSNs are mostly used by the marketplace application (and the messaging\nsystem in the case of SMSG), the agnostic and extensible design has been\nstandardized by the team so that it can be easily deployed whenever the platform\nneeds to interact with third-party software, once again ensuring that it never\ngets outpaced by new technologies but embraces them instead. It also has the\npotential to add use-cases to other blockchain projects (for example, providing\na complete and decentralized merchant and escrow system to Siacoin).\n\nProof-of-stake Consensus Algorithm\nFrom Wikipedia’s proof-of-stake page\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake], “Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type\nof algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve\ndistributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such\nas bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated\ncryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks\n(i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is\nchosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is\nchosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake)”. Paid at every block, PoS\nbasically financially rewards users for securing the network. It is also much\neasier to start staking than it is to start mining (as you need to buy a lot of\nequipment and do some research to understand how it all works), so it could be\nargued that PoS is a more decentralized and “people-friendly” decentralized\nconsensus algorithm, only requiring users to buy coins, deposit them on their\nwallet and let it open as often as possible.\n\nParticl uses a pretty recent version of PoS named PoSv3, and has a variable\ninflation rate that goes as follow:\n\nYear 1: 5%\nYear 2: 4%\nYear 3: 3%\nYear 4+: 2%\n\nStaking As an Investment\nParticl’s inflation calendar has been designed this way to support the price\nduring the adoption period by making it quite profitable to stake. Once the\nmarketplace application is more popular and as staking rewards reduce over time,\nthe “burden” of price support should organically transfer from speculators to\nmarketplace users.\n\nOne thing that is important to understand about staking rewards is that you are\nguaranteed to get a 5% interest profit in the first year if 100% of the\nnetwork’s coins are staking. Staking becomes increasingly more profitable as\nless and less people stake. This is a direct incentive to get as many nodes\nstaking as possible. However, it is highly unrealistic to think the entire\nnetwork would be staking as evidenced by Shadowcash’s historical statistics; the\npercentage of SDCs staking used to oscillate between 35%-50% of the entire\nnetwork. On Particl, if 50% of the network was to stake their coins, that would\nmean you could expect an estimated 10% yield on your first year (if you let your\nwallet open 24/7).\n\nAnother interesting dynamic resulting from the way PoS was implemented is that\nmarket fees are paid directly to stakers. As explained earlier, the marketplace\nasks for a small 0.01 PART listing fee every 48 hours to fight spam. That means\nthat as the market gets more activity, it becomes even more profitable for\nstakers. If it gets popular enough, it could completely nullify the effect of\nthe decreasing inflation rate on staking rewards and possibly even making them\nbigger in the end. Other fees paid to stakers include regular transaction, CT\nand RingCT fees. Note that as the platform gets more Dapps other than the\nmarketplace, the fees they generate would generally be sent to stakers.\n\nCould there even be more financial incentives to stake? Yes, there is! As\nexplained earlier, MAD escrows have a timer that forces both participating\nparties to release the funds before it runs out. This timer can, of course, be\nextended if both parties agree to, but what if it is not and the escrow runs out\nof time? All the funds are added to the staking rewards, which in some cases\ncould amount to pretty big bonus rewards!\n\nStaking As aParticl Foundation Self-Funding Strategy\nWhen calculating potential staking rewards, it is important to deduct 10% from\nthe final number. Why? The Particl Foundation didn’t want to simply rely on two\nfunding rounds as they have a very long-term vision for the project, so they had\nto find a way to get constant funding. A solution they found was to take 10% of\ndaily staking rewards and use those coins to fund the project (hire devs, launch\nmarketing/PR campaigns, etc.). If you are familiar with the DASH project, they\nwere the first ones to adopt such a strategy and it could be argued that it is\none of the reasons they are doing so well right now.\n\nEconomic Dynamics of Staking\nSince it has been first implemented, proof-of-stake has been observed to propose\na different set of economic dynamics than proof-of-work. The major reason why\nthis is so is that stakers don’t actually need to sell their stakes like miners\nwho need to pay for various expenses (electricity, maintenance, temperature\nmanagement, etc.).\n\nIn fact, if one was to analyze PoS blockchains, he would notice that most\nstaking nodes actually hoard staking rewards rather than cash them out. Since\nthere is no expense tied to staking, it is actually much more beneficial to\nre-invest (stake) your new rewards as that increasingly makes it more profitable\nas time goes by, a concept named compounded interest.\n\n“Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the\ninitial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a\ndeposit or loan. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound\ninterest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a sum grow\nat a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal\namount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of\ncompounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the\ncompound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100\ncompounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5%\nsemi-annually over the same time period.” (\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp)\n\nFor example, at a 5% reward rate, a staker having 1,000 PARTs would end up the\nyear with 1,050 PARTs. On the second year, his 1,050 PARTs would increase by 4%,\nleaving the staker with 1092 PARTs. Another staker decides to sell his stake as\nhe receives them, so on the first year, he would have made 50 PARTs of profits.\nHowever, because he decided to sell his stakes as he receives them, his second\nyear of staking would only yield him 40 PARTs (1,000 * 0.04). Comparing these\ntwo stakers, the first one made a 92 PARTs profits while the second one made 90\nPARTs. Note, however, that this example has been simplified for the sake of this\npresentation. In reality, staking rewards are paid at every block, not every\nyear, so this “build-up” effect that causes stakers to get more PARTs rewards as\nthey re-invest actually happens more quickly, making it even more profitable\nthan in this example.\n\nI’ve made a simple Calc file that allows you to easily calculate your staking\nrewards depending on the number of market listings, the estimated yearly return\nrate, and your PART balance. It takes compounded interest into consideration.\nPlease follow this link to download and play with it: http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\n\nAnother interesting economic dynamic proof-of-stake provides is that it\ngenerates a coin supply shock on trading markets.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this. The first one, as explained above, is that\nstakers demonstrably prefer hoarding over spending their rewards, creating much\nless selling pressure on markets. Generally, this would make the coin’s price\nhigher as the supply is reduced while demand stays unaffected. The second reason\nis directly related to the potential gains a staker can make by simply leaving\nhis computer open. Some people would rather not risk trading their assets, so\ngetting a solid 5–10% investment return under a year can be very appealing,\nmaking the coin more in demand. Taking both these dynamics into consideration,\nit could be said that proof-of-stake increases demand while reducing supply,\nwhich generally makes the coin more valuable.\n\nOne problem with that, though, is that if not enough people want to sell the\ncurrency on the markets (and simply hoard it instead), it can create a kind of\nliquidity crisis where not enough coins are put for sale. This is far from ideal\nfor speculators with large sums of money who wouldn’t want to accumulate coins\non an illiquid market as making a large order could dramatically increase the\ncoin’s price. It is also not a very good marketplace currency as you want to\neasily be able to buy it at a relatively stable price. To understand why simply\nask yourself if it makes sense to have the price increase by 10% just because\nyou made a large PART order to buy a 10,000 USD car on its market. This is not\nsustainable, so what would be the best way to have a healthy and profitable\nbalance between supply and demand?\n\nCurrency-Agnosticism & Proof-of-stake Combo\nI believe Particl already has a working solution implemented to balance its\nstaking dynamics with Shapeshift. Remember how I said the market is\ncurrency-agnostic and uses Shapeshift to seamlessly exchange other coins into\nPARTs? Well, it’s not just the marketplace itself, but the entire Particl\nplatform that is so, making it very easy and tempting to actually diversify your\nportfolio by shape shifting your rewards into other coins. Even though it can be\nhistorically demonstrated that stakers would rather keep their rewards than\nselling them, a proof-of-stake consensus protocol has never been implemented on\na currency-agnostic platform.\n\nEverybody says it: diversification is the key to a profitable and healthy\nportfolio and staying in only one currency is actually pretty risky. What an\neasy Shapeshift withdrawal option provides is the ability to very easily\ndiversify your rewards. That means you could instantly convert PART rewards into\navailable coins, be it BTC, ETH, DGX (100% gold-backed cryptocurrency, likely to\nbe added to Shapeshift soon) or even USDt (USD-backed cryptocurrency). The\nconcept of being able to be rewarded in any currency of your choice is actually\nquite novel and powerful, so it could be reasonably expected that this function\nwill be used a lot.\n\nFor example, I know that I will personally keep around 50% of my own staking\nrewards in PARTs and shapeshift the rest into whatever currency I like at a\ngiven time. I’m surely not the only one who will use the Shapeshift integration\nthis way…This would make the balance between supply and demand more healthy and\nhas the added benefit of making stakers’ portfolios much more secure through\ndiversification. Just pick a couple of coins you like and increase your bags\nevery day!\n\nDecentralized Voting & Chain Governance\nMost cryptocurrencies are designed with full immutability in mind, meaning their\nstate (blockchain data & code) cannot be modified after it is launched (or\nspent, in the case of a transaction). However, recent events in crypto have\nshown us that a fully immutable approach to a blockchain perhaps isn’t optimal.\nIn fact, if you are reading this presentation, chances are that you are aware of\nboth the BTC scalability debate deadlock and the past split of the Ethereum\nchain (ETH & ETC) caused by a contentious hardfork.\n\nIn the first case, Bitcoin requires finding a solution to help it scale better\nin order to allow for more transactions per second. There are two popular\nsolutions to fix scalability, one that requires a change to the coin’s protocol\n(blocksize increase) and one that doesn’t (Segwit implementation). To make\nthings worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the\ncommunity (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners.\nAll these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to\na middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard. Also,\nbecause Segwit only requires miners to signal for it, it could be argued that\nthe actual trading/holding community doesn’t have much weight in this whole\ndebate as they can have only a very minimal impact on the signaling.\n\nIn the second case, Ethereum community was faced with a tough decision last year\nwhen their The DAO smart-contract got hacked and somebody was draining all funds\nfrom it. They had the choice to either let the attacker get away with all the\nfunds, or make a modification to the “The DAO” contract that would have blocked\nthe attack and refunded everyone. The second option, however, required a\nhardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split\n(Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum\nFoundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon\nVote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based\non the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the\nmining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in\ncrypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how\nBitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not).\n\nWe can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing\nwith critical decisions. First, simply relying on miner signaling probably isn’t\nentirely fair to the rest of the community who doesn’t mine. It is true that\nanyone can use his computer to mine on whatever pool they want based on what\ndecision the pool is taking (what is it signaling for), but not anyone has the\nknowledge or gear to do it, and whether this can rival the mining farm’s massive\nhashing rates is arguable. Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it\nalso took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork,\nthere were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of\nit. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted,\nso perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread\nfast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how\nmany coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote. While that\nis not a bad thing in itself, it is relatively easy to game for anyone with deep\npockets. An entity with a lot of money could have bought a large sum of coins,\nput them up for voting, and then dumped them once it’s said and done.\n\nSo with these lessons in mind, the Particl team decided to natively implement a\nvoting system on its blockchain that can be used any time a tough decision needs\nto be taken by any party. Note, however, that this voting system isn’t only used\nto upgrade the protocol, it can be used by anybody for any reason. It could even\nbe a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they\nwant to be added to the store, for example. They knew the system had to have a\ncouple of key characteristics to be optimal, namely being as decentralized,\ncheap and limit abuse/fraud as much as possible. So how did they do it?\n\nThe Particl voting system is based on staking and is absolutely free. People\nwanting to vote on a particular matter need to first select their desired voting\noption and then make their wallet enabled for staking (which has the added\nbenefit of further securing the network). Every time they stake a block, that\nwill count as 1 vote. The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to\nspecify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified\nin terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it\nharder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly.\nThey need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the\nnetwork doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it\nrewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote\non stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet\nintegration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to\nparticipate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting\ncontent (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done\noff-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning. Once IPFS or similar DSNs are\nimplemented, it would then be trivial to also make the voting content in-wallet.\n\nA CLI example of a user voting for option 2 on Proposal #5 from block 124\nto 2,500A staked block’s vote result (a staker voted for option 1 on proposal 10\nat block #167)Particl wallet showing voting results displayed in a GUI widget\nDecentralized & Anonymous Encrypted Messaging System\n“Communication is an essential component of doing business. Modern technology\ngives us cheap, reliable and effortless methods to communicate with others\nregardless of physical distance. However, this technology does little to\nsafeguard the content of our messages from the scrutiny of interested observers.\nWe live in an age of constant and ubiquitous surveillance, where it becomes more\ndifficult by the day to retain our privacy. Privacy is paramount when conducting\nbusiness, the consequences of invasions of privacy can be devastating to both\nbusinesses and individuals, whether the attacker is a rival firm, a malicious\nindividual or an overbearing government”. (\nhttps://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging)\n\nParticl has its own messaging system, SMSG, used as a DSN to host listings on\nand “to perform communication between merchant and buyer.

Nodes must try to decrypt all incoming messages to check if it\nwas destined for them”.\n\nAs explained in the Particl whitepaper draft, “A message traveling on the\nBitMessage network does not include metadata that can reveal who the receiver or\nsender is. Only the encrypted payload, IV, HMAC and temporary public key are\npublic, the receiver of a message is the only able to decrypt the message and\nonly for them the HMAC will properly verify.” (\nhttps://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\n)\n\nWhile there is definitely some area of improvements the team is currently\nworking on, notably concerning dual-key stealth addresses, future and forward\nsecrecy, scalability, blockchain key distribution and RMIDs efficiency, this p2p\nmessaging system offers a safe option for people looking to communicate and host\nmarket listings with the highest level of privacy possible.\n\nNative Segwit Implementation\nAnother sweet feature of the Particl blockchain is that it has a native\nimplementation of Segwit, which I believe is a first in crypto. One small\ninconvenience with blockchain projects forking their chain to add Segwit is that\nwitness blocks aren’t compatible with blocks prior to the fork. While this is\nnot a critical problem, it sure makes things smoother and easier to have a fully\ncompatible Segwit implementation.\n\nHaving segregated witness on Particl gives its blockchain a couple of\ninteresting features. Among many of these, some notable ones are the Lightning\nNetwork, transaction malleability vulnerability fixes, and block capacity/size\nincrease.\n\nLightning Network is a payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon\nand Tadge Dryja and now scheduled for implementation on Bitcoin as well as some\naltcoins. LN gives interesting features to whatever coin decides to implement it\nsuch as reduced transaction fees, increased transaction speed, better privacy,\nand atomic swaps.\n\nAs it is becoming more and more likely as time goes by that the Lightning\nNetwork will be implemented in various different coins, its atomic swap feature\nis getting more relevant. Atomic swapping is the ability of an LN-enabled\nblockchain to be made inter-operable through multi-signature addresses and \ntime-locks with many other LN-enabled blockchains in order to allow trust-less\ncoin exchange between two parties (i.e. Alice can trade 100 LTC to Bob for 1 BTC\nin a 100% decentralized and counterparty-free fashion). This could even be used\nto create decentralized multi-coin payment processors or exchanges, effectively\nspawning a brand new and potentially breakthrough LN-focused ecosystem in which\nParticl could be part of. It also seems plausible that the Particl platform\nwould eventually leverage this feature to allow trust-less currency exchange on\nits marketplace as well as other Dapps, effectively replacing Shapeshift with a\ncheaper and decentralized alternative, even though the team hasn’t made any\nstatement on the matter.\n\nIndustry-leading & User-friendly Graphical Wallet\nAll the aforementioned Particl features wouldn’t be as exciting if they weren’t\nsupported by a user-friendly and eye-appealing wallet. Not everyone wants to use\nterminal-based wallets and even fewer people know how to. Fortunately, the\nParticl team has some of the best graphical designer and UI/UX devs in the\ncrypto scene, as evidenced by their previous work on Shadowcash’s Umbra wallet\nbuilt using HTML5.\n\nGraphical designed of SDC’s Umbra wallet, Particl’s prototype released in 2016\nThis time, the team has taken their GUI work to the next level! Started from\nscratch, the Particl wallet is built using the open-source project Electron (\nhttps://electron.atom.io/) and AngularJS (https://angular.io/) as its main\nframework. The Particl wallet does away with the QtWebKit engine on which is\ncreated all the crypto Qt wallets to make it more secure, beautiful and flexible\n. At this stage of adoption, it is very important for a blockchain project\neyeing the mainstream to have its platform as easy to use as possible. Indeed,\nParticl’s end-game is to make almost everything related to crypto work\nseamlessly in the background while offering users a very intuitive experience\nnot more complicated than using web-based marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay,\netc. A web portal (a website where one could use the Particl marketplace without\neven downloading the wallet and blockchain) is even planned for later, though\nthe team is currently focusing on first releasing the market.\n\nParticl’s “Send” pageSecurity-wise, Electron offers substantial improvements\nover QtWebKit because of how rendered processes are sandboxed leveraging\nChromium’s rendering engine. “A sandbox, in computer security, is a security\nmechanism in which a separate, restricted environment is created and in which\ncertain functions are prohibited” (\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security). In\nParticl’s context, it means that if an attacker was to exploit a vulnerability\nwithin a Chromium rendered process, the damage would severely be limited to this\nvery process and could not spread to other processes due to the engine’s\nsandbox.\n\nOn the aesthetics side, the interface is made much more appealing than the\nfamous Qt engine. Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Angular, it is much more\ninteractive than any crypto wallet currently released and is designed with a\n“modular” approach to it. Indeed, the wallet supports the use of many widgets\nwhich can be selected by the user depending on what information they want to\nquickly be able to glance at. They display much useful information about the\nwallet in a neat visual fashion, and users can very easily customize how their\nwallet looks by adding/removing whatever widget they want. Elements they can\ndisplay include (but are not limited to) staking data, voting data, transaction\nhistory, marketplace data, network data, etc. As they are basically only visual\nrepresentation of blockchain/p2p data, it is very easy to add more of them. It\nwill be interesting to see what the community comes up with in terms of useful\nwidgets they can code and add to Particl. Also, as the project advances in time\nand new Particl Dapps are created, using widgets will lead to very different and\npersonalized experiences from person to person depending on what is their main\nreason to use the Particl wallet (staking investment, shopping, holding,\ngambling on a Particl Dapp, etc.).\n\nParticl wallet widgets overview & responsive capabilityParticl’s “Receive” page\nParticl’s “Settings” pageFor more screenshots of the Particl wallet, you can\neither visit this link of GUI progress screenshots (http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX,\nposted on May 22nd, so may be outdated) or simply go ahead and participate in\ntestnet #4 which is the first iteration of Particl testnet to include a GUI\nversion.\n\nWallet Installer\nAnother useful feature the GUI wallet will have is an installer that\nautomatically pops up the first time a user launches the wallet and offers to\nset up lots of stuff such as wallet file importation, privacy sliders (a user\ncan choose how much privacy he needs to set up DSNs), tor installation, etc.\nAgain, as the project grows, a lot can be added to the installer to make it even\nmore useful and render the experience as user-friendly and customizable as\npossible.\n\nFuture Features\nEven though Particl will already offer quite an impressive set of features on\nday 1, the team has lots of goodies planned for the future.\n\nOne of them is a mobile wallet with ALL desktop features enabled, including\nmessaging and marketplace shopping. The only aspect the team is not sure about\nintegrating into its mobile wallet is staking since it has a couple of drawbacks\n(potentially high number of unstable nodes due to bad phone reception, battery\ndraining, possible security vulnerabilities, etc.).\n\nFiat gateways are also high on the list of priorities. While a solid crypto\nmarketplace could find its niche within the crypto world, it would be much more\ndifficult to go mainstream if it didn’t support integrated fiat deposits and\nwithdrawals. In a way, this is already covered through the Shapeshift\nintegration using Tether (USDt), but more options are always appreciated. The\nteam is considering partnerships with fiat gateways like Changelly which allows\nthe use of credit cards as a funding method or using exchange API keys to\nintegrate fiat pairs into the wallet.\n\nAnother future feature of the project is to establish web portals on which\npeople can access some (or all) functions included in the desktop wallet. The\nend-game here is to allow people to shop on the marketplace using a website and\nwithout having to download the wallet and the entire blockchain. This would make\nit much easier for regular, non-crypto people to use and is one of the things\nthat could greatly help Particl have a shot at becoming mainstream.\n\nThe team is also looking to integrate more DSNs through partnerships (Siacoin,\nSafeNetwork, IPFS, etc.) and others method of network routing such as i2p. This\nis of course with the goal to provide users with a vast array of choices to suit\ntheir security needs and budget (as DSNs can vary in pricing fees).\n\nCompetition\nWith all that being said, it is now time to look at who are Particl’s\ncompetitors. After all, the crypto world is now an extremely competitive space\nand it could lead to several BETA vs VHS or Blu-ray vs HD DVD situations where\nmany projects would compete in the same sector until one becomes big enough to\nstomp its competitors out of business. Hopefully for Particl, it has one huge\nadvantage in the fact that it actually competes in several sectors, dramatically\nincreasing its exposure and chances of success. Please note that the following\nparagraphs will contain a lot of subjective opinions on why I believe Particl is\na serious competitor in many industries, so take it with a grain of salt and\ncome up with your own conclusions.\n\nAs A Currency\nParticl definitely meets the criteria to be considered a competitor in the\npayment currency sector of crypto. Not only does it possess all the same\nfeatures as Bitcoin and other similar currencies, it literally hosts a\ndecentralized marketplace on its wallet on which its native currency is used to\ntrade goods and services. This is a use-case that very few currencies can claim\nto have, but it doesn’t stop there.\n\nParticl also directly competes in the field of privacy coins where Monero, Zcash\n(and similar ZK SNARKS coins) and DASH are furiously battling. Just as in the\npayment currency sector, Particl doesn’t need to shy away here at all. It does\npossess a similar (and arguably better) implementation of Monero’s privacy tech,\nRingCT, and even adds Lightning Network + CT on top of it for a very impressive\nprivacy combo (RingCT + CT + LN combo). This should be very interesting for a\nlot of people and projects that wanted to easily add a RingCT coin to their\nplatform (i.e. Jaxx wallet).\n\nAs A Marketplace\nAnother obvious crypto sector in which Particl is a serious competitor is with\ndecentralized marketplaces. This space has a limited number of competitors such\nas OpenBazaar, Syscoin and Bitify. Personally, as an investor, my subjective\nopinion is that decentralized marketplaces are going to become a big thing in\nthe years to come. This is why I research these projects a lot, and my\nconclusion is that Particl has the most potential to be adopted as a market\nthrough its user-friendliness and the many features detailed throughout this\npresentation. Its two main competitors, OpenBazaar and Syscoin, do have some\ninteresting features but I believe they will not outperform Particl in terms of\nboth popularity and investment returns.\n\nIn the case of OpenBazaar, it is simply not possible to invest in it and while\nit charges no fee, its user experience is years away from any kind of mass\nadoption and has a p2p approach I am not too fond of. It also offers poor\nprivacy and security parameters and should not be relied on by vendors looking\nfor the ultimate privacy experience. What I find to be the most annoying thing\nabout OB is that a vendor needs to host his shop on a computer/server and leave\nit open all the time. Failing that, the listing is put offline and the vendor\ncannot make any sale. It is possible to host your shop on a third-party server\nto make it more reliable in terms of uptime, but that is taking the control out\nof your hands and a security risk as well as going against the decentralization\nprinciple of the crypto world. OpenBazaar plans to launch a second version of\ntheir marketplace using IPFS which would allegedly eliminate the need to have a\ncomputer open at all time, but that does imply that they will need to introduce\na fee structure to their platform.\n\nWith Syscoin, there are other problems that I see. The first one is that the\nuser-experience is simply horrible and the wallet itself is not eye-appealing at\nall. Their solution for this was to create BlockMarket, a more user-friendly but \nclosed-source interface interacting with the Syscoin blockchain. While it is\ndefinitely better looking than its Syscoin backend, it is still years away from\nany kind of mass adoption and its look would most likely turn off anyone that is\nnot involved in crypto. What worries me the most about Blockmarket, however, is\nthat it is basically a glorified centralized marketplace. In fact, The\nBlockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control\nover what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor\nlistings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform\nas it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon\nand eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers,\nmaking it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also,\npurely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl\nbecause people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch\nSyscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter\nautomatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order\nfor a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with\nBitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also\nshould be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the\nproof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of\ngreat features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings.\nLastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very\npopular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data\nare stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on\nDSNs).\n\nThough it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not. I do\nbelieve this kind of industry can and will have enough place for more than one\nmarketplace. After all, we have Etsy, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist and Alibaba all\nco-existing and sharing the same space, but with each one having its niche\nfeatures and appeal to different audiences. There is nothing indicating that\nthis could not be the case in the crypto world as well. Here, Particl definitely\nis the most secure and private solution, and this is what excites me the most as\na privacy enthusiast.\n\nWe should also not forget about centralized, well-established marketplaces such\nas Amazon and eBay. These giants sure do have a huge share of the global market\nand have some really great features decentralized marketplace can probably not\neven dream of offering (at least for now), but they do have negatives that\ndecentralized solutions can do better. Please refer to the previous “Target\nUsers” section of this presentation, or read my previous article on this very\nsubject by following this link: \nhttps://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\n\nI believe that decentralized marketplaces can compete with centralized ones in\nthese aspects:\n\n- Controversial & potentially illegal goods & services\n- Perceived gray area businesses\n- Unfairly blocked businesses\n- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data & documents\n- Taxation resistance & revolts\n- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not\npresent\n- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts\n- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin\n\nAs A Dapp Platform\nEven though the competition with Dapp platforms such as Ethereum, Stratis, Lisk\nor Tezos in not as direct as Particl competition in the marketplace sector, it\nis still a platform on which more “Dapps” than the marketplace will be built. It\nis very important to understand that we are not talking about smart-contract\nDapps here, but rather hard-coded decentralized applications. To give you an\nidea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice\nDapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was\nabandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of\nwhat kind of Dapps Particl could host. The use of DSNs open up a lot of\npossibilities, I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended getting decentralized\nNetflix/Youtube/Music Stores powered by DSNs such as IPFS or Siacoin.\n\nThe main difference with Ethereum in terms of Dapp is that Ethereum is more like\nan operating system similar to Linux where users are given full liberty to code\nany smart-contract with its native programming language (Solidity), whereas\nParticl is more like a WeChat-style application on which apps (not\nsmart-contracts) can be added to. To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer,\nParticl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day\nhave its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized\napplication they want to have on their Particl wallet. It is worth noting that\nParticl Dapps are probably going to be much more scalable than smart-contract\nplatforms as they would work using DSNs (SMSG is not immensely scalable, but\nIPFS, Siacoin or SafeNetwork are).\n\nConclusion & Personal Comments\nFor all the reasons and features mentioned during this presentation, I believe\nParticl is one of the most under-rated and undervalued projects of the crypto\nspace at the moment. Its impressive set of privacy tools, its highly profitable\nstaking reward schedule, and its highly scalable marketplace/Dapp ecosystem\nmakes it extremely likely that Particl will become a popular and widely used\ncrypto-currency in the not-so-distant future. Another thing that I really like\nabout it is that it is building an entire ecosystem rather than being a simple\n“feature coin” (a coin that mostly does ONE thing well). Not only does having a\nworking ecosystem around your coin make it more resilient to being outdated by\nnewer technologies, it also creates a real demand for it rather than just\nderiving its value from trade speculation. This ecosystem is supported by a 5%\n(which will most likely turn into 10%) yearly investment return, on which is\nadded market/Dapps/Txs fees and busted escrow funds.\n\nLet’s crunch some numbers. If one would buy $25,000 worth of PARTs at $25, it\nwould give him a total of 1,000 PARTs. If he were to stake his entire balance,\nhe would be guaranteed 5% yearly, paid every day. The actual more likely number\nwould probably be 8–10%, so let’s round it up to 9%. This staker would make\naround 0.25 PARTs per day (1,000 x 0.09 / 365 = 0.24657), or about $6.16. At the\nend of a full year, considering no PARTs were spent, he would have an estimated\nbalance of around 1090 PARTs, a 9% increase valued at around $2,250 profits. The\nactual formula to estimate staking profits per day is as follow: Balance x\nestimated yearly % returns / 365 x PART price\n\nThat amount, however, is assuming that no transaction happens in the marketplace\nand that no one makes any transaction on the blockchain since no transaction\nfees are added into the formula. To calculate how many additional PARTs one\nwould from the marketplace fees, it is possible to use this formula:\n\n(Estimated number of marketplace listings x 0.01 x 0.5) / 100 x (PART balance x\n100 / Particl total circulating supply)\n\nIf the marketplace was to host 50,000 listings, the staker in the example above\nwould receive an additional 0.3 PART a day, or 11.93 PARTs a year. At $25 per\ncoin, that would earn him additional $298.20 per year for a total of $2,548.20.\n\nAgain, there are some missing numbers that are harder to calculate such as daily\ntransaction fees and busted escrow funds, so it is almost certain that the\nactual staking profits the staker in this example would make in real life would\nbe bigger. It is also not taking into consideration the future Particl Dapps\nthat will end up generating fees as well, making staking rewards even larger. I\nreally do believe these interesting figure could propel Particl into top 10\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nPlease visit this link to download a spreadsheet I’ve made that will help you\ncalculate your staking revenues taking compounding, Particl Foundation donation\nand market fees into consideration: http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\n\nThe only major problem I see with the currency itself is that it could\neventually have scalability problems similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum during\npopular ICOs. Yes, the project will soon get Lightning Network once it is ready,\nbut it is likely that it would be mostly useful for micro-transactions rather\nthan ALL types of transactions. Besides, RingCT transactions cannot be processed\nthrough LN and are certainly NOT lightweight in terms of what space they use\nwithin a block. Even though I have heard from one solid and reliable source that\nthe team does have plans and methods they are exploring that could potentially\nmake its currency scalable similar to DASH’s levels, nothing has been publicly\nrevealed (or even hinted at), so it shouldn’t be taken into consideration until\nthis is publicly discussed. However, if Particl should ever have currency\nscalability problems, it would actually be a pretty good problem as that means\nthe platform would already be quite popular and its coin very valuable. Note\nthat there is a distinction to make between currency scalability and market\nscalability, the latter being already successfully dealt with.\n\nAdditional Resources\n * Particl landing page [https://particl.io/]\n * Particl news [https://particl.news/]\n * Particl’s GitHub [https://github.com/particl/]\n * Whitepaper draft\n   [https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf]\n * Particl Twitter account [https://twitter.com/particlproject]\n * Particl Reddit page [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/]\n * Slack channel invite [http://slack.particl.io/]\n * Riot channel [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org]\n * Latest testnet binaries\n   [https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Particl-Testnet-Getting-Started-d9yhExvCaW6vCp3qLUwuW]\n * Testnet block explorer [http://explorer.testnet.particl.io/insight/]\n * Contact info: hello@particl.io\n\nThis concludes this Particl presentation.

Thank you!</em></p><p>Hey guys,</p><p>I’ve been following an interesting cryptocurrency project for some time and have noticed that very little information was available about it online, so I’ve decided to write a complete in-depth presentation of it. I do believe this project has a lot of potential investment-wise due to its great technology and vision, this is why I wanted to share it with you. This article is going to be quite lengthy, so buckle up.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-is-particl\">What is Particl?</h2><p>To sum it up briefly, Particl is a privacy-focused blockchain/P2P hybrid ecosystem that will host a decentralized and anonymous marketplace as well as an array of Dapps using a native cryptocurrency. The first officially supported Particl Dapp will be a fully decentralized and anonymous marketplace which allows buyers and vendors to securely transact between each other without the need to ever interact with a third-party. It also encompasses a fully anonymous messaging system built similarly to BitMessage. The platform is currency and protocol agnostic (more details on what this means later in the presentation).</p><p>Note, however, that these Dapps are not the same kind of Dapps as on Ethereum. They do NOT work using smart contracts but are instead hard-coded into the client. This makes Dapps much more secure and efficient.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-its-history\">What’s Its History?</h2><p>Particl is the successor of the ShadowProject (<a href=\"https://shadowproject.io/en\">https://shadowproject.io/en</a>), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project started back in August 2014. The team behind this project are known for being innovators in the cryptocurrency scene, being the first to produce many feats such as an HTML5 wallet, a staking mobile wallet with encrypted messaging and transactions, as well as having the first ring signature and HD wallet implementation on BTC codebase. Their Umbra graphical wallet, built using HTML5, is widely known in the “altcoin” community for being absolutely gorgeous and very user-friendly. It was not so long after switching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that this very capable team started working on a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. This has long been seen has the ultimate value proposition of the Shadowcash blockchain.</p><p>Back in late December 2016, word spread around the community that the ShadowProject team had met with major partners in Hong Kong and that big things were coming regarding the way forward. Then, on March 17th, the team announced they were leaving the ShadowProject to start working on a new and more professional project: Particl. This move was encouraged by the fact that the team wanted to have a more professional branding and were looking for funding so that they could work full-time on it and get it going for good. In fact, they had been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms, that the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to associate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the project also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC blockchain/client and team structure. It is for all these reasons the SDC team decided to completely sever the link between Shadowcash and Particl and start the new blockchain from scratch, using their final Umbra release as prototype for the new platform.</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-foundation\">The Particl Foundation</h2><p>The Particl Foundation is a registered Swiss legal entity. As the Particl team was looking to raise money to fund the project, they needed to have a legal body that could receive the funds and spend on behalf of the project. It is also required for most of the logistics of the project (hiring and paying employees, paying hosting fees for the website, etc.) as well as interacting with third-parties (partners, exchanges, gateways, legal &amp; PR firm contracts, etc.). There will be many more details to come once the Foundation is officially registered. It is currently awaiting approval by the Swiss government and it is the last step to be up and running.</p><p>As a funding strategy, the Particl team offered SDC holders an opportunity to swap their SDCs for PARTs at a 1:1 rate, with the possibility for the holder to add an additional amount of BTC to the swap transaction to get a variable PART bonus added to their stash. This extra BTC is what the team collected as funding as SDCs sent into swap transactions were not and will never be sold into the market.</p><p>They have raised 750,000 USD worth of Bitcoin (now worth around 1.4M), and reserved for themselves 513,502 PARTs (6% of total supply) from the total supply. Another 996,000 PARTs are reserved for a second funding round once the MVP of the market is out and released. The funds they raised will be used for salaries, legal expenses for Swiss Foundation creation, initial business consultation expenses, new team members, professional PR, third-party code audits and University grants.</p><p>While it may have been tempting to raise more money, the reasoning behind this crowdfund structure is actually quite sane. The total amount raised is what the team estimated were necessary to run the project for one full year. It is true that other ICOs are raising tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, but in many cases, the development team simply doesn’t need that much money. It could be argued that as these projects raise tons of money, they lose a certain incentive to work hard on their project as they have already cashed out on their idea. In more traditional VC environments, you would very rarely (if ever) see projects raise hundreds of millions of dollars with only ideas, vague whitepaper, and no working products. It is also likely that some of these projects will attract the attention of regulatory bodies due to questionable funding methods.</p><p>The Particl team has mimicked the VC way of initially going through a seed round before going for a larger round of funding. This crowdfund strategy is what was advised by Swiss legal firms which are used to working with blockchain projects. Also, not only does this structure allows for a fair money-raising method, it also incentivizes the Particl team to work hard on their project and deliver a working product that will impress the community. After all, they will want to raise as much money as possible in the second round, and with a maximum of 996,000 PARTs that can be offered, they have all the reasons in the world to make a good product which would bring more value to the Particl coin. When we think about it, this crowdfunds/ICO was pretty fair and exemplary from a legal standpoint.</p><h2 id=\"particl-features\">Particl Features</h2><p><strong>Quick video presentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU</a></p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-blockchain-will-launch-monday-july-17th-2017-at-13-00-utc-3348e8958657\">July 17th 2017, 13:00 UTC</a></p><p><strong>Currency name: </strong>Particl (not to be confused with Particle)</p><p><strong>Currency ticker: </strong>PART (not PRT, which is Particle’s ticker)</p><p><strong>Supported by: </strong>Particl Foundation (Swiss Foundation)</p><p><strong>Total supply:</strong> 8,634,140 PARTs</p><p><strong>Particl Foundation ownership:</strong> 513,502 PARTs (6%)</p><p><strong>First funding round contributors ownership:</strong> 7,124,638 PARTs (82.5%)</p><p><strong>Funds time-locked for 2nd funding round:</strong> 996,000 (11.5%)</p><p><strong>Network consensus:</strong> Proof-of-stake (PoSv3)</p><p><strong>Block time:</strong> 120 sec</p><p><strong>Block size: </strong>~2mb</p><p><strong>Inflation:</strong> 5% year 1, 4% year 2, 3% year 3, 2% year 4+</p><p><strong>Available on: </strong>Windows, OSX, Linux and ARM (Raspberry PI, BeagleBone Black, etc)</p><h2 id=\"bitcoin-codebase\">Bitcoin Codebase</h2><p>Particl is a privacy platform using its own native currency, PART. It is built on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase (0.14.2) on which the dev team <strong>added as much as 100,000 new lines of code</strong> (as of the time of this publication) to turn it into a completely unique coin filled with a ton of cool features. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to ever exist, it is the coin that everyone knows how to work with and also the most battle tested blockchain. For these reasons, it could easily be argued that Bitcoin has the safest codebase on which to build on top of.</p><p>Some other features inherited from the current Bitcoin codebase version include (but is not limited to) <strong>HD wallets, multi-sig addresses</strong> (fully integrated into graphical wallet),<strong> block pruning</strong> (saves quite a lot of disk space after the chain is fully synced),<strong> fast syncing, easy tor setup, watch-only wallet support, libsecp256k1 signing and signature validation, direct headers announcement, notifications through ZMQ, compact block support and ARM builds.</strong> You can read this article to get more information on these features: <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/\">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/</a></p><h2 id=\"dual-token-system\">Dual Token System</h2><p>Why should we have to choose between privacy and convenience when we can have both on the same chain? This is the premise behind one of the major changes the team has made to the Bitcoin codebase: a dual token system. Particl uses two different tokens that can seamlessly be transferred for one another. One of these is a public token, which carries the <strong>same pseudo-anonymity characteristics as Bitcoin</strong>, while the second one is a <strong>completely anonymous and private coin</strong>. Users can easily send public coins into private balances, and the wallet automatically converts the public coin into a private coin. The same can be done if a user sends a private coin into a public address. Sending a private token to a private address successfully “mixes” your coins and allows you to maintain top-of-the-line privacy. Note that it will be very easy and effortless to do these conversions within the GUI wallet.</p><h3 id=\"public-token\">Public Token</h3><p>While Particl is mainly a privacy-focused project, the use of a public token (default token) is very important in terms of management, integration, and security. <br>One of the problems with exclusively anonymous currencies is that it can be hard to confirm the authenticity of the block creation process. What if an attacker had the key to generate an infinite amount of coins? What if no one noticed the hack until the attacker dumps large orders of fraudulently created coins on the trading market? These are very serious threats that are a reality with some of the 100% private coins. ZK SNARKS, for example, a crypto privacy protocol, also has this “hidden inflation problem”. In fact, the chain is initially generated from a set of master keys which could theoretically be used to generate an infinite amount of coins at any time without anyone ever noticing. This is why people say this protocol relies on “trusted setups”; you actually need to trust the party who spawned the chain would successfully destroy the master keys. There is, of course, no way to know for sure whether they didn’t keep copies somewhere or that they were not compromised during any step of the process (software, hardware, network, OS, BIOS, ME chip exploits). After all, cryptocurrencies are now worth a lot and they have become the primary target for hackers around the world.</p><p>It is precisely for these reasons that the Particl team opted for a fully transparent coin generation process. Because all newly generated coins are public, a hacker/bug would instantly be detected and measures could be taken to fix the problem.</p><p>Additionally, since the public token is built in a very similar way as Bitcoin, it is much easier for third-parties such as exchanges, websites, and wallets (Jaxx, Exodus, Ledger Wallet, etc.) to integrate. They do not need to go out of their way and spend many dev hours without knowing if it will be economically worth it to integrate that coin. The best example I could find concerning this, in particular, is the case of Monero and Jaxx. Jaxx is a well-known multi-cryptocurrency wallet and they tried to integrate Monero earlier this year. After trying to add the coin to their wallet, they announced they would finally not do it because it was too complicated and they didn’t feel the amount of dev time required for this project would be worth it. This would not happen with Particl as the BTC codebase is what everybody is used to working with and can integrate it without much effort.</p><p>This public token is also very useful for people who do not necessarily require a permanently anonymous experience. Fully-anonymous currencies can sometimes hinder one’s ability to effectively keep track of financial records and transactions. Some services ask for extra information (i.e. a payment ID for Monero) in order for a transaction to be accepted and there are many situations where one could forget to note that transaction ID down or lose it afterward. There’s also a lot of scenarios where one would need to go back several months into the past to see specific transaction details. In most cases, it is simply harder to keep track of things with fully private coins so having one that does possess great accountability tools is definitively a plus.</p><p>On top of this, a transaction using any privacy coin is generally going to cost more in fees than a public transaction on a non-bloated BTC codebase currency as it typically involves more data movement and computation. A “public user”, one that does not necessarily want to be anonymous, should not have to pay for privacy features he does not need. By making the public token the default coin, this ensures that only users seeking privacy options will use the privacy token, while the public users (which will probably end up being the majority of Particl users if the platform becomes mainstream) default to the public token. This also has the non-negligible effect of putting less stress on the network (as public transactions are more lightweight and do not fill blocks as much as private ones), keeping the network efficient.</p><h3 id=\"private-token\">Private Token</h3><p>Particl’s private token has a variable degree of privacy which can be adjusted by users according to their preferences. In fact, when making a private transaction, it is possible to send it using Confidential Transactions or RingCT (which is a blend of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions). It is noteworthy to mention that <strong>this is the first time both these protocols are being implemented on the Bitcoin codebase</strong>. While a few coins use Confidential Transactions as their privacy protocol, only one uses an implementation of RingCT on their main net: Monero.</p><p>Confidential Transactions, or CT, is a privacy protocol initially developed for Bitcoin that hides amounts sent from the public and makes it visible only to parties involved in the actual transaction. While it is very efficient to obfuscate most regular person-to-person transactions, its most interesting use case is when used in Particl’s marketplace decentralized escrow system. As a matter of fact, if the market’s escrow system worked using the public token, it would be trivial for determined attackers to detect patterns in the public escrow contracts and match them to potential users. On a long enough timeline, users could be identified with particular marketplace orders with a high degree of certainty. With the help of Confidential Transactions, this cuts off this attack vector and makes the escrow system fully anonymous. To learn more about CT, please consult this link: <a href=\"https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt\">https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt</a></p><p>RingCT, on the other side, is an even better privacy protocol combining ring signatures to the aforementioned confidential transaction protocol. Applied on double stealth addresses, not only transaction amounts are hidden but the sender and receiver addresses as well, making RingCT transactions completely untraceable. It should be taken into consideration that RingCT will not be available when Particl first launches, but will it be implemented soon enough. This feature is currently on testnet #3, but it still requires some work before it is incorporated into the main chain. The team also wants to have it fully audited by a third-party before going live with it.</p><p>One useful feature of the Particl wallet is that users are actually presented with the option to choose the privacy protocol they want to use according to their needs. CT is a good privacy protocol for basic privacy, but RingCT is even better as it makes transactions unlinkable. However, the latter is much more expensive in fees than the first one, and people who do not require a “paranoid” level of privacy may not want to pay larger fees.</p><p>In my subjective opinion, Particl will offer the best privacy experience on the market as it is very flexible but makes no compromise. RingCT is considered top-of-the-line technology and it simply works fantastically in preserving one’s privacy. Some could argue that ZK-SNARKS offers a better solution, and that is rightfully debatable. They do offer an interesting privacy solution, but they do have their share of problems and vulnerabilities as mentioned above. Centralized coin mixers are obviously not to be trusted as there is no way to know the legitimacy of the website owner, and coinjoin services are demonstrably weak and exploitable by determined adversaries.</p><p>The hidden inflation problem is also one of the reasons why I believe Particl, with its dual token system, has a “safer” (and easier to integrate) implementation of RingCT than Monero. Don’t get me wrong, there are good arguments people could make about Monero having the better integration. For example, RingCT being mandatory and by default on all transactions makes it impossible to make a basic human mistake (they do happen), but it also makes Monero a more expensive currency to use and a blockchain less likely to be able to support a huge influx of users (as transactions are heavy and would bloat the blockchain faster). This is the kind of debate where both sides have pros and cons, so I will let you make your own conclusion on this topic.</p><p>Also related to Particl’s privacy but not its private coin, it is possible to route the wallet’s connection through TOR in order to keep your node IP address private. This is absolutely needed if you want a secure staking setup (unless you used OpenVPN with solid network rules) as broadcasting the real IP address of a staking node to the world is asking for trouble.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-person-to-person-marketplace\">Decentralized &amp; Anonymous Person-to-person Marketplace</h2><p>Quoted from <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Particl’s whitepaper draft</a>: “<em>Satoshi Nakamoto, the visionary and creator of Bitcoin, originally intended that Bitcoin is paired with a marketplace, as evidenced by beginnings of a market framework included in early snapshots of the Bitcoin codebase. The market-related code was eventually stripped out, however, presumably as he decided to focus first on creating his world-changing currency. The concept of a decentralized marketplace in itself is not novel, there have been a small set of academic constructions and even serious attempts at creating them. They either propose solutions that scale extremely well and neglect the privacy implications, or they propose very privacy conscious solutions that do not scale well. Privacy and efficiency are often at odds with each other,” to hide the signal there must be noise”. Tor exemplifies this well, the traffic is pushed through various nodes with several layers of encryption before arriving at its destination, it is deliberately inefficient but the privacy provided by the</em><br><em>trade-off is well worth it”.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-9M6fKKTzuuy1DhCwp7jtGQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Marketplace mock up posted during the fundraiser (Confirmed outdated, but gives a rough idea where the team is going visually speaking)</figcaption></figure><p>In development for about two years, the Particl marketplace strives to be the <strong>first</strong> decentralized marketplace to <strong>successfully nail scalability and full privacy at the same time</strong>. The team aspires to achieve this accomplishment by using the OMP market protocol they developed internally.</p><h3 id=\"open-market-protocol\">Open Market Protocol</h3><p>The Open Market Protocol, or OMP, is a <em>“standardized and open format that can encompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace” (</em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><em>https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/</em></a><em>#)</em>. The OMP is built with three main components in mind, namely extensibility, privacy, and market data portability. It can be adopted by anyone who wishes to build a decentralized market of some sort.</p><p>Its <em>extensibility</em> characteristic makes it much more resilient to new, more efficient technologies to come out. This aspect is explained in details in the Protocol-agnosticism section of this presentation.</p><p><em>Privacy</em> is also an important cornerstone of this protocol. <em>“Recent revelations and academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active threats to our digital privacy and security. Additionally, decentralized networks, as well as blockchains, are open public books full of sensitive information for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when designing [the OMP] protocol as it could potentially put [its] users at risk”</em></p><p>Portability is the ability to easily move market data such as inventory, images and shipping details (among others) data between different markets. “<em>One of the many frustrations that online merchants and vendors suffer is the lack of portability of the inventory data between the many different online marketplaces. The more markets your products are available on, the greater their exposure and thus the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet importing the inventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process, often on purpose to prevent vendors from using competition” </em>By making market data standardized, it becomes very easy for vendors to open a shop on any marketplace using the OMP protocol and realize their full economic potential.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-trust-less-escrow-system\">Decentralized &amp; Trust-less Escrow System</h3><p>There are many challenges in designing a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. One of these is to ensure that neither the vendors nor the buyers get scammed by the other party. How do you make sure the vendor doesn’t simply take the money and not ship the product? How do you make sure the buyer actually pays for a shipped product? In most cases, typical marketplaces such as Alibaba, eBay or Amazon use what is called an escrow system. The platform acts as a middle-man and receives the payment of a product or service on behalf of the vendor and holds on to it until the buyer confirms he has received the product. Should problems arise, the escrow agent will usually take the role of a mediator and decide what happens to the escrowed funds (it will either be a refund for the buyer or a release of funds to the vendor).</p><p>Since the Particl marketplace aims to be entirely trustless, it cannot use escrow agents as that constitutes centralization. An agent could be wrong on a decision, go rogue, collude with a party, and above all, <strong>they always charge a fee</strong>. No escrow agent will work for free.</p><p>The Particl team developed what they call the MAD escrow system. This trust-less and free service is based on the Mutually Assisted Destruction game theory. As defined on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\">Wikipedia</a>, Mutual assured destruction (or mutual assisted destruction) “is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm”.</p><p>In the context of an escrow system, it simply means that the escrow is designed in such a way that it financially punishes both parties if one of them behaves badly. The MAD escrow works by requiring the buyer to deposit twice the amount of the desired product in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow address, while the vendor has to deposit the full value of the item he is selling as insurance. Both parties need to sign the release of the funds before a set time for the deal to conclude, otherwise, the escrow busts and funds are sent over to the stakers.</p><p>For example, if you were selling a 500$ TV to a user, you would have to fund the MAD escrow with 500$ and your buyer would need to fund it with 1,000$ (500$ item value + 100% insurance deposit of 500$). The document section of the shadowproject.io website explains in an understandable fashion how the psychology behind MAD escrow works:</p><p>From <a href=\"https://doc.shadowproject.io/#mutual-assured-destruction-mad\">ShadowProject’s documentation page</a>: <em>“If the buyer receives the item and decides not to finalize the transaction then the address becomes unspendable after the expiration date and neither party gets their insurance deposit back. The buyer will have effectively paid twice the price but the vendor loses his insurance deposit and the item. [If] the vendor does not to ship the item, [it] leaves the buyer with the option to finalize the transaction or not: finalizing the transaction causes him to minimalize his losses to one time the price of the item and the vendor makes a profit of one time the item price. If the buyer decides not to finalize the transaction he loses twice the amount of the item price but also causes the vendor to lose his insurance deposit. The buyer is to some extent at a disadvantage and motivated to finalize the transaction to minimize his losses in case of a vendor scam. Both the buyer and the vendor will be motivated to extend the escrow transaction and work towards a refund agreement that both parties are willing to sign.”</em></p><p>Of course, this MAD escrow system is flexible. If a problem arises during a transaction, both parties can agree to either extend the escrow deadline time or proceed with partial refunds. It is also entirely up to the users to decide what insurance deposit percentage they want to use. A vendor and a buyer could agree for a 25% insurance deposit, meaning that for a 500$ TV purchase, a vendor would need to deposit 125$ into the escrow while the buyer would need to deposit 625$ (500$ + 25% insurance deposit of 125$).</p><h3 id=\"self-governance\">Self-Governance</h3><p>Another of the big challenges in designing a decentralized and anonymous market is trying to reduce the irresponsible and criminal use of the platform as much as possible. Since it is censorship-resistant, no central authority can delete its content and so it could easily be abused by criminals, spammers, and trolls. This would end up making the platform look much less appealing to the regular honest user and enable undesirable activities.</p><p>Particl’s solution to this problem is a self-governance system where users can flag undesirable content. At this moment, it is not confirmed whether a listing considered undesirable is completely taken out of the market or if it puts it in an NSFW kind of state where users can decide whether they want that type of content to be displayed or not (similar to how OpenBazaar does it). The method of governance is also not confirmed, but if we are to speculate, it could possibly be tied to staking like Particl’s voting system works (will be explained later in this document).</p><h3 id=\"private-listings\">Private Listings</h3><p>As mentioned just above, there is a self-governance in place preventing the platform from essentially becoming a decentralized version of the infamous Silkroad marketplace. There is, however, a form of listing which cannot be flagged by the community: private listings. These listings do not appear on the public marketplace and are hidden even from the blockchain itself as they are fully encrypted. Only a vendor and a user possessing a specific link to the listing can have access to its content, making it a very interesting use-case for alternative markets as anyone could simply run a website making external references to these private listings, fundamentally creating the perfect semblance of a 100% anonymous and censorship-proof (even from Particl’s self-governance system) marketplace that cannot get hacked, be busted or exit scam their users.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>As mentioned above, spammers are another major concern on popular blockchain platforms. In the crypto world, there are many reasons why one would want to mount a spam attack on a chain. It could be because that entity wants to short the coin on trading markets, or because he has invested in a competing platform that is seeking to destroy the reputation of Particl.</p><p>Fighting spam attacks will always remain an ongoing battle as spammers will always try to find new ways to make themselves an annoyance, and the Particl team plans on keeping the platform spam-free a priority. On market release, the platform will already be armed with two spam-fighting features other than the self-governance flagging system.</p><p>The first one of these measures is to make listings stay up for a maximum of 48 hours. That means a spammer has to constantly keep the attack up otherwise it will not have any long-term damage to the platform. This also helps the market be much more scalable as it only requires to have two days worth of listings. The second measure is the implementation of a very small listing fee (initially 0.01 PART, can be adjusted and ultimately made dynamic) making a sustained attack quite costly for an attacker. While the fees are quite small, mounting a considerably effective spam attack would require large amounts of funds to be paid to the market every two days.</p><p>As will be explained further down this presentation, market fees actually go to the stakers (people who run nodes that secure the network), which brings an interesting dynamic…<strong>Any spammer that wants to heavily spam the Particl marketplace inevitably ends up sending his money to the very community he is trying to bring down!</strong></p><h3 id=\"going-mainstream\">Going Mainstream</h3><p>The project doesn’t hide the fact that it wishes to become the first decentralized marketplace to become used in the multi-billion “mainstream” world of commerce. This is why user-friendliness and usability are at the core of the team’s strategy. The ultimate goal is to make the cryptocurrency side of things all in the background so that even your grandmother could intuitively use it.</p><p>Another mainstream-appealing feature the team is working on is the integration of many in-client fiat gateways from which one could fund his Particl wallet. Some solutions being explored at the moment would allow users to use bank transfers, credit cards, and Localbitcoin-style services. Note, however, that neither the Particl developing team nor the Particl Foundation are licensed financial organizations, therefore this implementation most certainly would be the result of partnerships with other services (i.e. Changelly, Tether, etc.). It would be very surprising if fiat gateways were part of the initial release of the wallet.</p><h3 id=\"low-fees\">Low Fees</h3><p>One great thing about the Particl marketplace is its relatively low prices compared to centralized competitors. In fact, selling on websites such as Amazon or Alibaba is great because they bring vendors a lot of users, but they also charge a huge premium just so their user base can be leveraged. After all, it is generally Amazon/Alibaba/eBay that brings a company new customers, not the other way around, so that premium fee is the price to pay to get new customers from these big e-commerce platforms.</p><p>Let’s take Alibaba, for example. It is one of the most valued e-commerce websites on the internet and has a huge user base of both buyers, merchants, service providers and suppliers. If you wanted to start selling products on it, you would probably want to get a gold membership so you don’t get absolutely buried in the thousands of listing and so that you at least have a minimum set of features you could use. Their gold membership is subscription based and according to Harry Peterson, a professional in China sourcing and B2B (business-to-business) marketing, businesses located in mainland China need to pay almost up to $5,000 USD a year just to get their membership. Businesses outside China mainland have variable subscription fees based on which jurisdiction they are doing business from, but it is estimated that an average subscription amounts to around $2,999 USD a year (<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba\">https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba</a>). On the Alibaba website itself, subscription fees seem to be even higher, now priced at $5,999 USD a year for the full package (<a href=\"http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html\">http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html</a>).</p><p>Of course, there are various packages and these fees are somewhat flexible, but that gives you an idea what a gold membership costs if you want to use Alibaba as a platform and get the whole set of features that will allow you to leverage the full capacity of what the platform has to offer. Don’t forget that on top of these memberships, Alibaba charges a whopping 5% fee on any transactions done through its escrow system, as it is centralized and requires staff to manage. All these fees, end up being costly for both buyers and sellers. Remember that Particl’s MAD (mutually assisted destruction) escrow system is absolutely free of charge as it is entirely decentralized and managed by both the buyer and the vendor.</p><p>Amazon, on the other hand, chooses a different fee schedule to make its money by applying two types of fees. The first one is a generic “per-item” selling fee. You can choose two plans: the individual plan, which charges $0.99 USD per items sold, or a professional plan, which is a subscription of $39,99 USD per month (<a href=\"https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm\">https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm</a>).</p><p>On top of that, it also charges what is called a “referral fee” which is a percentage of your item’s value that Amazon keeps for itself. This fee ranges from 6% to an almost insulting 25% depending on the item’s category. Some Amazon-branded items can even go up to 45%. Please visit this detailed article to know the exact fee schedule Amazon uses: <a href=\"http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/\">http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/</a>. There is also another type of fee which Amazon can charge, but that only applies if you want Amazon to fulfill your order (meaning you send your inventory to Amazon and they do the processing, storage, and shipping for you). These fees are all indicated in the CPC strategy article I linked just above.</p><p>What about eBay? While listing an item isn’t really that expensive, your first 50 listings of each month being free and the subsequent being $0.30 USD, the website still charges you a non-negligible 10% “final value fee” (the final value is calculated AFTER shipping fees are applied) with a maximum of $750 USD per transaction. You can visit this link which details all the listings (plus some advanced feature fees I will not go into): <a href=\"http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html\">http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html</a></p><p>Etsy? Well, it is admittedly much cheaper, but still considerably more expensive than Particl. They charge $0.20 USD per listing posted and then apply a “transaction fee” of 3.5% (which isn’t applied to shipping cost as well if you are selling either from the USA or Canada but is applied otherwise). There are also various other fees if you wish to use more advanced features such as Etsy’s “Direct Checkout”. For their fee schedule, please visit this link here: <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/\">https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/</a>.</p><p>As it is probably obvious by now, these platforms charge their users HUGE premiums, which is kind of understandable since they are critical to the success of a good number of these vendors. Particl is going to be a much, much cheaper option for vendors, regardless if they are big or small. It will also greatly benefit buyers by basically charging them no fees at all except low cryptocurrency transaction fees (listing fees are paid for by vendors). Vendors will only need to pay 0.01 PART per listing renewed every two days. This fee is likely to be made dynamic so that it goes down when PART’s price goes up and vice versa.</p><h3 id=\"target-users\">Target Users</h3><p>Going for the mainstream world of e-commerce certainly is a huge ambition. It is true that a decentralized system is likely to be less efficient than its centralized counterparts, but it does also offer services that giants like eBay, Amazon or Alibaba simply cannot provide to their customers: privacy and censorship-resistance. So who, exactly, would end up using a potentially less efficient but more private platform than well-established e-commerce Goliaths?</p><p>During the time of the initial funding round, I’ve <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">written a lengthy article </a>going over exactly this question. Here’s a tl;dr list of potential early users:</p><p>- Controversial &amp; potentially illegal goods &amp; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &amp; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &amp; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><p>This article only lists what I could think of at the time, but the potential of a decentralized marketplace and escrow system is huge and there are some use-cases one could not think of until someone actually comes out with it. A potential use case not featured in my previous article which became apparent to me since is the use of Particl marketplace’s escrow system for OTC exchange of unreleased ICO coin accounts (trading coins before their chain is released). This seems to be an increasingly popular practice within the crypto world, with most vendors/buyers doing these trades on Slack/Reddit.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency-Agnosticism</h3><p>By definition, “an agnostic person is one who believes it is impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine”. In our context, the platform is considered “agnostic” because its developing team does not believe its native coin should be created with a “one coin to rule them all” mentality and thus should have a platform that can work with as many cryptocurrencies as possible. As we do not know what coins will be the most used in 5 years, let alone in a month, it is safe and forward-thinking to make the platform be ready to work with them at any time.</p><p>This feature will mostly be used for the Particl marketplace Dapp, as it will allow people to shop online using their favorite cryptocurrency without ever leaving the wallet or having to manually trade their coins prior to purchasing a product. While it may seem like that would reduce Particl’s potential valuation as that would generate less demand for its native coin, it actually does not. Because the market’s decentralized escrow is a 2 of 2 multi-sig CT PART address,<strong> it requires any non-PART purchases to be traded (automatically done by the wallet) for PART to operate.</strong> Vendors do not even need to state what coins they want to accept, as they all get paid in PART. They are then free to Shapeshift back to any coin they want, again without ever leaving the wallet.</p><p>This currency-agnosticism actually brings a lot of value to the platform’s native coin. For one, any order made on the market, whether it is paid using PART, BTC, ETH or any compatible currency, ends up being a buy order for PART. This feature also brings a non-speculative use case for all compatible currencies, as the holders of those coins can now shop online with them and not simply hold them for speculative reasons. This has the potential to end up putting a lot of buy pressure on the PART coin.</p><h3 id=\"shapeshift-integration\">Shapeshift Integration</h3><p>This ability to seamlessly shop with any coin is powered by Shapeshift. That means that any coin available on their platform can be used to shop on Particl. Some of the use cases I personally find interesting is the use of the DGX token (gold-backed cryptocurrency, not yet available on Shapeshift though…) and USDt (fiat USD-backed cryptocurrency) to seamlessly shop with coins that are backed by real assets. Gold bugs will immediately understand why this is a big deal, but let’s pause for a moment and appreciate what opportunity it presents. When was the last time people could just go out and shop using actual gold coins? The way it is designed, the vendor does not even have to “accept” the currency on his store, and you can send tiny fractions of that gold coin (which is obviously impossible with physical bullion). This could become a really big use case for Particl if the world economy ends up crashing and people abandon fiat for value-based assets such as gold. This could even initiate a paradigm shift in how people conduct commerce around the world.</p><p>Note, however, that this Shapeshift integration is a temporary solution as the team plans on designing its own fully decentralized and trust-less currency exchange system. This is due for much later though, and I believe that for the time being Shapeshift will be more than satisfying as an option.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol-Agnosticism</h3><p>In this context, being protocol agnostic refers to the fact that the Particl platform does not limit itself to one decentralized data storage protocol, but rather makes it extensible and easy to <strong>integrate various different protocols at the same time, and let the user choose which one he prefers using</strong>. As Kewde, a Particl developer, elegantly puts it on his Open Market Protocol GitBook: <em>“Technology moves at an exponential rate, and the very few protocols that survive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol looking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and flexible enough that it easily allows any developer to securely expand it. The development of decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and blockchain solutions is still young, there aren’t any clear “winners” that meet all criteria nor may there ever be, thus the protocol must accommodate for it”.</em></p><p>To illustrate why this is a good concept, let’s say Particl only uses its native SMSG protocol to run its marketplace on. That would work fine…until the marketplace gets very popular and cannot scale anymore because there are too many people using it. On a protocol-agnostic platform, it would be very easy to simply add a new, more scalable protocol to support the flock of new users, but if it wasn’t designed with extensibility in mind, it would be stuck with a technology that cannot support its own popularity. In most cases, the platform would either be abandoned by its users, require some kind of fork (which is risky), or the developing team would abandon the project and start a new one with better technology.</p><p>In other words, <strong>Particl is designed in such a way that it embraces new protocols instead of being rendered obsolete by them</strong>, and it does so without ever requiring a fork of some kind.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-network-storage\">Decentralized Network Storage</h3><p>Decentralized storage networks, or DSNs, are decentralized extensions “plugged” into the Particl protocol to help it store data in a decentralized and off-chain fashion. They are what I referred to as “new protocols” in the last section. The use of DSNs is essential as the Particl platform does not store its marketplace data on the blockchain itself as that would quickly bloat it and make everything much more inefficient. Here is an excerpt from Particl’s whitepaper draft: <br> <br> <em>“The Data Storage Network (DSN) is tasked with storing market listings as well as messages between sender and receiver and all other accompanying data (such as but not limited to images and videos). Sensu stricto the market listing references, stored in the blockchain, are also protocol-agnostic, simply meaning it can handle different DSN protocols such as BitMessage, IPFS, HTTPS…”</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-FuY-KpehaQSXH8Bf7634_Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of DSNs that could be integrated into Particl:</p><p>- HTTPs (Privacy:- ( — )<br>- TOR (Privacy: + + )<br>- SMSG (Privacy: + + + )<br>- * IPFS (Privacy: + )<br>- * Siacoin (Privacy: + )<br>- * Storj (Privacy: + )<br>- * SafeNetwork (Privacy: + + + )</p><p>* This DSN hasn’t been integrated yet or is not production-ready.</p><p>As there isn’t really a “best” solution, the Particl platform lets users choose which decentralized storage network they want to use. Some DSNs provide great anonymity characteristics but don’t scale as well as others (such as is the case with SMSG). Some provide great scaling capabilities but are more expensive to use. There is also the fact that some of these DSNs required a native token transfer (Sia, Storj, SafeNetwork), making the integration trickier (but still possible) and possibly less interesting for users. Don’t forget that these DSNs which use a native token either charge the uploader of content or the downloader depending on what storage network is being used.</p><p>While DSNs are mostly used by the marketplace application (and the messaging system in the case of SMSG), the agnostic and extensible design has been standardized by the team so that it can be easily deployed whenever the platform needs to interact with third-party software, once again ensuring that it never gets outpaced by new technologies but embraces them instead. It also has the potential to add use-cases to other blockchain projects (for example, providing a complete and decentralized merchant and escrow system to Siacoin).</p><h2 id=\"proof-of-stake-consensus-algorithm\">Proof-of-stake Consensus Algorithm</h2><p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake\">Wikipedia’s proof-of-stake page</a>,<em> “Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake)”.</em> Paid at every block, PoS basically financially rewards users for securing the network. It is also much easier to start staking than it is to start mining (as you need to buy a lot of equipment and do some research to understand how it all works), so it could be argued that PoS is a more decentralized and “people-friendly” decentralized consensus algorithm, only requiring users to buy coins, deposit them on their wallet and let it open as often as possible.</p><p>Particl uses a pretty recent version of PoS named PoSv3, and has a variable inflation rate that goes as follow:</p><p>Year 1: 5%<br>Year 2: 4% <br>Year 3: 3%<br>Year 4+: 2%</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-an-investment\">Staking As an Investment</h3><p>Particl’s inflation calendar has been designed this way to support the price during the adoption period by making it quite profitable to stake. Once the marketplace application is more popular and as staking rewards reduce over time, the “burden” of price support should organically transfer from speculators to marketplace users.</p><p>One thing that is important to understand about staking rewards is that you are guaranteed to get a 5% interest profit in the first year <strong>if 100% of the network’s coins are staking. </strong>Staking becomes increasingly more profitable as less and less people stake. This is a direct incentive to get as many nodes staking as possible. However, it is highly unrealistic to think the entire network would be staking as evidenced by Shadowcash’s historical statistics; the percentage of SDCs staking used to oscillate between 35%-50% of the entire network. On Particl, if 50% of the network was to stake their coins, that would mean you could expect an estimated 10% yield on your first year (if you let your wallet open 24/7).</p><p>Another interesting dynamic resulting from the way PoS was implemented is that market fees are paid directly to stakers. As explained earlier, the marketplace asks for a small 0.01 PART listing fee every 48 hours to fight spam. That means that as the market gets more activity, <strong>it becomes even more profitable</strong> for stakers. If it gets popular enough, it could completely nullify the effect of the decreasing inflation rate on staking rewards and possibly even making them bigger in the end. Other fees paid to stakers include regular transaction, CT and RingCT fees. Note that as the platform gets more Dapps other than the marketplace, the fees they generate would generally be sent to stakers.</p><p>Could there even be more financial incentives to stake? Yes, there is! As explained earlier, MAD escrows have a timer that forces both participating parties to release the funds before it runs out. This timer can, of course, be extended if both parties agree to, but what if it is not and the escrow runs out of time? All the funds are added to the staking rewards, which in some cases could amount to pretty big bonus rewards!</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-aparticl-foundation-self-funding-strategy\">Staking As aParticl Foundation Self-Funding Strategy</h3><p>When calculating potential staking rewards, it is important to deduct 10% from the final number. Why? The Particl Foundation didn’t want to simply rely on two funding rounds as they have a very long-term vision for the project, so they had to find a way to get constant funding. A solution they found was to take 10% of daily staking rewards and use those coins to fund the project (hire devs, launch marketing/PR campaigns, etc.). If you are familiar with the DASH project, they were the first ones to adopt such a strategy and it could be argued that it is one of the reasons they are doing so well right now.</p><h3 id=\"economic-dynamics-of-staking\">Economic Dynamics of Staking</h3><p>Since it has been first implemented, proof-of-stake has been observed to propose a different set of economic dynamics than proof-of-work. The major reason why this is so is that stakers don’t actually need to sell their stakes like miners who need to pay for various expenses (electricity, maintenance, temperature management, etc.).</p><p>In fact, if one was to analyze PoS blockchains, he would notice that most staking nodes actually hoard staking rewards rather than cash them out. Since there is no expense tied to staking, it is actually much more beneficial to re-invest (stake) your new rewards as that increasingly makes it more profitable as time goes by, a concept named compounded interest.</p><p>“Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of compounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100 compounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5% semi-annually over the same time period.” (<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp</a>)</p><p>For example, at a 5% reward rate, a staker having 1,000 PARTs would end up the year with 1,050 PARTs. On the second year, his 1,050 PARTs would increase by 4%, leaving the staker with 1092 PARTs. Another staker decides to sell his stake as he receives them, so on the first year, he would have made 50 PARTs of profits. However, because he decided to sell his stakes as he receives them, his second year of staking would only yield him 40 PARTs (1,000 * 0.04). Comparing these two stakers, the first one made a 92 PARTs profits while the second one made 90 PARTs. Note, however, that this example has been simplified for the sake of this presentation. In reality, staking rewards are paid at every block, not every year, so this “build-up” effect that causes stakers to get more PARTs rewards as they re-invest actually happens more quickly, making it even more profitable than in this example.</p><p>I’ve made a simple Calc file that allows you to easily calculate your staking rewards depending on the number of market listings, the estimated yearly return rate, and your PART balance. It takes compounded interest into consideration. Please follow this link to download and play with it: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>Another interesting economic dynamic proof-of-stake provides is that it generates a coin supply shock on trading markets.</p><p>There are two main reasons for this. The first one, as explained above, is that stakers demonstrably prefer hoarding over spending their rewards, creating much less selling pressure on markets. Generally, this would make the coin’s price higher as the supply is reduced while demand stays unaffected. The second reason is directly related to the potential gains a staker can make by simply leaving his computer open. Some people would rather not risk trading their assets, so getting a solid 5–10% investment return under a year can be very appealing, making the coin more in demand. Taking both these dynamics into consideration, it could be said that proof-of-stake increases demand while reducing supply, which generally makes the coin more valuable.</p><p>One problem with that, though, is that if not enough people want to sell the currency on the markets (and simply hoard it instead), it can create a kind of liquidity crisis where not enough coins are put for sale. This is far from ideal for speculators with large sums of money who wouldn’t want to <strong>accumulate</strong> coins on an illiquid market as making a large order could dramatically increase the coin’s price. It is also not a very good marketplace currency as you want to easily be able to buy it at a relatively stable price. To understand why simply ask yourself if it makes sense to have the price increase by 10% just because you made a large PART order to buy a 10,000 USD car on its market. This is not sustainable, so what would be the best way to have a healthy and profitable balance between supply and demand?</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism-proof-of-stake-combo\">Currency-Agnosticism &amp; Proof-of-stake Combo</h3><p>I believe Particl already has a working solution implemented to balance its staking dynamics with Shapeshift. Remember how I said the market is currency-agnostic and uses Shapeshift to seamlessly exchange other coins into PARTs? Well, it’s not just the marketplace itself, but the entire Particl platform that is so, making it very easy and tempting to actually diversify your portfolio by shape shifting your rewards into other coins. Even though it can be historically demonstrated that stakers would rather keep their rewards than selling them, a proof-of-stake consensus protocol has never been implemented on a currency-agnostic platform.</p><p>Everybody says it: diversification is the key to a profitable and healthy portfolio and staying in only one currency is actually pretty risky. What an easy Shapeshift withdrawal option provides is the ability to very easily diversify your rewards. That means you could instantly convert PART rewards into available coins, be it BTC, ETH, DGX (100% gold-backed cryptocurrency, likely to be added to Shapeshift soon) or even USDt (USD-backed cryptocurrency). The concept of being able to be rewarded in any currency of your choice is actually quite novel and powerful, so it could be reasonably expected that this function will be used a lot.</p><p>For example, I know that I will personally keep around 50% of my own staking rewards in PARTs and shapeshift the rest into whatever currency I like at a given time. I’m surely not the only one who will use the Shapeshift integration this way…This would make the balance between supply and demand more healthy and has the added benefit of making stakers’ portfolios much more secure through diversification. Just pick a couple of coins you like and increase your bags every day!</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-voting-chain-governance\">Decentralized Voting &amp; Chain Governance</h3><p>Most cryptocurrencies are designed with full immutability in mind, meaning their state (blockchain data &amp; code) cannot be modified after it is launched (or spent, in the case of a transaction). However, recent events in crypto have shown us that a fully immutable approach to a blockchain perhaps isn’t optimal. In fact, if you are reading this presentation, chances are that you are aware of both the BTC <strong>scalability debate deadlock</strong> and the past split of the Ethereum chain (ETH &amp; ETC) caused by a <strong>contentious hardfork.</strong></p><p>In the first case, Bitcoin requires finding a solution to help it scale better in order to allow for more transactions per second. There are two popular solutions to fix scalability, one that requires a change to the coin’s protocol (blocksize increase) and one that doesn’t (Segwit implementation). To make things worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the community (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners. All these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to a middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard. Also, because Segwit only requires miners to signal for it, it could be argued that the actual trading/holding community doesn’t have much weight in this whole debate as they can have only a very minimal impact on the signaling.</p><p>In the second case, Ethereum community was faced with a tough decision last year when their The DAO smart-contract got hacked and somebody was draining all funds from it. They had the choice to either let the attacker get away with all the funds, or make a modification to the “The DAO” contract that would have blocked the attack and refunded everyone. The second option, however, required a hardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum Foundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon Vote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based on the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the mining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in crypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how Bitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not).</p><p>We can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing with critical decisions. First, simply relying on miner signaling probably isn’t entirely fair to the rest of the community who doesn’t mine. It is true that anyone can use his computer to mine on whatever pool they want based on what decision the pool is taking (what is it signaling for), but not anyone has the knowledge or gear to do it, and whether this can rival the mining farm’s massive hashing rates is arguable. Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it also took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork, there were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of it. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted, so perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread fast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how many coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote. While that is not a bad thing in itself, it is relatively easy to game for anyone with deep pockets. An entity with a lot of money could have bought a large sum of coins, put them up for voting, and then dumped them once it’s said and done.</p><p>So with these lessons in mind, the Particl team decided to natively implement a voting system on its blockchain that can be used any time a tough decision needs to be taken by any party. Note, however, that this voting system isn’t only used to upgrade the protocol, it can be used by anybody for any reason. It could even be a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they want to be added to the store, for example. They knew the system had to have a couple of key characteristics to be optimal, namely being as decentralized, cheap and limit abuse/fraud as much as possible. So how did they do it?</p><p>The Particl voting system is based on staking and is absolutely free. People wanting to vote on a particular matter need to first select their desired voting option and then make their wallet enabled for staking (which has the added benefit of further securing the network). Every time they stake a block, that will count as 1 vote. The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to specify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified in terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it harder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly. They need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the network doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it rewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote on stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet integration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to participate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting content (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done off-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning. Once IPFS or similar DSNs are implemented, it would then be trivial to also make the voting content in-wallet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-BMvbHi93DbicQue6FOuGDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A CLI example of a user voting for option 2 on Proposal #5 from block 124 to 2,500</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-MRGH2pEBnZyaDl-CPbWGZA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A staked block’s vote result (a staker voted for option 1 on proposal 10 at block #167)</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-6DVsuZ-OQtnA6M5E6YwdHg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl wallet showing voting results displayed in a GUI widget</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-encrypted-messaging-system\">Decentralized &amp; Anonymous Encrypted Messaging System</h2><p>“<em>Communication is an essential component of doing business. Modern technology gives us cheap, reliable and effortless methods to communicate with others regardless of physical distance. However, this technology does little to safeguard the content of our messages from the scrutiny of interested observers. We live in an age of constant and ubiquitous surveillance, where it becomes more difficult by the day to retain our privacy. Privacy is paramount when conducting business, the consequences of invasions of privacy can be devastating to both businesses and individuals, whether the attacker is a rival firm, a malicious individual or an overbearing government”. (</em><a href=\"https://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging\"><em>https://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>Particl has its own messaging system, SMSG, used as a DSN to host listings on and <em>“to perform communication between merchant and buyer. All nodes participating in the network store all messages of the past 48 hours, this means anyone in the network could have been the sender or receiver. The benefit of the decentralized topology is that there are no direct ties between the messages and any IP addresses. Nodes must try to decrypt all incoming messages to check if it was destined for them”.</em></p><p>As explained in the Particl whitepaper draft, <em>“A message traveling on the BitMessage network does not include metadata that can reveal who the receiver or sender is. Only the encrypted payload, IV, HMAC and temporary public key are public, the receiver of a message is the only able to decrypt the message and only for them the HMAC will properly verify.” </em>(<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf</a>)</p><p>While there is definitely some area of improvements the team is currently working on, notably concerning dual-key stealth addresses, future and forward secrecy, scalability, blockchain key distribution and RMIDs efficiency, this p2p messaging system offers a safe option for people looking to communicate and host market listings with the highest level of privacy possible.</p><h3 id=\"native-segwit-implementation\">Native Segwit Implementation</h3><p>Another sweet feature of the Particl blockchain is that it has a native implementation of Segwit, which I believe is a first in crypto. One small inconvenience with blockchain projects forking their chain to add Segwit is that witness blocks aren’t compatible with blocks prior to the fork. While this is not a critical problem, it sure makes things smoother and easier to have a fully compatible Segwit implementation.</p><p>Having segregated witness on Particl gives its blockchain a couple of interesting features. Among many of these, some notable ones are the <strong>Lightning Network</strong>, <strong>transaction malleability vulnerability fixes</strong>, and <strong>block capacity/size increase</strong>.<br> <br> Lightning Network is a payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja and now scheduled for implementation on Bitcoin as well as some altcoins. LN gives interesting features to whatever coin decides to implement it such as <strong>reduced transaction fees</strong>, <strong>increased transaction speed</strong>, better privacy, and <strong>atomic swaps.</strong></p><p>As it is becoming more and more likely as time goes by that the Lightning Network will be implemented in various different coins, its atomic swap feature is getting more relevant. Atomic swapping is the ability of an LN-enabled blockchain to be made inter-operable through <strong>multi-signature addresses</strong> and <strong>time-locks</strong> with many other LN-enabled blockchains in order to allow trust-less coin exchange between two parties (i.e. Alice can trade 100 LTC to Bob for 1 BTC in a 100% decentralized and counterparty-free fashion). This could even be used to create decentralized multi-coin payment processors or exchanges, effectively spawning a brand new and potentially breakthrough <strong>LN-focused ecosystem</strong> in which Particl could be part of. It also seems plausible that the Particl platform would eventually leverage this feature to allow trust-less currency exchange on its marketplace as well as other Dapps, effectively replacing Shapeshift with a cheaper and decentralized alternative, even though the team hasn’t made any statement on the matter.</p><h2 id=\"industry-leading-user-friendly-graphical-wallet\">Industry-leading &amp; User-friendly Graphical Wallet</h2><p>All the aforementioned Particl features wouldn’t be as exciting if they weren’t supported by a user-friendly and eye-appealing wallet. Not everyone wants to use terminal-based wallets and even fewer people know how to. Fortunately, the Particl team has some of the best graphical designer and UI/UX devs in the crypto scene, as evidenced by their previous work on Shadowcash’s Umbra wallet built using HTML5.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-KttFKS_tel6YuhGReMv9kw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Graphical designed of SDC’s Umbra wallet, Particl’s prototype released in 2016</figcaption></figure><p>This time, the team has taken their GUI work to the next level! Started from scratch, the Particl wallet is built using the open-source project Electron (<a href=\"https://electron.atom.io/\">https://electron.atom.io/</a>) and AngularJS (<a href=\"https://angular.io/\">https://angular.io/</a>) as its main framework. The Particl wallet does away with the QtWebKit engine on which is created all the crypto Qt wallets to make it more <strong>secure, beautiful and flexible</strong>. At this stage of adoption, it is very important for a blockchain project eyeing the mainstream to have its platform as easy to use as possible. Indeed, Particl’s end-game is to make almost everything related to crypto work seamlessly in the background while offering users a very intuitive experience not more complicated than using web-based marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, etc. A web portal (a website where one could use the Particl marketplace without even downloading the wallet and blockchain) is even planned for later, though the team is currently focusing on first releasing the market.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-D-85sM7GwLoHE2gNLuhoDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s “Send” page</figcaption></figure><p>Security-wise, Electron offers substantial improvements over QtWebKit because of how rendered processes are sandboxed leveraging Chromium’s rendering engine. “A sandbox, in computer security, is a security mechanism in which a separate, restricted environment is created and in which certain functions are prohibited” (<a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security\">https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security</a>). In Particl’s context, it means that if an attacker was to exploit a vulnerability within a Chromium rendered process, the damage would severely be limited to this very process and could not spread to other processes due to the engine’s sandbox.</p><p>On the aesthetics side, the interface is made much more appealing than the famous Qt engine. Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Angular, it is much more interactive than any crypto wallet currently released and is designed with a “modular” approach to it. Indeed, the wallet supports the use of many widgets which can be selected by the user depending on what information they want to quickly be able to glance at. They display much useful information about the wallet in a neat visual fashion, and users can very easily customize how their wallet looks by adding/removing whatever widget they want. Elements they can display include (but are not limited to) staking data, voting data, transaction history, marketplace data, network data, etc. As they are basically only visual representation of blockchain/p2p data, it is very easy to add more of them. It will be interesting to see what the community comes up with in terms of useful widgets they can code and add to Particl. Also, as the project advances in time and new Particl Dapps are created, using widgets will lead to very different and personalized experiences from person to person depending on what is their main reason to use the Particl wallet (staking investment, shopping, holding, gambling on a Particl Dapp, etc.).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-DQmkHEn_IU0S5ymg4P1oug.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl wallet widgets overview & responsive capability</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-ukw96KJfPVy6VXrF6Yxuww.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s “Receive” page</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-git6mMXlfrz_Lb-dEi2Sgg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s “Settings” page</figcaption></figure><p>For more screenshots of the Particl wallet, you can either visit this link of GUI progress screenshots (<a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX\">http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX</a>, posted on May 22nd, so may be outdated) or simply go ahead and participate in testnet #4 which is the first iteration of Particl testnet to include a GUI version.</p><h3 id=\"wallet-installer\">Wallet Installer</h3><p>Another useful feature the GUI wallet will have is an installer that automatically pops up the first time a user launches the wallet and offers to set up lots of stuff such as wallet file importation, privacy sliders (a user can choose how much privacy he needs to set up DSNs), tor installation, etc. Again, as the project grows, a lot can be added to the installer to make it even more useful and render the experience as user-friendly and customizable as possible.</p><h2 id=\"future-features\">Future Features</h2><p>Even though Particl will already offer quite an impressive set of features on day 1, the team has lots of goodies planned for the future.</p><p>One of them is a mobile wallet with ALL desktop features enabled, including messaging and marketplace shopping. The only aspect the team is not sure about integrating into its mobile wallet is staking since it has a couple of drawbacks (potentially high number of unstable nodes due to bad phone reception, battery draining, possible security vulnerabilities, etc.).</p><p>Fiat gateways are also high on the list of priorities. While a solid crypto marketplace could find its niche within the crypto world, it would be much more difficult to go mainstream if it didn’t support integrated fiat deposits and withdrawals. In a way, this is already covered through the Shapeshift integration using Tether (USDt), but more options are always appreciated. The team is considering partnerships with fiat gateways like Changelly which allows the use of credit cards as a funding method or using exchange API keys to integrate fiat pairs into the wallet.</p><p>Another future feature of the project is to establish web portals on which people can access some (or all) functions included in the desktop wallet. The end-game here is to allow people to shop on the marketplace using a website and without having to download the wallet and the entire blockchain. This would make it much easier for regular, non-crypto people to use and is one of the things that could greatly help Particl have a shot at becoming mainstream.</p><p>The team is also looking to integrate more DSNs through partnerships (Siacoin, SafeNetwork, IPFS, etc.) and others method of network routing such as i2p. This is of course with the goal to provide users with a vast array of choices to suit their security needs and budget (as DSNs can vary in pricing fees).</p><h2 id=\"competition\">Competition</h2><p>With all that being said, it is now time to look at who are Particl’s competitors. After all, the crypto world is now an extremely competitive space and it could lead to several BETA vs VHS or Blu-ray vs HD DVD situations where many projects would compete in the same sector until one becomes big enough to stomp its competitors out of business. Hopefully for Particl, it has one huge advantage in the fact that it actually competes in several sectors, dramatically increasing its exposure and chances of success. Please note that the following paragraphs will contain a lot of subjective opinions on why I believe Particl is a serious competitor in many industries, so take it with a grain of salt and come up with your own conclusions.</p><h3 id=\"as-a-currency\">As A Currency</h3><p>Particl definitely meets the criteria to be considered a competitor in the payment currency sector of crypto. Not only does it possess all the same features as Bitcoin and other similar currencies, it literally hosts a decentralized marketplace on its wallet on which its native currency is used to trade goods and services. This is a use-case that very few currencies can claim to have, but it doesn’t stop there.</p><p>Particl also directly competes in the field of privacy coins where Monero, Zcash (and similar ZK SNARKS coins) and DASH are furiously battling. Just as in the payment currency sector, Particl doesn’t need to shy away here at all. It does possess a similar (and <strong>arguably</strong> better) implementation of Monero’s privacy tech, RingCT, and even adds Lightning Network + CT on top of it for a very impressive privacy combo (<strong>RingCT + CT + LN combo</strong>). This should be very interesting for a lot of people and projects that wanted to easily add a RingCT coin to their platform (i.e. Jaxx wallet).</p><h3 id=\"as-a-marketplace\">As A Marketplace</h3><p>Another obvious crypto sector in which Particl is a serious competitor is with decentralized marketplaces. This space has a limited number of competitors such as OpenBazaar, Syscoin and Bitify. Personally, as an investor, my subjective opinion is that decentralized marketplaces are going to become a big thing in the years to come. This is why I research these projects a lot, and my conclusion is that Particl has the most potential to be adopted as a market through its user-friendliness and the many features detailed throughout this presentation. Its two main competitors, OpenBazaar and Syscoin, do have some interesting features but I believe they will not outperform Particl in terms of both popularity and investment returns. <br> <br> In the case of OpenBazaar, it is simply not possible to invest in it and while it charges no fee, its user experience is years away from any kind of mass adoption and has a p2p approach I am not too fond of. It also offers poor privacy and security parameters and should not be relied on by vendors looking for the ultimate privacy experience. What I find to be the most annoying thing about OB is that a vendor needs to host his shop on a computer/server and leave it open all the time. Failing that, the listing is put offline and the vendor cannot make any sale. It is possible to host your shop on a third-party server to make it more reliable in terms of uptime, but that is taking the control out of your hands and a security risk as well as going against the decentralization principle of the crypto world. OpenBazaar plans to launch a second version of their marketplace using IPFS which would allegedly eliminate the need to have a computer open at all time, but that does imply that they will need to introduce a fee structure to their platform.</p><p>With Syscoin, there are other problems that I see. The first one is that the user-experience is simply horrible and the wallet itself is not eye-appealing at all. Their solution for this was to create BlockMarket, a more user-friendly but <strong>closed-source</strong> interface interacting with the Syscoin blockchain. While it is definitely better looking than its Syscoin backend, it is still years away from any kind of mass adoption and its look would most likely turn off anyone that is not involved in crypto. What worries me the most about Blockmarket, however, is that it is basically a glorified centralized marketplace. In fact, The Blockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control over what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor listings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform as it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers, making it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also, purely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl because people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch Syscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter automatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order for a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with Bitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also should be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the proof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of great features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings. Lastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very popular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data are stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on DSNs).</p><p>Though it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not. I do believe this kind of industry can and will have enough place for more than one marketplace. After all, we have Etsy, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist and Alibaba all co-existing and sharing the same space, but with each one having its niche features and appeal to different audiences. There is nothing indicating that this could not be the case in the crypto world as well. Here, Particl definitely is the most secure and private solution, and this is what excites me the most as a privacy enthusiast.</p><p>We should also not forget about centralized, well-established marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. These giants sure do have a huge share of the global market and have some really great features decentralized marketplace can probably not even dream of offering (at least for now), but they do have negatives that decentralized solutions can do better. Please refer to the previous “Target Users” section of this presentation, or read my previous article on this very subject by following this link: <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad</a></p><p>I believe that decentralized marketplaces can compete with centralized ones in these aspects:</p><p>- Controversial &amp; potentially illegal goods &amp; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &amp; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &amp; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><h3 id=\"as-a-dapp-platform\">As A Dapp Platform</h3><p>Even though the competition with Dapp platforms such as Ethereum, Stratis, Lisk or Tezos in not as direct as Particl competition in the marketplace sector, it is still a platform on which more “Dapps” than the marketplace will be built. It is very important to understand that we are not talking about smart-contract Dapps here, but rather hard-coded decentralized applications. To give you an idea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice Dapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was abandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of what kind of Dapps Particl could host. The use of DSNs open up a lot of possibilities, I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended getting decentralized Netflix/Youtube/Music Stores powered by DSNs such as IPFS or Siacoin.</p><p>The main difference with Ethereum in terms of Dapp is that Ethereum is more like an operating system similar to Linux where users are given full liberty to code any smart-contract with its native programming language (Solidity), whereas Particl is more like a WeChat-style application on which apps (not smart-contracts) can be added to. To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer, Particl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day have its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized application they want to have on their Particl wallet. It is worth noting that Particl Dapps are probably going to be much more scalable than smart-contract platforms as they would work using DSNs (SMSG is not immensely scalable, but IPFS, Siacoin or SafeNetwork are).</p><h2 id=\"conclusion-personal-comments\">Conclusion &amp; Personal Comments</h2><p>For all the reasons and features mentioned during this presentation, I believe Particl is one of the most under-rated and undervalued projects of the crypto space at the moment. Its impressive set of privacy tools, its highly profitable staking reward schedule, and its highly scalable marketplace/Dapp ecosystem makes it extremely likely that Particl will become a popular and widely used crypto-currency in the not-so-distant future. Another thing that I really like about it is that it is building an entire <strong>ecosystem</strong> rather than being a simple “feature coin” (a coin that mostly does ONE thing well). Not only does having a working ecosystem around your coin make it more resilient to being outdated by newer technologies, it also creates a real demand for it rather than just deriving its value from trade speculation. This ecosystem is supported by a 5% (which will most likely turn into 10%) yearly investment return, on which is added market/Dapps/Txs fees and busted escrow funds.</p><p>Let’s crunch some numbers. If one would buy <strong>$25,000 </strong>worth of PARTs at <strong>$25</strong>, it would give him a total of <strong>1,000 PARTs</strong>. If he were to stake his entire balance, he would be guaranteed 5% yearly, paid every day. The actual more likely number would probably be 8–10%, so let’s round it up to 9%. This staker would make around <strong>0.25 PARTs per day</strong> (1,000 x 0.09 / 365 = 0.24657), or about<strong> $6.16</strong>. At the end of a full year, considering no PARTs were spent, he would have an estimated balance of around 1090 PARTs, a 9% increase valued at around<strong> $2,250 profits</strong>. The actual formula to estimate staking profits per day is as follow: Balance x estimated yearly % returns / 365 x PART price</p><p>That amount, however, is assuming that no transaction happens in the marketplace and that no one makes any transaction on the blockchain since no transaction fees are added into the formula. To calculate how many additional PARTs one would from the marketplace fees, it is possible to use this formula:</p><p>(Estimated number of marketplace listings x 0.01 x 0.5) / 100 x (PART balance x 100 / Particl total circulating supply)</p><p>If the marketplace was to host<strong> 50,000 listings</strong>, the staker in the example above would receive an additional <strong>0.3 PART a day</strong>, or<strong> 11.93 PARTs a year</strong>. At <strong>$25 </strong>per coin, that would earn him additional $298.20 per year for a total of <strong>$2,548.20.</strong></p><p>Again, there are some missing numbers that are harder to calculate such as daily transaction fees and busted escrow funds, so it is almost certain that the actual staking profits the staker in this example would make in real life would be bigger. It is also not taking into consideration the future Particl Dapps that will end up generating fees as well, making staking rewards even larger. I really do believe these interesting figure could propel Particl into top 10 cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Please visit this link to download a spreadsheet I’ve made that will help you calculate your staking revenues taking compounding, Particl Foundation donation and market fees into consideration: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>The only major problem I see with the currency itself is that it could eventually have scalability problems similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum during popular ICOs. Yes, the project will soon get Lightning Network once it is ready, but it is likely that it would be mostly useful for micro-transactions rather than ALL types of transactions. Besides, RingCT transactions cannot be processed through LN and are certainly NOT lightweight in terms of what space they use within a block. Even though I have heard from one solid and reliable source that the team does have plans and methods they are exploring that could potentially make its currency scalable similar to DASH’s levels, nothing has been publicly revealed (or even hinted at), so it shouldn’t be taken into consideration until this is publicly discussed. However, if Particl should ever have currency scalability problems, it would actually be a pretty good problem as that means the platform would already be quite popular and its coin very valuable. Note that there is a distinction to make between currency scalability and market scalability, the latter being already successfully dealt with.</p><h2 id=\"additional-resources\">Additional Resources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.io/\">Particl landing page</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl news</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/\">Particl’s GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Whitepaper draft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/particlproject\">Particl Twitter account</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/\">Particl Reddit page</a></li><li><a href=\"http://slack.particl.io/\">Slack channel invite</a></li><li><a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org\">Riot channel</a></li><li><a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Particl-Testnet-Getting-Started-d9yhExvCaW6vCp3qLUwuW\">Latest testnet binaries</a></li><li><a href=\"http://explorer.testnet.particl.io/insight/\">Testnet block explorer</a></li><li>Contact info: <a href=\"mailto:hello@particl.io\">hello@particl.io</a></li></ul><p>This concludes this Particl presentation.

Thank you!</em></p><p>Hey guys,</p><p>I’ve been following an interesting cryptocurrency project for some time and have noticed that very little information was available about it online, so I’ve decided to write a complete in-depth presentation of it. I do believe this project has a lot of potential investment-wise due to its great technology and vision, this is why I wanted to share it with you. This article is going to be quite lengthy, so buckle up.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-is-particl\">What is Particl?</h2><p>To sum it up briefly, Particl is a privacy-focused blockchain/P2P hybrid ecosystem that will host a decentralized and anonymous marketplace as well as an array of Dapps using a native cryptocurrency. The first officially supported Particl Dapp will be a fully decentralized and anonymous marketplace which allows buyers and vendors to securely transact between each other without the need to ever interact with a third-party. It also encompasses a fully anonymous messaging system built similarly to BitMessage. The platform is currency and protocol agnostic (more details on what this means later in the presentation).</p><p>Note, however, that these Dapps are not the same kind of Dapps as on Ethereum. They do NOT work using smart contracts but are instead hard-coded into the client. This makes Dapps much more secure and efficient.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-its-history\">What’s Its History?</h2><p>Particl is the successor of the ShadowProject (<a href=\"https://shadowproject.io/en\">https://shadowproject.io/en</a>), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project started back in August 2014. The team behind this project are known for being innovators in the cryptocurrency scene, being the first to produce many feats such as an HTML5 wallet, a staking mobile wallet with encrypted messaging and transactions, as well as having the first ring signature and HD wallet implementation on BTC codebase. Their Umbra graphical wallet, built using HTML5, is widely known in the “altcoin” community for being absolutely gorgeous and very user-friendly. It was not so long after switching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that this very capable team started working on a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. This has long been seen has the ultimate value proposition of the Shadowcash blockchain.</p><p>Back in late December 2016, word spread around the community that the ShadowProject team had met with major partners in Hong Kong and that big things were coming regarding the way forward. Then, on March 17th, the team announced they were leaving the ShadowProject to start working on a new and more professional project: Particl. This move was encouraged by the fact that the team wanted to have a more professional branding and were looking for funding so that they could work full-time on it and get it going for good. In fact, they had been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms, that the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to associate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the project also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC blockchain/client and team structure. It is for all these reasons the SDC team decided to completely sever the link between Shadowcash and Particl and start the new blockchain from scratch, using their final Umbra release as prototype for the new platform.</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-foundation\">The Particl Foundation</h2><p>The Particl Foundation is a registered Swiss legal entity. As the Particl team was looking to raise money to fund the project, they needed to have a legal body that could receive the funds and spend on behalf of the project. It is also required for most of the logistics of the project (hiring and paying employees, paying hosting fees for the website, etc.) as well as interacting with third-parties (partners, exchanges, gateways, legal &#x26; PR firm contracts, etc.). There will be many more details to come once the Foundation is officially registered. It is currently awaiting approval by the Swiss government and it is the last step to be up and running.</p><p>As a funding strategy, the Particl team offered SDC holders an opportunity to swap their SDCs for PARTs at a 1:1 rate, with the possibility for the holder to add an additional amount of BTC to the swap transaction to get a variable PART bonus added to their stash. This extra BTC is what the team collected as funding as SDCs sent into swap transactions were not and will never be sold into the market.</p><p>They have raised 750,000 USD worth of Bitcoin (now worth around 1.4M), and reserved for themselves 513,502 PARTs (6% of total supply) from the total supply. Another 996,000 PARTs are reserved for a second funding round once the MVP of the market is out and released. The funds they raised will be used for salaries, legal expenses for Swiss Foundation creation, initial business consultation expenses, new team members, professional PR, third-party code audits and University grants.</p><p>While it may have been tempting to raise more money, the reasoning behind this crowdfund structure is actually quite sane. The total amount raised is what the team estimated were necessary to run the project for one full year. It is true that other ICOs are raising tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, but in many cases, the development team simply doesn’t need that much money. It could be argued that as these projects raise tons of money, they lose a certain incentive to work hard on their project as they have already cashed out on their idea. In more traditional VC environments, you would very rarely (if ever) see projects raise hundreds of millions of dollars with only ideas, vague whitepaper, and no working products. It is also likely that some of these projects will attract the attention of regulatory bodies due to questionable funding methods.</p><p>The Particl team has mimicked the VC way of initially going through a seed round before going for a larger round of funding. This crowdfund strategy is what was advised by Swiss legal firms which are used to working with blockchain projects. Also, not only does this structure allows for a fair money-raising method, it also incentivizes the Particl team to work hard on their project and deliver a working product that will impress the community. After all, they will want to raise as much money as possible in the second round, and with a maximum of 996,000 PARTs that can be offered, they have all the reasons in the world to make a good product which would bring more value to the Particl coin. When we think about it, this crowdfunds/ICO was pretty fair and exemplary from a legal standpoint.</p><h2 id=\"particl-features\">Particl Features</h2><p><strong>Quick video presentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU</a></p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-blockchain-will-launch-monday-july-17th-2017-at-13-00-utc-3348e8958657\">July 17th 2017, 13:00 UTC</a></p><p><strong>Currency name: </strong>Particl (not to be confused with Particle)</p><p><strong>Currency ticker: </strong>PART (not PRT, which is Particle’s ticker)</p><p><strong>Supported by: </strong>Particl Foundation (Swiss Foundation)</p><p><strong>Total supply:</strong> 8,634,140 PARTs</p><p><strong>Particl Foundation ownership:</strong> 513,502 PARTs (6%)</p><p><strong>First funding round contributors ownership:</strong> 7,124,638 PARTs (82.5%)</p><p><strong>Funds time-locked for 2nd funding round:</strong> 996,000 (11.5%)</p><p><strong>Network consensus:</strong> Proof-of-stake (PoSv3)</p><p><strong>Block time:</strong> 120 sec</p><p><strong>Block size: </strong>~2mb</p><p><strong>Inflation:</strong> 5% year 1, 4% year 2, 3% year 3, 2% year 4+</p><p><strong>Available on: </strong>Windows, OSX, Linux and ARM (Raspberry PI, BeagleBone Black, etc)</p><h2 id=\"bitcoin-codebase\">Bitcoin Codebase</h2><p>Particl is a privacy platform using its own native currency, PART. It is built on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase (0.14.2) on which the dev team <strong>added as much as 100,000 new lines of code</strong> (as of the time of this publication) to turn it into a completely unique coin filled with a ton of cool features. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to ever exist, it is the coin that everyone knows how to work with and also the most battle tested blockchain. For these reasons, it could easily be argued that Bitcoin has the safest codebase on which to build on top of.</p><p>Some other features inherited from the current Bitcoin codebase version include (but is not limited to) <strong>HD wallets, multi-sig addresses</strong> (fully integrated into graphical wallet),<strong> block pruning</strong> (saves quite a lot of disk space after the chain is fully synced),<strong> fast syncing, easy tor setup, watch-only wallet support, libsecp256k1 signing and signature validation, direct headers announcement, notifications through ZMQ, compact block support and ARM builds.</strong> You can read this article to get more information on these features: <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/\">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/</a></p><h2 id=\"dual-token-system\">Dual Token System</h2><p>Why should we have to choose between privacy and convenience when we can have both on the same chain? This is the premise behind one of the major changes the team has made to the Bitcoin codebase: a dual token system. Particl uses two different tokens that can seamlessly be transferred for one another. One of these is a public token, which carries the <strong>same pseudo-anonymity characteristics as Bitcoin</strong>, while the second one is a <strong>completely anonymous and private coin</strong>. Users can easily send public coins into private balances, and the wallet automatically converts the public coin into a private coin. The same can be done if a user sends a private coin into a public address. Sending a private token to a private address successfully “mixes” your coins and allows you to maintain top-of-the-line privacy. Note that it will be very easy and effortless to do these conversions within the GUI wallet.</p><h3 id=\"public-token\">Public Token</h3><p>While Particl is mainly a privacy-focused project, the use of a public token (default token) is very important in terms of management, integration, and security. <br>One of the problems with exclusively anonymous currencies is that it can be hard to confirm the authenticity of the block creation process. What if an attacker had the key to generate an infinite amount of coins? What if no one noticed the hack until the attacker dumps large orders of fraudulently created coins on the trading market? These are very serious threats that are a reality with some of the 100% private coins. ZK SNARKS, for example, a crypto privacy protocol, also has this “hidden inflation problem”. In fact, the chain is initially generated from a set of master keys which could theoretically be used to generate an infinite amount of coins at any time without anyone ever noticing. This is why people say this protocol relies on “trusted setups”; you actually need to trust the party who spawned the chain would successfully destroy the master keys. There is, of course, no way to know for sure whether they didn’t keep copies somewhere or that they were not compromised during any step of the process (software, hardware, network, OS, BIOS, ME chip exploits). After all, cryptocurrencies are now worth a lot and they have become the primary target for hackers around the world.</p><p>It is precisely for these reasons that the Particl team opted for a fully transparent coin generation process. Because all newly generated coins are public, a hacker/bug would instantly be detected and measures could be taken to fix the problem.</p><p>Additionally, since the public token is built in a very similar way as Bitcoin, it is much easier for third-parties such as exchanges, websites, and wallets (Jaxx, Exodus, Ledger Wallet, etc.) to integrate. They do not need to go out of their way and spend many dev hours without knowing if it will be economically worth it to integrate that coin. The best example I could find concerning this, in particular, is the case of Monero and Jaxx. Jaxx is a well-known multi-cryptocurrency wallet and they tried to integrate Monero earlier this year. After trying to add the coin to their wallet, they announced they would finally not do it because it was too complicated and they didn’t feel the amount of dev time required for this project would be worth it. This would not happen with Particl as the BTC codebase is what everybody is used to working with and can integrate it without much effort.</p><p>This public token is also very useful for people who do not necessarily require a permanently anonymous experience. Fully-anonymous currencies can sometimes hinder one’s ability to effectively keep track of financial records and transactions. Some services ask for extra information (i.e. a payment ID for Monero) in order for a transaction to be accepted and there are many situations where one could forget to note that transaction ID down or lose it afterward. There’s also a lot of scenarios where one would need to go back several months into the past to see specific transaction details. In most cases, it is simply harder to keep track of things with fully private coins so having one that does possess great accountability tools is definitively a plus.</p><p>On top of this, a transaction using any privacy coin is generally going to cost more in fees than a public transaction on a non-bloated BTC codebase currency as it typically involves more data movement and computation. A “public user”, one that does not necessarily want to be anonymous, should not have to pay for privacy features he does not need. By making the public token the default coin, this ensures that only users seeking privacy options will use the privacy token, while the public users (which will probably end up being the majority of Particl users if the platform becomes mainstream) default to the public token. This also has the non-negligible effect of putting less stress on the network (as public transactions are more lightweight and do not fill blocks as much as private ones), keeping the network efficient.</p><h3 id=\"private-token\">Private Token</h3><p>Particl’s private token has a variable degree of privacy which can be adjusted by users according to their preferences. In fact, when making a private transaction, it is possible to send it using Confidential Transactions or RingCT (which is a blend of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions). It is noteworthy to mention that <strong>this is the first time both these protocols are being implemented on the Bitcoin codebase</strong>. While a few coins use Confidential Transactions as their privacy protocol, only one uses an implementation of RingCT on their main net: Monero.</p><p>Confidential Transactions, or CT, is a privacy protocol initially developed for Bitcoin that hides amounts sent from the public and makes it visible only to parties involved in the actual transaction. While it is very efficient to obfuscate most regular person-to-person transactions, its most interesting use case is when used in Particl’s marketplace decentralized escrow system. As a matter of fact, if the market’s escrow system worked using the public token, it would be trivial for determined attackers to detect patterns in the public escrow contracts and match them to potential users. On a long enough timeline, users could be identified with particular marketplace orders with a high degree of certainty. With the help of Confidential Transactions, this cuts off this attack vector and makes the escrow system fully anonymous. To learn more about CT, please consult this link: <a href=\"https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt\">https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt</a></p><p>RingCT, on the other side, is an even better privacy protocol combining ring signatures to the aforementioned confidential transaction protocol. Applied on double stealth addresses, not only transaction amounts are hidden but the sender and receiver addresses as well, making RingCT transactions completely untraceable. It should be taken into consideration that RingCT will not be available when Particl first launches, but will it be implemented soon enough. This feature is currently on testnet #3, but it still requires some work before it is incorporated into the main chain. The team also wants to have it fully audited by a third-party before going live with it.</p><p>One useful feature of the Particl wallet is that users are actually presented with the option to choose the privacy protocol they want to use according to their needs. CT is a good privacy protocol for basic privacy, but RingCT is even better as it makes transactions unlinkable. However, the latter is much more expensive in fees than the first one, and people who do not require a “paranoid” level of privacy may not want to pay larger fees.</p><p>In my subjective opinion, Particl will offer the best privacy experience on the market as it is very flexible but makes no compromise. RingCT is considered top-of-the-line technology and it simply works fantastically in preserving one’s privacy. Some could argue that ZK-SNARKS offers a better solution, and that is rightfully debatable. They do offer an interesting privacy solution, but they do have their share of problems and vulnerabilities as mentioned above. Centralized coin mixers are obviously not to be trusted as there is no way to know the legitimacy of the website owner, and coinjoin services are demonstrably weak and exploitable by determined adversaries.</p><p>The hidden inflation problem is also one of the reasons why I believe Particl, with its dual token system, has a “safer” (and easier to integrate) implementation of RingCT than Monero. Don’t get me wrong, there are good arguments people could make about Monero having the better integration. For example, RingCT being mandatory and by default on all transactions makes it impossible to make a basic human mistake (they do happen), but it also makes Monero a more expensive currency to use and a blockchain less likely to be able to support a huge influx of users (as transactions are heavy and would bloat the blockchain faster). This is the kind of debate where both sides have pros and cons, so I will let you make your own conclusion on this topic.</p><p>Also related to Particl’s privacy but not its private coin, it is possible to route the wallet’s connection through TOR in order to keep your node IP address private. This is absolutely needed if you want a secure staking setup (unless you used OpenVPN with solid network rules) as broadcasting the real IP address of a staking node to the world is asking for trouble.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-person-to-person-marketplace\">Decentralized &#x26; Anonymous Person-to-person Marketplace</h2><p>Quoted from <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Particl’s whitepaper draft</a>: “<em>Satoshi Nakamoto, the visionary and creator of Bitcoin, originally intended that Bitcoin is paired with a marketplace, as evidenced by beginnings of a market framework included in early snapshots of the Bitcoin codebase. The market-related code was eventually stripped out, however, presumably as he decided to focus first on creating his world-changing currency. The concept of a decentralized marketplace in itself is not novel, there have been a small set of academic constructions and even serious attempts at creating them. They either propose solutions that scale extremely well and neglect the privacy implications, or they propose very privacy conscious solutions that do not scale well. Privacy and efficiency are often at odds with each other,” to hide the signal there must be noise”. Tor exemplifies this well, the traffic is pushed through various nodes with several layers of encryption before arriving at its destination, it is deliberately inefficient but the privacy provided by the</em><br><em>trade-off is well worth it”.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-9M6fKKTzuuy1DhCwp7jtGQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Marketplace mock up posted during the fundraiser (Confirmed outdated, but gives a rough idea where the team is going visually speaking)</figcaption></figure><p>In development for about two years, the Particl marketplace strives to be the <strong>first</strong> decentralized marketplace to <strong>successfully nail scalability and full privacy at the same time</strong>. The team aspires to achieve this accomplishment by using the OMP market protocol they developed internally.</p><h3 id=\"open-market-protocol\">Open Market Protocol</h3><p>The Open Market Protocol, or OMP, is a <em>“standardized and open format that can encompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace” (</em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><em>https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/</em></a><em>#)</em>. The OMP is built with three main components in mind, namely extensibility, privacy, and market data portability. It can be adopted by anyone who wishes to build a decentralized market of some sort.</p><p>Its <em>extensibility</em> characteristic makes it much more resilient to new, more efficient technologies to come out. This aspect is explained in details in the Protocol-agnosticism section of this presentation.</p><p><em>Privacy</em> is also an important cornerstone of this protocol. <em>“Recent revelations and academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active threats to our digital privacy and security. Additionally, decentralized networks, as well as blockchains, are open public books full of sensitive information for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when designing [the OMP] protocol as it could potentially put [its] users at risk”</em></p><p>Portability is the ability to easily move market data such as inventory, images and shipping details (among others) data between different markets. “<em>One of the many frustrations that online merchants and vendors suffer is the lack of portability of the inventory data between the many different online marketplaces. The more markets your products are available on, the greater their exposure and thus the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet importing the inventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process, often on purpose to prevent vendors from using competition” </em>By making market data standardized, it becomes very easy for vendors to open a shop on any marketplace using the OMP protocol and realize their full economic potential.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-trust-less-escrow-system\">Decentralized &#x26; Trust-less Escrow System</h3><p>There are many challenges in designing a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. One of these is to ensure that neither the vendors nor the buyers get scammed by the other party. How do you make sure the vendor doesn’t simply take the money and not ship the product? How do you make sure the buyer actually pays for a shipped product? In most cases, typical marketplaces such as Alibaba, eBay or Amazon use what is called an escrow system. The platform acts as a middle-man and receives the payment of a product or service on behalf of the vendor and holds on to it until the buyer confirms he has received the product. Should problems arise, the escrow agent will usually take the role of a mediator and decide what happens to the escrowed funds (it will either be a refund for the buyer or a release of funds to the vendor).</p><p>Since the Particl marketplace aims to be entirely trustless, it cannot use escrow agents as that constitutes centralization. An agent could be wrong on a decision, go rogue, collude with a party, and above all, <strong>they always charge a fee</strong>. No escrow agent will work for free.</p><p>The Particl team developed what they call the MAD escrow system. This trust-less and free service is based on the Mutually Assisted Destruction game theory. As defined on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\">Wikipedia</a>, Mutual assured destruction (or mutual assisted destruction) “is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm”.</p><p>In the context of an escrow system, it simply means that the escrow is designed in such a way that it financially punishes both parties if one of them behaves badly. The MAD escrow works by requiring the buyer to deposit twice the amount of the desired product in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow address, while the vendor has to deposit the full value of the item he is selling as insurance. Both parties need to sign the release of the funds before a set time for the deal to conclude, otherwise, the escrow busts and funds are sent over to the stakers.</p><p>For example, if you were selling a 500$ TV to a user, you would have to fund the MAD escrow with 500$ and your buyer would need to fund it with 1,000$ (500$ item value + 100% insurance deposit of 500$). The document section of the shadowproject.io website explains in an understandable fashion how the psychology behind MAD escrow works:</p><p>From <a href=\"https://doc.shadowproject.io/#mutual-assured-destruction-mad\">ShadowProject’s documentation page</a>: <em>“If the buyer receives the item and decides not to finalize the transaction then the address becomes unspendable after the expiration date and neither party gets their insurance deposit back. The buyer will have effectively paid twice the price but the vendor loses his insurance deposit and the item. [If] the vendor does not to ship the item, [it] leaves the buyer with the option to finalize the transaction or not: finalizing the transaction causes him to minimalize his losses to one time the price of the item and the vendor makes a profit of one time the item price. If the buyer decides not to finalize the transaction he loses twice the amount of the item price but also causes the vendor to lose his insurance deposit. The buyer is to some extent at a disadvantage and motivated to finalize the transaction to minimize his losses in case of a vendor scam. Both the buyer and the vendor will be motivated to extend the escrow transaction and work towards a refund agreement that both parties are willing to sign.”</em></p><p>Of course, this MAD escrow system is flexible. If a problem arises during a transaction, both parties can agree to either extend the escrow deadline time or proceed with partial refunds. It is also entirely up to the users to decide what insurance deposit percentage they want to use. A vendor and a buyer could agree for a 25% insurance deposit, meaning that for a 500$ TV purchase, a vendor would need to deposit 125$ into the escrow while the buyer would need to deposit 625$ (500$ + 25% insurance deposit of 125$).</p><h3 id=\"self-governance\">Self-Governance</h3><p>Another of the big challenges in designing a decentralized and anonymous market is trying to reduce the irresponsible and criminal use of the platform as much as possible. Since it is censorship-resistant, no central authority can delete its content and so it could easily be abused by criminals, spammers, and trolls. This would end up making the platform look much less appealing to the regular honest user and enable undesirable activities.</p><p>Particl’s solution to this problem is a self-governance system where users can flag undesirable content. At this moment, it is not confirmed whether a listing considered undesirable is completely taken out of the market or if it puts it in an NSFW kind of state where users can decide whether they want that type of content to be displayed or not (similar to how OpenBazaar does it). The method of governance is also not confirmed, but if we are to speculate, it could possibly be tied to staking like Particl’s voting system works (will be explained later in this document).</p><h3 id=\"private-listings\">Private Listings</h3><p>As mentioned just above, there is a self-governance in place preventing the platform from essentially becoming a decentralized version of the infamous Silkroad marketplace. There is, however, a form of listing which cannot be flagged by the community: private listings. These listings do not appear on the public marketplace and are hidden even from the blockchain itself as they are fully encrypted. Only a vendor and a user possessing a specific link to the listing can have access to its content, making it a very interesting use-case for alternative markets as anyone could simply run a website making external references to these private listings, fundamentally creating the perfect semblance of a 100% anonymous and censorship-proof (even from Particl’s self-governance system) marketplace that cannot get hacked, be busted or exit scam their users.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>As mentioned above, spammers are another major concern on popular blockchain platforms. In the crypto world, there are many reasons why one would want to mount a spam attack on a chain. It could be because that entity wants to short the coin on trading markets, or because he has invested in a competing platform that is seeking to destroy the reputation of Particl.</p><p>Fighting spam attacks will always remain an ongoing battle as spammers will always try to find new ways to make themselves an annoyance, and the Particl team plans on keeping the platform spam-free a priority. On market release, the platform will already be armed with two spam-fighting features other than the self-governance flagging system.</p><p>The first one of these measures is to make listings stay up for a maximum of 48 hours. That means a spammer has to constantly keep the attack up otherwise it will not have any long-term damage to the platform. This also helps the market be much more scalable as it only requires to have two days worth of listings. The second measure is the implementation of a very small listing fee (initially 0.01 PART, can be adjusted and ultimately made dynamic) making a sustained attack quite costly for an attacker. While the fees are quite small, mounting a considerably effective spam attack would require large amounts of funds to be paid to the market every two days.</p><p>As will be explained further down this presentation, market fees actually go to the stakers (people who run nodes that secure the network), which brings an interesting dynamic…<strong>Any spammer that wants to heavily spam the Particl marketplace inevitably ends up sending his money to the very community he is trying to bring down!</strong></p><h3 id=\"going-mainstream\">Going Mainstream</h3><p>The project doesn’t hide the fact that it wishes to become the first decentralized marketplace to become used in the multi-billion “mainstream” world of commerce. This is why user-friendliness and usability are at the core of the team’s strategy. The ultimate goal is to make the cryptocurrency side of things all in the background so that even your grandmother could intuitively use it.</p><p>Another mainstream-appealing feature the team is working on is the integration of many in-client fiat gateways from which one could fund his Particl wallet. Some solutions being explored at the moment would allow users to use bank transfers, credit cards, and Localbitcoin-style services. Note, however, that neither the Particl developing team nor the Particl Foundation are licensed financial organizations, therefore this implementation most certainly would be the result of partnerships with other services (i.e. Changelly, Tether, etc.). It would be very surprising if fiat gateways were part of the initial release of the wallet.</p><h3 id=\"low-fees\">Low Fees</h3><p>One great thing about the Particl marketplace is its relatively low prices compared to centralized competitors. In fact, selling on websites such as Amazon or Alibaba is great because they bring vendors a lot of users, but they also charge a huge premium just so their user base can be leveraged. After all, it is generally Amazon/Alibaba/eBay that brings a company new customers, not the other way around, so that premium fee is the price to pay to get new customers from these big e-commerce platforms.</p><p>Let’s take Alibaba, for example. It is one of the most valued e-commerce websites on the internet and has a huge user base of both buyers, merchants, service providers and suppliers. If you wanted to start selling products on it, you would probably want to get a gold membership so you don’t get absolutely buried in the thousands of listing and so that you at least have a minimum set of features you could use. Their gold membership is subscription based and according to Harry Peterson, a professional in China sourcing and B2B (business-to-business) marketing, businesses located in mainland China need to pay almost up to $5,000 USD a year just to get their membership. Businesses outside China mainland have variable subscription fees based on which jurisdiction they are doing business from, but it is estimated that an average subscription amounts to around $2,999 USD a year (<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba\">https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba</a>). On the Alibaba website itself, subscription fees seem to be even higher, now priced at $5,999 USD a year for the full package (<a href=\"http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html\">http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html</a>).</p><p>Of course, there are various packages and these fees are somewhat flexible, but that gives you an idea what a gold membership costs if you want to use Alibaba as a platform and get the whole set of features that will allow you to leverage the full capacity of what the platform has to offer. Don’t forget that on top of these memberships, Alibaba charges a whopping 5% fee on any transactions done through its escrow system, as it is centralized and requires staff to manage. All these fees, end up being costly for both buyers and sellers. Remember that Particl’s MAD (mutually assisted destruction) escrow system is absolutely free of charge as it is entirely decentralized and managed by both the buyer and the vendor.</p><p>Amazon, on the other hand, chooses a different fee schedule to make its money by applying two types of fees. The first one is a generic “per-item” selling fee. You can choose two plans: the individual plan, which charges $0.99 USD per items sold, or a professional plan, which is a subscription of $39,99 USD per month (<a href=\"https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm\">https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm</a>).</p><p>On top of that, it also charges what is called a “referral fee” which is a percentage of your item’s value that Amazon keeps for itself. This fee ranges from 6% to an almost insulting 25% depending on the item’s category. Some Amazon-branded items can even go up to 45%. Please visit this detailed article to know the exact fee schedule Amazon uses: <a href=\"http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/\">http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/</a>. There is also another type of fee which Amazon can charge, but that only applies if you want Amazon to fulfill your order (meaning you send your inventory to Amazon and they do the processing, storage, and shipping for you). These fees are all indicated in the CPC strategy article I linked just above.</p><p>What about eBay? While listing an item isn’t really that expensive, your first 50 listings of each month being free and the subsequent being $0.30 USD, the website still charges you a non-negligible 10% “final value fee” (the final value is calculated AFTER shipping fees are applied) with a maximum of $750 USD per transaction. You can visit this link which details all the listings (plus some advanced feature fees I will not go into): <a href=\"http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html\">http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html</a></p><p>Etsy? Well, it is admittedly much cheaper, but still considerably more expensive than Particl. They charge $0.20 USD per listing posted and then apply a “transaction fee” of 3.5% (which isn’t applied to shipping cost as well if you are selling either from the USA or Canada but is applied otherwise). There are also various other fees if you wish to use more advanced features such as Etsy’s “Direct Checkout”. For their fee schedule, please visit this link here: <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/\">https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/</a>.</p><p>As it is probably obvious by now, these platforms charge their users HUGE premiums, which is kind of understandable since they are critical to the success of a good number of these vendors. Particl is going to be a much, much cheaper option for vendors, regardless if they are big or small. It will also greatly benefit buyers by basically charging them no fees at all except low cryptocurrency transaction fees (listing fees are paid for by vendors). Vendors will only need to pay 0.01 PART per listing renewed every two days. This fee is likely to be made dynamic so that it goes down when PART’s price goes up and vice versa.</p><h3 id=\"target-users\">Target Users</h3><p>Going for the mainstream world of e-commerce certainly is a huge ambition. It is true that a decentralized system is likely to be less efficient than its centralized counterparts, but it does also offer services that giants like eBay, Amazon or Alibaba simply cannot provide to their customers: privacy and censorship-resistance. So who, exactly, would end up using a potentially less efficient but more private platform than well-established e-commerce Goliaths?</p><p>During the time of the initial funding round, I’ve <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">written a lengthy article </a>going over exactly this question. Here’s a tl;dr list of potential early users:</p><p>- Controversial &#x26; potentially illegal goods &#x26; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &#x26; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &#x26; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><p>This article only lists what I could think of at the time, but the potential of a decentralized marketplace and escrow system is huge and there are some use-cases one could not think of until someone actually comes out with it. A potential use case not featured in my previous article which became apparent to me since is the use of Particl marketplace’s escrow system for OTC exchange of unreleased ICO coin accounts (trading coins before their chain is released). This seems to be an increasingly popular practice within the crypto world, with most vendors/buyers doing these trades on Slack/Reddit.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency-Agnosticism</h3><p>By definition, “an agnostic person is one who believes it is impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine”. In our context, the platform is considered “agnostic” because its developing team does not believe its native coin should be created with a “one coin to rule them all” mentality and thus should have a platform that can work with as many cryptocurrencies as possible. As we do not know what coins will be the most used in 5 years, let alone in a month, it is safe and forward-thinking to make the platform be ready to work with them at any time.</p><p>This feature will mostly be used for the Particl marketplace Dapp, as it will allow people to shop online using their favorite cryptocurrency without ever leaving the wallet or having to manually trade their coins prior to purchasing a product. While it may seem like that would reduce Particl’s potential valuation as that would generate less demand for its native coin, it actually does not. Because the market’s decentralized escrow is a 2 of 2 multi-sig CT PART address,<strong> it requires any non-PART purchases to be traded (automatically done by the wallet) for PART to operate.</strong> Vendors do not even need to state what coins they want to accept, as they all get paid in PART. They are then free to Shapeshift back to any coin they want, again without ever leaving the wallet.</p><p>This currency-agnosticism actually brings a lot of value to the platform’s native coin. For one, any order made on the market, whether it is paid using PART, BTC, ETH or any compatible currency, ends up being a buy order for PART. This feature also brings a non-speculative use case for all compatible currencies, as the holders of those coins can now shop online with them and not simply hold them for speculative reasons. This has the potential to end up putting a lot of buy pressure on the PART coin.</p><h3 id=\"shapeshift-integration\">Shapeshift Integration</h3><p>This ability to seamlessly shop with any coin is powered by Shapeshift. That means that any coin available on their platform can be used to shop on Particl. Some of the use cases I personally find interesting is the use of the DGX token (gold-backed cryptocurrency, not yet available on Shapeshift though…) and USDt (fiat USD-backed cryptocurrency) to seamlessly shop with coins that are backed by real assets. Gold bugs will immediately understand why this is a big deal, but let’s pause for a moment and appreciate what opportunity it presents. When was the last time people could just go out and shop using actual gold coins? The way it is designed, the vendor does not even have to “accept” the currency on his store, and you can send tiny fractions of that gold coin (which is obviously impossible with physical bullion). This could become a really big use case for Particl if the world economy ends up crashing and people abandon fiat for value-based assets such as gold. This could even initiate a paradigm shift in how people conduct commerce around the world.</p><p>Note, however, that this Shapeshift integration is a temporary solution as the team plans on designing its own fully decentralized and trust-less currency exchange system. This is due for much later though, and I believe that for the time being Shapeshift will be more than satisfying as an option.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol-Agnosticism</h3><p>In this context, being protocol agnostic refers to the fact that the Particl platform does not limit itself to one decentralized data storage protocol, but rather makes it extensible and easy to <strong>integrate various different protocols at the same time, and let the user choose which one he prefers using</strong>. As Kewde, a Particl developer, elegantly puts it on his Open Market Protocol GitBook: <em>“Technology moves at an exponential rate, and the very few protocols that survive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol looking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and flexible enough that it easily allows any developer to securely expand it. The development of decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and blockchain solutions is still young, there aren’t any clear “winners” that meet all criteria nor may there ever be, thus the protocol must accommodate for it”.</em></p><p>To illustrate why this is a good concept, let’s say Particl only uses its native SMSG protocol to run its marketplace on. That would work fine…until the marketplace gets very popular and cannot scale anymore because there are too many people using it. On a protocol-agnostic platform, it would be very easy to simply add a new, more scalable protocol to support the flock of new users, but if it wasn’t designed with extensibility in mind, it would be stuck with a technology that cannot support its own popularity. In most cases, the platform would either be abandoned by its users, require some kind of fork (which is risky), or the developing team would abandon the project and start a new one with better technology.</p><p>In other words, <strong>Particl is designed in such a way that it embraces new protocols instead of being rendered obsolete by them</strong>, and it does so without ever requiring a fork of some kind.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-network-storage\">Decentralized Network Storage</h3><p>Decentralized storage networks, or DSNs, are decentralized extensions “plugged” into the Particl protocol to help it store data in a decentralized and off-chain fashion. They are what I referred to as “new protocols” in the last section. The use of DSNs is essential as the Particl platform does not store its marketplace data on the blockchain itself as that would quickly bloat it and make everything much more inefficient. Here is an excerpt from Particl’s whitepaper draft: <br> <br> <em>“The Data Storage Network (DSN) is tasked with storing market listings as well as messages between sender and receiver and all other accompanying data (such as but not limited to images and videos). Sensu stricto the market listing references, stored in the blockchain, are also protocol-agnostic, simply meaning it can handle different DSN protocols such as BitMessage, IPFS, HTTPS…”</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-FuY-KpehaQSXH8Bf7634_Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of DSNs that could be integrated into Particl:</p><p>- HTTPs (Privacy:- ( — )<br>- TOR (Privacy: + + )<br>- SMSG (Privacy: + + + )<br>- * IPFS (Privacy: + )<br>- * Siacoin (Privacy: + )<br>- * Storj (Privacy: + )<br>- * SafeNetwork (Privacy: + + + )</p><p>* This DSN hasn’t been integrated yet or is not production-ready.</p><p>As there isn’t really a “best” solution, the Particl platform lets users choose which decentralized storage network they want to use. Some DSNs provide great anonymity characteristics but don’t scale as well as others (such as is the case with SMSG). Some provide great scaling capabilities but are more expensive to use. There is also the fact that some of these DSNs required a native token transfer (Sia, Storj, SafeNetwork), making the integration trickier (but still possible) and possibly less interesting for users. Don’t forget that these DSNs which use a native token either charge the uploader of content or the downloader depending on what storage network is being used.</p><p>While DSNs are mostly used by the marketplace application (and the messaging system in the case of SMSG), the agnostic and extensible design has been standardized by the team so that it can be easily deployed whenever the platform needs to interact with third-party software, once again ensuring that it never gets outpaced by new technologies but embraces them instead. It also has the potential to add use-cases to other blockchain projects (for example, providing a complete and decentralized merchant and escrow system to Siacoin).</p><h2 id=\"proof-of-stake-consensus-algorithm\">Proof-of-stake Consensus Algorithm</h2><p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake\">Wikipedia’s proof-of-stake page</a>,<em> “Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake)”.</em> Paid at every block, PoS basically financially rewards users for securing the network. It is also much easier to start staking than it is to start mining (as you need to buy a lot of equipment and do some research to understand how it all works), so it could be argued that PoS is a more decentralized and “people-friendly” decentralized consensus algorithm, only requiring users to buy coins, deposit them on their wallet and let it open as often as possible.</p><p>Particl uses a pretty recent version of PoS named PoSv3, and has a variable inflation rate that goes as follow:</p><p>Year 1: 5%<br>Year 2: 4% <br>Year 3: 3%<br>Year 4+: 2%</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-an-investment\">Staking As an Investment</h3><p>Particl’s inflation calendar has been designed this way to support the price during the adoption period by making it quite profitable to stake. Once the marketplace application is more popular and as staking rewards reduce over time, the “burden” of price support should organically transfer from speculators to marketplace users.</p><p>One thing that is important to understand about staking rewards is that you are guaranteed to get a 5% interest profit in the first year <strong>if 100% of the network’s coins are staking. </strong>Staking becomes increasingly more profitable as less and less people stake. This is a direct incentive to get as many nodes staking as possible. However, it is highly unrealistic to think the entire network would be staking as evidenced by Shadowcash’s historical statistics; the percentage of SDCs staking used to oscillate between 35%-50% of the entire network. On Particl, if 50% of the network was to stake their coins, that would mean you could expect an estimated 10% yield on your first year (if you let your wallet open 24/7).</p><p>Another interesting dynamic resulting from the way PoS was implemented is that market fees are paid directly to stakers. As explained earlier, the marketplace asks for a small 0.01 PART listing fee every 48 hours to fight spam. That means that as the market gets more activity, <strong>it becomes even more profitable</strong> for stakers. If it gets popular enough, it could completely nullify the effect of the decreasing inflation rate on staking rewards and possibly even making them bigger in the end. Other fees paid to stakers include regular transaction, CT and RingCT fees. Note that as the platform gets more Dapps other than the marketplace, the fees they generate would generally be sent to stakers.</p><p>Could there even be more financial incentives to stake? Yes, there is! As explained earlier, MAD escrows have a timer that forces both participating parties to release the funds before it runs out. This timer can, of course, be extended if both parties agree to, but what if it is not and the escrow runs out of time? All the funds are added to the staking rewards, which in some cases could amount to pretty big bonus rewards!</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-aparticl-foundation-self-funding-strategy\">Staking As aParticl Foundation Self-Funding Strategy</h3><p>When calculating potential staking rewards, it is important to deduct 10% from the final number. Why? The Particl Foundation didn’t want to simply rely on two funding rounds as they have a very long-term vision for the project, so they had to find a way to get constant funding. A solution they found was to take 10% of daily staking rewards and use those coins to fund the project (hire devs, launch marketing/PR campaigns, etc.). If you are familiar with the DASH project, they were the first ones to adopt such a strategy and it could be argued that it is one of the reasons they are doing so well right now.</p><h3 id=\"economic-dynamics-of-staking\">Economic Dynamics of Staking</h3><p>Since it has been first implemented, proof-of-stake has been observed to propose a different set of economic dynamics than proof-of-work. The major reason why this is so is that stakers don’t actually need to sell their stakes like miners who need to pay for various expenses (electricity, maintenance, temperature management, etc.).</p><p>In fact, if one was to analyze PoS blockchains, he would notice that most staking nodes actually hoard staking rewards rather than cash them out. Since there is no expense tied to staking, it is actually much more beneficial to re-invest (stake) your new rewards as that increasingly makes it more profitable as time goes by, a concept named compounded interest.</p><p>“Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of compounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100 compounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5% semi-annually over the same time period.” (<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp</a>)</p><p>For example, at a 5% reward rate, a staker having 1,000 PARTs would end up the year with 1,050 PARTs. On the second year, his 1,050 PARTs would increase by 4%, leaving the staker with 1092 PARTs. Another staker decides to sell his stake as he receives them, so on the first year, he would have made 50 PARTs of profits. However, because he decided to sell his stakes as he receives them, his second year of staking would only yield him 40 PARTs (1,000 * 0.04). Comparing these two stakers, the first one made a 92 PARTs profits while the second one made 90 PARTs. Note, however, that this example has been simplified for the sake of this presentation. In reality, staking rewards are paid at every block, not every year, so this “build-up” effect that causes stakers to get more PARTs rewards as they re-invest actually happens more quickly, making it even more profitable than in this example.</p><p>I’ve made a simple Calc file that allows you to easily calculate your staking rewards depending on the number of market listings, the estimated yearly return rate, and your PART balance. It takes compounded interest into consideration. Please follow this link to download and play with it: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>Another interesting economic dynamic proof-of-stake provides is that it generates a coin supply shock on trading markets.</p><p>There are two main reasons for this. The first one, as explained above, is that stakers demonstrably prefer hoarding over spending their rewards, creating much less selling pressure on markets. Generally, this would make the coin’s price higher as the supply is reduced while demand stays unaffected. The second reason is directly related to the potential gains a staker can make by simply leaving his computer open. Some people would rather not risk trading their assets, so getting a solid 5–10% investment return under a year can be very appealing, making the coin more in demand. Taking both these dynamics into consideration, it could be said that proof-of-stake increases demand while reducing supply, which generally makes the coin more valuable.</p><p>One problem with that, though, is that if not enough people want to sell the currency on the markets (and simply hoard it instead), it can create a kind of liquidity crisis where not enough coins are put for sale. This is far from ideal for speculators with large sums of money who wouldn’t want to <strong>accumulate</strong> coins on an illiquid market as making a large order could dramatically increase the coin’s price. It is also not a very good marketplace currency as you want to easily be able to buy it at a relatively stable price. To understand why simply ask yourself if it makes sense to have the price increase by 10% just because you made a large PART order to buy a 10,000 USD car on its market. This is not sustainable, so what would be the best way to have a healthy and profitable balance between supply and demand?</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism-proof-of-stake-combo\">Currency-Agnosticism &#x26; Proof-of-stake Combo</h3><p>I believe Particl already has a working solution implemented to balance its staking dynamics with Shapeshift. Remember how I said the market is currency-agnostic and uses Shapeshift to seamlessly exchange other coins into PARTs? Well, it’s not just the marketplace itself, but the entire Particl platform that is so, making it very easy and tempting to actually diversify your portfolio by shape shifting your rewards into other coins. Even though it can be historically demonstrated that stakers would rather keep their rewards than selling them, a proof-of-stake consensus protocol has never been implemented on a currency-agnostic platform.</p><p>Everybody says it: diversification is the key to a profitable and healthy portfolio and staying in only one currency is actually pretty risky. What an easy Shapeshift withdrawal option provides is the ability to very easily diversify your rewards. That means you could instantly convert PART rewards into available coins, be it BTC, ETH, DGX (100% gold-backed cryptocurrency, likely to be added to Shapeshift soon) or even USDt (USD-backed cryptocurrency). The concept of being able to be rewarded in any currency of your choice is actually quite novel and powerful, so it could be reasonably expected that this function will be used a lot.</p><p>For example, I know that I will personally keep around 50% of my own staking rewards in PARTs and shapeshift the rest into whatever currency I like at a given time. I’m surely not the only one who will use the Shapeshift integration this way…This would make the balance between supply and demand more healthy and has the added benefit of making stakers’ portfolios much more secure through diversification. Just pick a couple of coins you like and increase your bags every day!</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-voting-chain-governance\">Decentralized Voting &#x26; Chain Governance</h3><p>Most cryptocurrencies are designed with full immutability in mind, meaning their state (blockchain data &#x26; code) cannot be modified after it is launched (or spent, in the case of a transaction). However, recent events in crypto have shown us that a fully immutable approach to a blockchain perhaps isn’t optimal. In fact, if you are reading this presentation, chances are that you are aware of both the BTC <strong>scalability debate deadlock</strong> and the past split of the Ethereum chain (ETH &#x26; ETC) caused by a <strong>contentious hardfork.</strong></p><p>In the first case, Bitcoin requires finding a solution to help it scale better in order to allow for more transactions per second. There are two popular solutions to fix scalability, one that requires a change to the coin’s protocol (blocksize increase) and one that doesn’t (Segwit implementation). To make things worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the community (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners. All these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to a middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard. Also, because Segwit only requires miners to signal for it, it could be argued that the actual trading/holding community doesn’t have much weight in this whole debate as they can have only a very minimal impact on the signaling.</p><p>In the second case, Ethereum community was faced with a tough decision last year when their The DAO smart-contract got hacked and somebody was draining all funds from it. They had the choice to either let the attacker get away with all the funds, or make a modification to the “The DAO” contract that would have blocked the attack and refunded everyone. The second option, however, required a hardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum Foundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon Vote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based on the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the mining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in crypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how Bitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not).</p><p>We can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing with critical decisions. First, simply relying on miner signaling probably isn’t entirely fair to the rest of the community who doesn’t mine. It is true that anyone can use his computer to mine on whatever pool they want based on what decision the pool is taking (what is it signaling for), but not anyone has the knowledge or gear to do it, and whether this can rival the mining farm’s massive hashing rates is arguable. Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it also took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork, there were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of it. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted, so perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread fast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how many coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote. While that is not a bad thing in itself, it is relatively easy to game for anyone with deep pockets. An entity with a lot of money could have bought a large sum of coins, put them up for voting, and then dumped them once it’s said and done.</p><p>So with these lessons in mind, the Particl team decided to natively implement a voting system on its blockchain that can be used any time a tough decision needs to be taken by any party. Note, however, that this voting system isn’t only used to upgrade the protocol, it can be used by anybody for any reason. It could even be a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they want to be added to the store, for example. They knew the system had to have a couple of key characteristics to be optimal, namely being as decentralized, cheap and limit abuse/fraud as much as possible. So how did they do it?</p><p>The Particl voting system is based on staking and is absolutely free. People wanting to vote on a particular matter need to first select their desired voting option and then make their wallet enabled for staking (which has the added benefit of further securing the network). Every time they stake a block, that will count as 1 vote. The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to specify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified in terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it harder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly. They need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the network doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it rewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote on stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet integration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to participate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting content (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done off-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning. Once IPFS or similar DSNs are implemented, it would then be trivial to also make the voting content in-wallet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-BMvbHi93DbicQue6FOuGDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A CLI example of a user voting for option 2 on Proposal #5 from block 124 to 2,500</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-MRGH2pEBnZyaDl-CPbWGZA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A staked block’s vote result (a staker voted for option 1 on proposal 10 at block #167)</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-6DVsuZ-OQtnA6M5E6YwdHg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl wallet showing voting results displayed in a GUI widget</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-encrypted-messaging-system\">Decentralized &#x26; Anonymous Encrypted Messaging System</h2><p>“<em>Communication is an essential component of doing business. Modern technology gives us cheap, reliable and effortless methods to communicate with others regardless of physical distance. However, this technology does little to safeguard the content of our messages from the scrutiny of interested observers. We live in an age of constant and ubiquitous surveillance, where it becomes more difficult by the day to retain our privacy. Privacy is paramount when conducting business, the consequences of invasions of privacy can be devastating to both businesses and individuals, whether the attacker is a rival firm, a malicious individual or an overbearing government”. (</em><a href=\"https://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging\"><em>https://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>Particl has its own messaging system, SMSG, used as a DSN to host listings on and <em>“to perform communication between merchant and buyer. All nodes participating in the network store all messages of the past 48 hours, this means anyone in the network could have been the sender or receiver. The benefit of the decentralized topology is that there are no direct ties between the messages and any IP addresses. Nodes must try to decrypt all incoming messages to check if it was destined for them”.</em></p><p>As explained in the Particl whitepaper draft, <em>“A message traveling on the BitMessage network does not include metadata that can reveal who the receiver or sender is. Only the encrypted payload, IV, HMAC and temporary public key are public, the receiver of a message is the only able to decrypt the message and only for them the HMAC will properly verify.” </em>(<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf</a>)</p><p>While there is definitely some area of improvements the team is currently working on, notably concerning dual-key stealth addresses, future and forward secrecy, scalability, blockchain key distribution and RMIDs efficiency, this p2p messaging system offers a safe option for people looking to communicate and host market listings with the highest level of privacy possible.</p><h3 id=\"native-segwit-implementation\">Native Segwit Implementation</h3><p>Another sweet feature of the Particl blockchain is that it has a native implementation of Segwit, which I believe is a first in crypto. One small inconvenience with blockchain projects forking their chain to add Segwit is that witness blocks aren’t compatible with blocks prior to the fork. While this is not a critical problem, it sure makes things smoother and easier to have a fully compatible Segwit implementation.</p><p>Having segregated witness on Particl gives its blockchain a couple of interesting features. Among many of these, some notable ones are the <strong>Lightning Network</strong>, <strong>transaction malleability vulnerability fixes</strong>, and <strong>block capacity/size increase</strong>.<br> <br> Lightning Network is a payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja and now scheduled for implementation on Bitcoin as well as some altcoins. LN gives interesting features to whatever coin decides to implement it such as <strong>reduced transaction fees</strong>, <strong>increased transaction speed</strong>, better privacy, and <strong>atomic swaps.</strong></p><p>As it is becoming more and more likely as time goes by that the Lightning Network will be implemented in various different coins, its atomic swap feature is getting more relevant. Atomic swapping is the ability of an LN-enabled blockchain to be made inter-operable through <strong>multi-signature addresses</strong> and <strong>time-locks</strong> with many other LN-enabled blockchains in order to allow trust-less coin exchange between two parties (i.e. Alice can trade 100 LTC to Bob for 1 BTC in a 100% decentralized and counterparty-free fashion). This could even be used to create decentralized multi-coin payment processors or exchanges, effectively spawning a brand new and potentially breakthrough <strong>LN-focused ecosystem</strong> in which Particl could be part of. It also seems plausible that the Particl platform would eventually leverage this feature to allow trust-less currency exchange on its marketplace as well as other Dapps, effectively replacing Shapeshift with a cheaper and decentralized alternative, even though the team hasn’t made any statement on the matter.</p><h2 id=\"industry-leading-user-friendly-graphical-wallet\">Industry-leading &#x26; User-friendly Graphical Wallet</h2><p>All the aforementioned Particl features wouldn’t be as exciting if they weren’t supported by a user-friendly and eye-appealing wallet. Not everyone wants to use terminal-based wallets and even fewer people know how to. Fortunately, the Particl team has some of the best graphical designer and UI/UX devs in the crypto scene, as evidenced by their previous work on Shadowcash’s Umbra wallet built using HTML5.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-KttFKS_tel6YuhGReMv9kw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Graphical designed of SDC’s Umbra wallet, Particl’s prototype released in 2016</figcaption></figure><p>This time, the team has taken their GUI work to the next level! Started from scratch, the Particl wallet is built using the open-source project Electron (<a href=\"https://electron.atom.io/\">https://electron.atom.io/</a>) and AngularJS (<a href=\"https://angular.io/\">https://angular.io/</a>) as its main framework. The Particl wallet does away with the QtWebKit engine on which is created all the crypto Qt wallets to make it more <strong>secure, beautiful and flexible</strong>. At this stage of adoption, it is very important for a blockchain project eyeing the mainstream to have its platform as easy to use as possible. Indeed, Particl’s end-game is to make almost everything related to crypto work seamlessly in the background while offering users a very intuitive experience not more complicated than using web-based marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, etc. A web portal (a website where one could use the Particl marketplace without even downloading the wallet and blockchain) is even planned for later, though the team is currently focusing on first releasing the market.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-D-85sM7GwLoHE2gNLuhoDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s “Send” page</figcaption></figure><p>Security-wise, Electron offers substantial improvements over QtWebKit because of how rendered processes are sandboxed leveraging Chromium’s rendering engine. “A sandbox, in computer security, is a security mechanism in which a separate, restricted environment is created and in which certain functions are prohibited” (<a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security\">https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security</a>). In Particl’s context, it means that if an attacker was to exploit a vulnerability within a Chromium rendered process, the damage would severely be limited to this very process and could not spread to other processes due to the engine’s sandbox.</p><p>On the aesthetics side, the interface is made much more appealing than the famous Qt engine. Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Angular, it is much more interactive than any crypto wallet currently released and is designed with a “modular” approach to it. Indeed, the wallet supports the use of many widgets which can be selected by the user depending on what information they want to quickly be able to glance at. They display much useful information about the wallet in a neat visual fashion, and users can very easily customize how their wallet looks by adding/removing whatever widget they want. Elements they can display include (but are not limited to) staking data, voting data, transaction history, marketplace data, network data, etc. As they are basically only visual representation of blockchain/p2p data, it is very easy to add more of them. It will be interesting to see what the community comes up with in terms of useful widgets they can code and add to Particl. Also, as the project advances in time and new Particl Dapps are created, using widgets will lead to very different and personalized experiences from person to person depending on what is their main reason to use the Particl wallet (staking investment, shopping, holding, gambling on a Particl Dapp, etc.).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-DQmkHEn_IU0S5ymg4P1oug.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl wallet widgets overview &#x26; responsive capability</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-ukw96KJfPVy6VXrF6Yxuww.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s “Receive” page</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-git6mMXlfrz_Lb-dEi2Sgg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s “Settings” page</figcaption></figure><p>For more screenshots of the Particl wallet, you can either visit this link of GUI progress screenshots (<a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX\">http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX</a>, posted on May 22nd, so may be outdated) or simply go ahead and participate in testnet #4 which is the first iteration of Particl testnet to include a GUI version.</p><h3 id=\"wallet-installer\">Wallet Installer</h3><p>Another useful feature the GUI wallet will have is an installer that automatically pops up the first time a user launches the wallet and offers to set up lots of stuff such as wallet file importation, privacy sliders (a user can choose how much privacy he needs to set up DSNs), tor installation, etc. Again, as the project grows, a lot can be added to the installer to make it even more useful and render the experience as user-friendly and customizable as possible.</p><h2 id=\"future-features\">Future Features</h2><p>Even though Particl will already offer quite an impressive set of features on day 1, the team has lots of goodies planned for the future.</p><p>One of them is a mobile wallet with ALL desktop features enabled, including messaging and marketplace shopping. The only aspect the team is not sure about integrating into its mobile wallet is staking since it has a couple of drawbacks (potentially high number of unstable nodes due to bad phone reception, battery draining, possible security vulnerabilities, etc.).</p><p>Fiat gateways are also high on the list of priorities. While a solid crypto marketplace could find its niche within the crypto world, it would be much more difficult to go mainstream if it didn’t support integrated fiat deposits and withdrawals. In a way, this is already covered through the Shapeshift integration using Tether (USDt), but more options are always appreciated. The team is considering partnerships with fiat gateways like Changelly which allows the use of credit cards as a funding method or using exchange API keys to integrate fiat pairs into the wallet.</p><p>Another future feature of the project is to establish web portals on which people can access some (or all) functions included in the desktop wallet. The end-game here is to allow people to shop on the marketplace using a website and without having to download the wallet and the entire blockchain. This would make it much easier for regular, non-crypto people to use and is one of the things that could greatly help Particl have a shot at becoming mainstream.</p><p>The team is also looking to integrate more DSNs through partnerships (Siacoin, SafeNetwork, IPFS, etc.) and others method of network routing such as i2p. This is of course with the goal to provide users with a vast array of choices to suit their security needs and budget (as DSNs can vary in pricing fees).</p><h2 id=\"competition\">Competition</h2><p>With all that being said, it is now time to look at who are Particl’s competitors. After all, the crypto world is now an extremely competitive space and it could lead to several BETA vs VHS or Blu-ray vs HD DVD situations where many projects would compete in the same sector until one becomes big enough to stomp its competitors out of business. Hopefully for Particl, it has one huge advantage in the fact that it actually competes in several sectors, dramatically increasing its exposure and chances of success. Please note that the following paragraphs will contain a lot of subjective opinions on why I believe Particl is a serious competitor in many industries, so take it with a grain of salt and come up with your own conclusions.</p><h3 id=\"as-a-currency\">As A Currency</h3><p>Particl definitely meets the criteria to be considered a competitor in the payment currency sector of crypto. Not only does it possess all the same features as Bitcoin and other similar currencies, it literally hosts a decentralized marketplace on its wallet on which its native currency is used to trade goods and services. This is a use-case that very few currencies can claim to have, but it doesn’t stop there.</p><p>Particl also directly competes in the field of privacy coins where Monero, Zcash (and similar ZK SNARKS coins) and DASH are furiously battling. Just as in the payment currency sector, Particl doesn’t need to shy away here at all. It does possess a similar (and <strong>arguably</strong> better) implementation of Monero’s privacy tech, RingCT, and even adds Lightning Network + CT on top of it for a very impressive privacy combo (<strong>RingCT + CT + LN combo</strong>). This should be very interesting for a lot of people and projects that wanted to easily add a RingCT coin to their platform (i.e. Jaxx wallet).</p><h3 id=\"as-a-marketplace\">As A Marketplace</h3><p>Another obvious crypto sector in which Particl is a serious competitor is with decentralized marketplaces. This space has a limited number of competitors such as OpenBazaar, Syscoin and Bitify. Personally, as an investor, my subjective opinion is that decentralized marketplaces are going to become a big thing in the years to come. This is why I research these projects a lot, and my conclusion is that Particl has the most potential to be adopted as a market through its user-friendliness and the many features detailed throughout this presentation. Its two main competitors, OpenBazaar and Syscoin, do have some interesting features but I believe they will not outperform Particl in terms of both popularity and investment returns. <br> <br> In the case of OpenBazaar, it is simply not possible to invest in it and while it charges no fee, its user experience is years away from any kind of mass adoption and has a p2p approach I am not too fond of. It also offers poor privacy and security parameters and should not be relied on by vendors looking for the ultimate privacy experience. What I find to be the most annoying thing about OB is that a vendor needs to host his shop on a computer/server and leave it open all the time. Failing that, the listing is put offline and the vendor cannot make any sale. It is possible to host your shop on a third-party server to make it more reliable in terms of uptime, but that is taking the control out of your hands and a security risk as well as going against the decentralization principle of the crypto world. OpenBazaar plans to launch a second version of their marketplace using IPFS which would allegedly eliminate the need to have a computer open at all time, but that does imply that they will need to introduce a fee structure to their platform.</p><p>With Syscoin, there are other problems that I see. The first one is that the user-experience is simply horrible and the wallet itself is not eye-appealing at all. Their solution for this was to create BlockMarket, a more user-friendly but <strong>closed-source</strong> interface interacting with the Syscoin blockchain. While it is definitely better looking than its Syscoin backend, it is still years away from any kind of mass adoption and its look would most likely turn off anyone that is not involved in crypto. What worries me the most about Blockmarket, however, is that it is basically a glorified centralized marketplace. In fact, The Blockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control over what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor listings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform as it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers, making it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also, purely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl because people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch Syscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter automatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order for a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with Bitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also should be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the proof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of great features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings. Lastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very popular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data are stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on DSNs).</p><p>Though it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not. I do believe this kind of industry can and will have enough place for more than one marketplace. After all, we have Etsy, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist and Alibaba all co-existing and sharing the same space, but with each one having its niche features and appeal to different audiences. There is nothing indicating that this could not be the case in the crypto world as well. Here, Particl definitely is the most secure and private solution, and this is what excites me the most as a privacy enthusiast.</p><p>We should also not forget about centralized, well-established marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. These giants sure do have a huge share of the global market and have some really great features decentralized marketplace can probably not even dream of offering (at least for now), but they do have negatives that decentralized solutions can do better. Please refer to the previous “Target Users” section of this presentation, or read my previous article on this very subject by following this link: <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad</a></p><p>I believe that decentralized marketplaces can compete with centralized ones in these aspects:</p><p>- Controversial &#x26; potentially illegal goods &#x26; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &#x26; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &#x26; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><h3 id=\"as-a-dapp-platform\">As A Dapp Platform</h3><p>Even though the competition with Dapp platforms such as Ethereum, Stratis, Lisk or Tezos in not as direct as Particl competition in the marketplace sector, it is still a platform on which more “Dapps” than the marketplace will be built. It is very important to understand that we are not talking about smart-contract Dapps here, but rather hard-coded decentralized applications. To give you an idea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice Dapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was abandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of what kind of Dapps Particl could host. The use of DSNs open up a lot of possibilities, I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended getting decentralized Netflix/Youtube/Music Stores powered by DSNs such as IPFS or Siacoin.</p><p>The main difference with Ethereum in terms of Dapp is that Ethereum is more like an operating system similar to Linux where users are given full liberty to code any smart-contract with its native programming language (Solidity), whereas Particl is more like a WeChat-style application on which apps (not smart-contracts) can be added to. To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer, Particl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day have its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized application they want to have on their Particl wallet. It is worth noting that Particl Dapps are probably going to be much more scalable than smart-contract platforms as they would work using DSNs (SMSG is not immensely scalable, but IPFS, Siacoin or SafeNetwork are).</p><h2 id=\"conclusion-personal-comments\">Conclusion &#x26; Personal Comments</h2><p>For all the reasons and features mentioned during this presentation, I believe Particl is one of the most under-rated and undervalued projects of the crypto space at the moment. Its impressive set of privacy tools, its highly profitable staking reward schedule, and its highly scalable marketplace/Dapp ecosystem makes it extremely likely that Particl will become a popular and widely used crypto-currency in the not-so-distant future. Another thing that I really like about it is that it is building an entire <strong>ecosystem</strong> rather than being a simple “feature coin” (a coin that mostly does ONE thing well). Not only does having a working ecosystem around your coin make it more resilient to being outdated by newer technologies, it also creates a real demand for it rather than just deriving its value from trade speculation. This ecosystem is supported by a 5% (which will most likely turn into 10%) yearly investment return, on which is added market/Dapps/Txs fees and busted escrow funds.</p><p>Let’s crunch some numbers. If one would buy <strong>$25,000 </strong>worth of PARTs at <strong>$25</strong>, it would give him a total of <strong>1,000 PARTs</strong>. If he were to stake his entire balance, he would be guaranteed 5% yearly, paid every day. The actual more likely number would probably be 8–10%, so let’s round it up to 9%. This staker would make around <strong>0.25 PARTs per day</strong> (1,000 x 0.09 / 365 = 0.24657), or about<strong> $6.16</strong>. At the end of a full year, considering no PARTs were spent, he would have an estimated balance of around 1090 PARTs, a 9% increase valued at around<strong> $2,250 profits</strong>. The actual formula to estimate staking profits per day is as follow: Balance x estimated yearly % returns / 365 x PART price</p><p>That amount, however, is assuming that no transaction happens in the marketplace and that no one makes any transaction on the blockchain since no transaction fees are added into the formula. To calculate how many additional PARTs one would from the marketplace fees, it is possible to use this formula:</p><p>(Estimated number of marketplace listings x 0.01 x 0.5) / 100 x (PART balance x 100 / Particl total circulating supply)</p><p>If the marketplace was to host<strong> 50,000 listings</strong>, the staker in the example above would receive an additional <strong>0.3 PART a day</strong>, or<strong> 11.93 PARTs a year</strong>. At <strong>$25 </strong>per coin, that would earn him additional $298.20 per year for a total of <strong>$2,548.20.</strong></p><p>Again, there are some missing numbers that are harder to calculate such as daily transaction fees and busted escrow funds, so it is almost certain that the actual staking profits the staker in this example would make in real life would be bigger. It is also not taking into consideration the future Particl Dapps that will end up generating fees as well, making staking rewards even larger. I really do believe these interesting figure could propel Particl into top 10 cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Please visit this link to download a spreadsheet I’ve made that will help you calculate your staking revenues taking compounding, Particl Foundation donation and market fees into consideration: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>The only major problem I see with the currency itself is that it could eventually have scalability problems similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum during popular ICOs. Yes, the project will soon get Lightning Network once it is ready, but it is likely that it would be mostly useful for micro-transactions rather than ALL types of transactions. Besides, RingCT transactions cannot be processed through LN and are certainly NOT lightweight in terms of what space they use within a block. Even though I have heard from one solid and reliable source that the team does have plans and methods they are exploring that could potentially make its currency scalable similar to DASH’s levels, nothing has been publicly revealed (or even hinted at), so it shouldn’t be taken into consideration until this is publicly discussed. However, if Particl should ever have currency scalability problems, it would actually be a pretty good problem as that means the platform would already be quite popular and its coin very valuable. Note that there is a distinction to make between currency scalability and market scalability, the latter being already successfully dealt with.</p><h2 id=\"additional-resources\">Additional Resources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.io/\">Particl landing page</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl news</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/\">Particl’s GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Whitepaper draft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/particlproject\">Particl Twitter account</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/\">Particl Reddit page</a></li><li><a href=\"http://slack.particl.io/\">Slack channel invite</a></li><li><a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org\">Riot channel</a></li><li><a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Particl-Testnet-Getting-Started-d9yhExvCaW6vCp3qLUwuW\">Latest testnet binaries</a></li><li><a href=\"http://explorer.testnet.particl.io/insight/\">Testnet block explorer</a></li><li>Contact info: <a href=\"mailto:hello@particl.io\">hello@particl.io</a></li></ul><p>This concludes this Particl presentation.

This move was encouraged by the fact that the team wanted to have a more professional branding and were looking for funding so that they could work full-time on it and get it going for good. In fact, they had been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms, that the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to associate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the project also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC blockchain/client and team structure.

It could be argued that as these projects raise tons of money, they lose a certain incentive to work hard on their project as they have already cashed out on their idea. In more traditional VC environments, you would very rarely (if ever) see projects raise hundreds of millions of dollars with only ideas, vague whitepaper, and no working products.

These are very serious threats that are a reality with some of the 100% private coins. ZK SNARKS, for example, a crypto privacy protocol, also has this “hidden inflation problem”. In fact, the chain is initially generated from a set of master keys which could theoretically be used to generate an infinite amount of coins at any time without anyone ever noticing. This is why people say this protocol relies on “trusted setups”; you actually need to trust the party who spawned the chain would successfully destroy the master keys. There is, of course, no way to know for sure whether they didn’t keep copies somewhere or that they were not compromised during any step of the process (software, hardware, network, OS, BIOS, ME chip exploits).

The best example I could find concerning this, in particular, is the case of Monero and Jaxx. Jaxx is a well-known multi-cryptocurrency wallet and they tried to integrate Monero earlier this year. After trying to add the coin to their wallet, they announced they would finally not do it because it was too complicated and they didn’t feel the amount of dev time required for this project would be worth it.

Fully-anonymous currencies can sometimes hinder one’s ability to effectively keep track of financial records and transactions.

There’s also a lot of scenarios where one would need to go back several months into the past to see specific transaction details.

By making the public token the default coin, this ensures that only users seeking privacy options will use the privacy token, while the public users (which will probably end up being the majority of Particl users if the platform becomes mainstream) default to the public token.

As a matter of fact, if the market’s escrow system worked using the public token, it would be trivial for determined attackers to detect patterns in the public escrow contracts and match them to potential users.

For example, RingCT being mandatory and by default on all transactions makes it impossible to make a basic human mistake (they do happen), but it also makes Monero a more expensive currency to use and a blockchain less likely to be able to support a huge influx of users (as transactions are heavy and would bloat the blockchain faster).

To make things worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the community (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners. All these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to a middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard.

The second option, however, required a hardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum Foundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon Vote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based on the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the mining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in crypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how Bitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing with critical decisions.

Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it also took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork, there were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of it. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted, so perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread fast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how many coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote.

It could even be a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they want to be added to the store, for example.

The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to specify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified in terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it harder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly. They need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the network doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it rewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote on stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet integration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to participate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting content (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done off-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning.

This is why I research these projects a lot, and my conclusion is that Particl has the most potential to be adopted as a market through its user-friendliness and the many features detailed throughout this presentation.

What I find to be the most annoying thing about OB is that a vendor needs to host his shop on a computer/server and leave it open all the time. Failing that, the listing is put offline and the vendor cannot make any sale. It is possible to host your shop on a third-party server to make it more reliable in terms of uptime, but that is taking the control out of your hands and a security risk as well as going against the decentralization principle of the crypto world.

While it is definitely better looking than its Syscoin backend, it is still years away from any kind of mass adoption and its look would most likely turn off anyone that is not involved in crypto. What worries me the most about Blockmarket, however, is that it is basically a glorified centralized marketplace. In fact, The Blockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control over what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor listings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform as it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers, making it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also, purely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl because people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch Syscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter automatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order for a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with Bitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also should be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the proof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of great features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings. Lastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very popular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data are stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on DSNs)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Though it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not.

To give you an idea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice Dapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was abandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of what kind of Dapps Particl could host.

To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer, Particl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day have its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized application they want to have on their Particl wallet.

In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT transactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation, RingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable capabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms have even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as exemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we have previously explored in depth <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Moreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences, tracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without consent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an unsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a scenario we’ve also previously discussed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>To safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl Marketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or distribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata. All marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such as buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through end-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">a peer-to-peer data and messaging platform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes</a>.</p><p>This privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data ownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks, exploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>While various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are still needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that eliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries within the eCommerce domain.</p><p>However, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for cryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising their safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious strangers.</p><p>As we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of cryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”).

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
