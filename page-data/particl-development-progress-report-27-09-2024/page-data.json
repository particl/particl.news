the week ends, let's take a moment to look back at what we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nMarketplace Moderation Update ?\nThis week, we've conducted more extensive testing of the AI-based moderation\nscript, and we're pleased to report that it's performing exactly as intended\nwith the marketplace. We've also successfully integrated the majority of\nadditional features designed to optimize its user-friendliness.\n\nCurrently, we require a bit more time to evaluate the script's performance\nacross a broader range of test listings. Our goal is to cover as many edge cases\nas possible to ensure robustness.\n\nWe're nearing the stage where we'll be ready to publish a detailed blog post\nexplaining the script's functionality, along with releasing its code.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCodebase ?\nWe've pushed a improvements and bug fixes to the BasicSwap codebase. While these\nchanges are not yet available from the master branch, you can access them by\nbuilding from the dev branch (see here\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/]).\n\n * Updated DASH's version and added backwards compatibility (you can now update\n   your DASH node to the latest version)\n * Refactored seed generation code\n * Refactored basicswap_prepare script\n * Improved daemon management when user already has a certain coin's node set up\n   prior to installing BasicSwap\n * XMR core download automatically resumes if interrupted or fails\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe're finishing up the next batch of GUI updates, fixing a few bugs we've\nencountered, and plan on pushing them live in the next few days. \n\n * Done: Auto refresh (10min) of the chart + coin prices, with enable/disable\n   option.\n * Done: New shutdown modal, featuring a warning message if a swap is in\n   progress\n * Done: Added filter on chart for 30 days / 1 week / 1 day chart.\n * Done: Better offer pagination system\n * Done: User-selectable default coin display on the chart, with Bitcoin as the\n   default if no choice is made\n * Done: Display last refresh time chart.\n * Done: Fixed rate/percentage in offer(s) table.\n * Done: Dynamic network offers table (manually refreshing the page not required\n   anymore)\n * Wrapping up: Implementation of a Tor-compatible API for prices/rates across\n   all templates when Tor is enabled by the user\n * WIP: Adding alert messages when a coin core needs to be upgrade or when a new\n   version of BasicSwap is available (global notification + notification in the\n   wallets page).\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDr. Kap on MoneroTalk's Show ?️\nEarlier this week, Dr. Kap was invited to discuss BasicSwap DEX on MoneroTalk\nahead of the team's attendance at this year's Monerotopia conference.\n\nIf you're in or around Mexico City, make sure to stop by the event and come meet\nthe team!

These developments and their\nrelevance for the project and its continuation will be expanded further down\nthis blog post.\n\nHere are some highlights of our achievements since the last funding cycle:\n\n * Particl added to MEXC (PART/USDT)\n   [https://particl.news/part-usdt-listed-on-mexc/]\n * Large number of updates to BasicSwap's codebase and GUI\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/master/]\n * Particl and BasicSwap join the PFS\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-joins-pfs/]\n * BasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows\n   [https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases/]\n * Talks at Monerokon (2023\n   [https://particl.news/monerokon-2023-presentation-kewde/] and 2024\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-at-monerokon-2024/])\n * Litecoin MWEB balances added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * BasicSwap on stage at the 2024 Litecoin Summit\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-to-present-at-litecoin-summit-2024/]\n * Decred added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/decred-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * Wownero added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/wownero-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\nOngoing Initiatives and Current Priorities\nEmbracing New Opportunities with BasicSwap\nWhile we recently encountered challenges in the development of Particl\nMarketplace, notably in terms of developer availability, these obstacles have\nled us to devote more time and effort towards BasicSwap. This strategic pivot\nhas allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a\nlevel of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and\necosystem revenue.\n\nWith this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving\nthe DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow\nBasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party\napplications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These\nefforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and\nutility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent\nPART price fluctuations.\n\nInnovative Funding Strategies\nThe recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've\nalso sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.\n\nIndeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize\nBasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community,\nwithout introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX\n(decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).\n\nOur immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for\nBasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART\ndonations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various\nstrategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning,\nexternal revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar\nmechanisms.\n\nIn other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its\ncontributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable\nenvironment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors,\nand the project as a whole.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the\nBasicSwap protocol free and open. Our monetization efforts are solely targeted\nat third-party integrations, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both\nthe community and our partners.\n\nDiversifying Funding Sources\nWe're also making strides in securing non-PART donations from communities that\nshare our vision and/or want to be integrated into BasicSwap.\n\nFor instance, one of our beloved community contributors, Ofrnxmr, has recently\nsubmitted a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/ofrnxmr_basicswap.html] to the Monero\ncommunity that got funded, and we've also received a donation\n[https://proposals.decred.org/record/0757fea] from the Decred community\nfollowing our successful integration of their coin into BasicSwap.\n\nThese initiatives are part of our broader strategy to achieve full\nself-sustainability and reduce — or, in the best of cases, completely eliminate\n— our reliance on the network treasury over time while improving our products\nfor the benefit of all.\n\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThese upcoming changes are the reason we are proposing a shorter team funding\ncycle this time around.\n\nIndeed, this proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] seeks a\nmonthly allocation of 35,250 PART from the Treasury Fund for a 6-month period.\nThis funding will support the Particl team and fuel our operations as we work\ntowards our goals of integration and self-sustainability.\n\nWe've opted for a 6-month funding request in order to provide stability for our\ncurrent projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while allowing\nflexibility for potential external funding opportunities and team expansion. \nThis timeframe also gives our community the chance to discuss and propose\nmodifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.\n\nFund Allocation\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to support the\necosystem and its dApps.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nAcknowledging Community Discussions on Treasury and Emission\nWe're aware of the ongoing community discussions regarding potential changes to\nthe treasury system, its parameters, and/or the blockchain's coin emission rate.\nThese conversations are crucial for the long-term sustainability and health of\nthe Particl ecosystem, and we strongly encourage their continuation.\n\nOur decision to request funding for a shorter 6-month period, as opposed to a\n12-month period as was the case with previous proposals, aligns directly with\nthese discussions. It provides the flexibility needed to pursue our new funding\nstrategy and adapt to any potential changes that may arise from community-driven\nproposals. We believe that this shorter claim period strikes a healthy balance\nbetween ensuring the continued, uninterrupted development of Particl and\nremaining responsive to the evolving needs and decisions of the community.\n\nHow to Vote\nWe encourage all stakeholders to participate in this crucial decision-making\nprocess. To cast your vote on proposal #24\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24], we recommend using the\npartyman cold staking application to register your vote on the blockchain.\n\nYou have three options:\n\n * Abstain (0)\n * Vote in favor (1)\n * Vote against (2)\n\nEvery vote counts! Higher participation ensures a broader consensus and a\nhealthier decision-making process for our entire community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running its latest version. To do so, \nrun git pull from inside your partyman folder, and then type the ./partyman\nupdate command from that same partyman folder.\nLooking Ahead: A Bright Future for Particl\nThe challenges we've faced recently have only strengthened our resolve and led\nus towards innovative solutions that will benefit our entire ecosystem.\n\nOur focus on BasicSwap integration, coupled with our efforts to diversify\nfunding and optimize our economic model, sets the stage for a resurgence of\nParticl and a renewed growth, much like the phoenix reborn from its ashes. As we\nwork on this new approach, we are confident in its potential to create\nself-sustaining ecosystem revenue that not only weathers market fluctuations,\nbut even thrives in the face of them.\n\nThat is why we invite you to join us in supporting this new funding request.\nYour participation in the voting process, your feedback, and your continued\nsupport are the driving forces behind Particl's success and the reason we keep\ndoing what we do.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support and commitment to the Particl project.

This strategic pivot has allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a level of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and ecosystem revenue.</p><p>With this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving the DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow BasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party applications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These efforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and utility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent PART price fluctuations.</p><h3 id=\"innovative-funding-strategies\"><strong>Innovative Funding Strategies</strong></h3><p>The recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've also sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.</p><p>Indeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize BasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community, without introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX (decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).</p><p>Our immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for BasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART donations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various strategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning, external revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar mechanisms.</p><p>In other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its contributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable environment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors, and the project as a whole.</p><p><strong>It's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the BasicSwap protocol free and open. Our monetization efforts are solely targeted at third-party integrations, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both the community and our partners.</strong></p><h3 id=\"diversifying-funding-sources\"><strong>Diversifying Funding Sources</strong></h3><p>We're also making strides in securing non-PART donations from communities that share our vision and/or want to be integrated into BasicSwap.</p><p>For instance, one of our beloved community contributors, Ofrnxmr, has recently submitted a <a href=\"https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/ofrnxmr_basicswap.html\">CCS proposal</a> to the Monero community that got funded, and we've also <a href=\"https://proposals.decred.org/record/0757fea\">received a donation</a> from the Decred community following our successful integration of their coin into BasicSwap.</p><p>These initiatives are part of our broader strategy to achieve full self-sustainability and reduce — or, in the best of cases, completely eliminate — our reliance on the network treasury over time while improving our products for the benefit of all.</p><h2 id=\"the-funding-request-in-detail\"><strong>The Funding Request in Detail</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>These upcoming changes are the reason we are proposing a shorter team funding cycle this time around.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24\">this proposal</a> seeks a monthly allocation of <strong>35,250 PART from the Treasury Fund for a 6-month period</strong>. This funding will support the Particl team and fuel our operations as we work towards our goals of integration and self-sustainability.</p><p>We've opted for a 6-month funding request in order to provide stability for our current projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while allowing flexibility for potential external funding opportunities and team expansion. <strong>This timeframe also gives our community the chance to discuss and propose modifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.</strong></p><h3 id=\"fund-allocation\"><strong>Fund Allocation</strong></h3><p>Given the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily allocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as cover various operational expenses.</p><p>Should the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be accumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of marketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to support the ecosystem and its dApps.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"acknowledging-community-discussions-on-treasury-and-emission\"><strong>Acknowledging Community Discussions on Treasury and Emission</strong></h3><p>We're aware of the ongoing community discussions regarding potential changes to the treasury system, its parameters, and/or the blockchain's coin emission rate. These conversations are crucial for the long-term sustainability and health of the Particl ecosystem, and we strongly encourage their continuation.</p><p>Our decision to request funding for a shorter 6-month period, as opposed to a 12-month period as was the case with previous proposals, aligns directly with these discussions. It provides the flexibility needed to pursue our new funding strategy and adapt to any potential changes that may arise from community-driven proposals.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
