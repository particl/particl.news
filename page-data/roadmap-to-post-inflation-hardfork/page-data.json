The hardfork fixed the issue and temporarily froze anon\nand blind outputs so that exploited ones couldn’t be used anymore.\n\nToday’s post will provide all the details on the way forward post-bug, including\nthe roadmap to closure, the process of re-enabling legitimate outputs,\nestimates, how to help the team out, and more.\n\nThis is a rather important blog post so make sure you read it carefully.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content\n * Current Figures and Estimations\n * How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\n * Supply and Staking Implications\n   [/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/supply-and-staking-implications]\n * The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\n * Help the Team Gather More Information\n * AMA for Any Remaining Questions\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Figures and Estimations\nAt this moment, it is confirmed that 768,767 PART coins have been successfully\nexploited and transferred back to public balances\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. This number can be\nconfirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting\nfigure with the expected supply.\n\nFor clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held\nin public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of\ncoins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected\nsupply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all\nthe coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value\nwhen entering the gettxoutsetinfo command.\n\nBut the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing\nto Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total\nnumber of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to\nit. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into\naccount public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to\nbe sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of\nexploited coins up as it happens.\n\nIn this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have\nbeen already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be\nconfirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs.\nThis brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 +\n768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to\nbe in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at\n11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).\n\nOf course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of\nre-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure\nshouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.\n\nHow to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\nOn the March 2021 Project Update\n[https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], we mentioned two different\ntechniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins.\nSince then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved\nthe solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put\nonto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows\ncarefully.\n\nLow Pass Filter\nThe easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass\nfilter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that\nwill trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most\nmarketplace-related anon and blind outputs.\n\nThis low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low\nnumber of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass\nfilter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or\nless will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low\npass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors\nbefore the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.\n\nThis is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs\nqualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next\nhardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your\nParticl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.\n\nIf you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to\nfirst transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new\npost-fork anon address.\n\nManual Claim Process\nIf you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go\nthrough a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the \nMarch 2021 Project Update [https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], the\nteam has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with\na more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the\nprocess.\n\nInitially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to\nre-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power\nover the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the\ncommunity.\n\nWe now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process\nthese claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process,\nthe Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking\nfor the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.\n\nIf approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure\nchannel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client.\nThis script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step\nuntil it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump\nthe privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by\nrecreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary.\nAdditional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully\nvalidate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in\nthe great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected\ndata. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an\ninstant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.\n\nIf a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his\ncase to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated\nby the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a\nseparate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with\nanother hardfork later on in the future.\n\nThis improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce\nthe burden put on the user, and increase privacy.\n\n> Note: Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a\nseparate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.\nSupply and Staking Implications\nBecause this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the\ncurrent expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix\nthat issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different\nfactors.\n\n 1. On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum\n    of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total\n    of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be\n    raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.\n 2. The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which\n    is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has\n    already been confirmed in the initial vulnerability disclosure\n    [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. That sums up to a\n    total of 768,767 coins.\n 3. The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins\n    are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are\n    re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same\n    amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and\n    1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute\n    maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass\n    filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART\n    coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the\n    filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and\n    small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs\n    also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because\n    they have already been flagged as fraudulent.\n\nDue to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl\nblockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.\n\nThe Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\nThe coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and\nallow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes\nlive, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled\nand both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl\nV3 to go live on mainnet.\n\nThere are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go\nlive. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then. Each item is\nmore or less in chronological order.\n\nFinalize and Test the Tracer Script\nParticl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on the “tracer script” which,\nwhen executed in a Particl client, will automatically validate the legitimacy of\nmany frozen outputs by tracing anon outputs back to public ones.\n\nThe script is currently being finalized and incrementally tested with outputs\nthat have already been provided to the team by a couple of community members.\n\nVote to Nominate the Team as Claim Managers\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the team will soon be pushing a proposal\nto the CCS system to be nominated as managers of the claim process. If approved\nby the community, users will be able to submit their proof directly to the team\ninstead of pushing independent proposals. If the team rejects a claim, the user\nwill still be able to plead his case to the community by making a CCS proposal\nof his own.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice for discussion and to give enough time for people to become aware of\nit.\nProcess Manual Claims and Compile the Whitelist\nAfter the team’s proposal is approved, claims will need to be collected and\nvalidated. All claims that get approved will be added to a whitelist which will\nautomatically re-enable validated outputs once the next hardfork goes live.\n\nVote On the New Treasury Model and Implement It\nAs a final item before the next hardfork will go live, the team will push a\nsecond proposal to activate the new treasury model. This new treasury model will\nbring funding to the team and allow the Particl project to be back at full\nforce.\n\nIf approved, the team will include the changes (which are relatively simple to\ninclude all things considered) into the code and activate the new treasury model\nwith the next hardfork.\n\nExpect a standalone blog post about this new proposed treasury model on Particl\nNews within the next few days.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice. The proposal will be published after the first week of the voting\nperiod to nominate the team as claim managers so that both voting periods can be\ncompleted as quickly as possible for the hardfork to go through.\nAt this time, we are looking for the hardfork to go live in around 6 weeks.\nThat’s the time required for both votes to go through and for everything to be\nready. If they are both approved, then the hardfork will re-enable frozen\noutputs and activate the new treasury model at the same time. The team also\nhopes that it can release the Particl V3 mainnet release simultaneously,\nalthough that remains to be seen. As always, this is an estimate based on the\ninformation currently available. We will communicate to the community if any\ndelay occurs.\n\nHelp the Team Gather More Information\n> UPDATE: You can now more easily collect your outputs simply by downloading and\ninstalling Particl Desktop 2.3.6\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6]. In this\nclient, you'll find a \"printer\" icon at the top right of your screen with a\nsimple button to automate steps 1 to 6 in the following section.\nTo improve the tracer script and flag as many exploited outputs as possible, the\nteam is looking to gather as much information as it can. To help the team out on\nthat quest, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has put together a series of\ncommands you can enter in any of your wallets that has ever had an anon/blind\nbalance or transaction.\n\n1- Download the latest pre-release of Particl Core (Qt) here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2].\n\nRelease 0.19.2.6 Alpha 2 · tecnovert/particl-coreTo downgrade to a previous\nrelease, run debugwallet {\\“downgrade_wallets\\”:true} from the later\nrelease.Hashes668c254e9a0e7d4521d53868ece2691a520f6b2c86976aebdbb6e3b2a5d743ee\nparticl-0.19.2.6-aa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2]2- Load all your wallets that have or have had anon transactions and/or frozen\noutputs.\n\n3- Open the debug console located in the \"Window\" tab at the top of the wallet.\n\n4- Don't forget to switch your debug console window to the wallet with anon\ntransactions/outputs.

You’ll be able to ask any questions related to it and\non how the team will proceed. This thread will then double up as an FAQ thread\nfor people with similar questions and be linked directly into the CCS proposal.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and patience throughout this delicate situation.

This number can be confirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting figure with the expected supply.</p><p>For clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held in public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of coins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected supply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all the coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value when entering the <code class=\"language-text\">gettxoutsetinfo</code> command.</p><p>But the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing to Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total number of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to it. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into account public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to be sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of exploited coins up as it happens.</p><p>In this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have been already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be confirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs. This brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 + 768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to be in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at 11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).</p><p>Of course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of re-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure shouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-reactivate-legitimate-outputs\">How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs</h1><p>On the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, we mentioned two different techniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins. Since then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved the solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put onto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows carefully.</p><h3 id=\"low-pass-filter\">Low Pass Filter</h3><p>The easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass filter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that will trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most marketplace-related anon and blind outputs.</p><p>This low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low number of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass filter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or less will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low pass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors before the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.</p><p>This is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs qualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next hardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your Particl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.</p><p>If you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to first transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new post-fork anon address.</p><h3 id=\"manual-claim-process\">Manual Claim Process</h3><p>If you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go through a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, the team has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with a more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the process.</p><p>Initially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to re-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power over the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the community.</p><p>We now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process these claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process, the Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking for the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.</p><p>If approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure channel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client. This script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step until it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump the privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by recreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary. Additional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully validate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in the great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected data. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an instant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.</p><p>If a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his case to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated by the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a separate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with another hardfork later on in the future.</p><p>This improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce the burden put on the user, and increase privacy.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a separate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"supply-and-staking-implications\">Supply and Staking Implications</h1><p>Because this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the current expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix that issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different factors.</p><ol><li>On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.</li><li>The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has already been confirmed in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/\"><strong>initial vulnerability disclosure</strong></a>. That sums up to a total of 768,767 coins.</li><li>The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and 1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because they have already been flagged as fraudulent.</li></ol><p>Due to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl blockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.</p><h1 id=\"the-roadmap-to-the-coming-hardfork\">The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork</h1><p>The coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and allow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes live, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled and both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl V3 to go live on mainnet.</p><p>There are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go live. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then.

financially and legally\nsupported by a Swiss non-profit Foundation; the Particl Foundation. This legal\nentity has served the purpose of funding the development and management of\nParticl as well as supporting the project legally using funds that it raised\nfrom the community in 2017.\n\nAs of November 2020, after slightly more than three years, the Particl\nFoundation has run out of the funds it raised from community donations and as\nsuch, has initiated its shutdown process. A mandatory closure audit is currently\nunderway.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team has since then voluntarily supported the project\nsince no funds are available anymore to pay for salaries, expenses, and fund\ndevelopment and initiatives.\n\nWith today's fast-paced and rapidly evolving blockchain industry, any serious\nproject needs to have enough funding to support its ecosystem, promote its\nproduct(s), and grow its community. Equally important is the necessity to have\nlegal representation so that the project can effectively and safely interact\nwith other parties, manage funds, and own assets (i.e., servers). Without any of\nthis, projects expose themselves to being overrun by competitors who don’t have\nthe same financial struggles.\n\nTo address this critical issue, the Particl team has consulted with a few\nadvisors and community leaders and put together a proposal for a new \ndecentralized treasury model that, if approved by the Particl community, could \nbring enough funding to self-sustain the project at current prices, boost\ncommunity resources, and provide a brand new legal entity to support the project\n.\n\nThis blog post will explain, in full detail, every aspect of the new\ndecentralized treasury model; how it works, its benefits and its parameters.\nThis is a first step aimed at getting you familiarized with the proposed idea.\n\nThen, in a separate blog post that will be published in the next few days on\nParticl News, we will publish a full breakdown of how the Particl team intends\nto claim and use those funds, restructure the project, stimulate the community\nand bring the Particl ecosystem to the next level in all aspects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Proposal in Short\n * Proposal Approval and Treasury Governance\n * Funding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\n * Additional Benefits\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposal in Short\nThis decentralized treasury model proposal, which is closely modelled after that\nof successful projects such as Siacoin and Decred, aims at firing up and\nexpanding Particl into a stronger-than-ever ecosystem by generating more PART\nthat can be put to use to the benefit of the project. The Particl team would\nthen claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or\nbi-annually.\n\nTo preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the\nintroduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community\nthrough an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to\ncome. If approved, the modifications necessary to activate the new treasury\nmodel will be included in the upcoming hardfork that re-enables RingCT and CT\ntransactions.\n\nSelf-Sustainability—The Numbers in Detail\n * Circulating supply post-hardfork (estimate): ~11,750,000 PART\n * Proposed yearly inflation rate: 8%\n * Proposed treasury block rewards: 50%\n * Proposed total yearly staking rate (APR for stakers): 4%\n * Proposed yearly treasury rewards (estimates): 470,000 PART\n * Monthly treasury rewards (averaged from estimates): 39,166 PART\n\n> Note: If the proposal is approed, the current 10% “development staking reward”\nis going to be abolished in profit of the new decentralized treasury model.\nIn summary, the proposal for this new decentralized treasury model suggests\nincreasing the yearly inflation rate from 2% to 8% for two years and then \ndecreasing it by 1% every two years until it reaches 6% and stays at that level.\nEvery time the network stakes a block, 50% of the block rewards would then be\nredistributed to stakers and 50% into the Treasury Fund to fund, support,\npromote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating\nsupply every year.\n\nThis brings the yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%. Because\nAPY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY\nalways ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, if 50% of all\nthe PART coins are staking on the network, the staking APY goes from 4% to\naround 8% yearly.\n\nThis proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it\nprovides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core\nteam, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at\ncurrent (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to\nexpand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More\ndetails on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim\nand use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few\ndays on Particl News.\n\nDuring its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an average of 39,166 PART\nevery month. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to\nsustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next\nlevel. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.\n\nOf course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in\nthe trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable\nin fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs,\nstimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the\nentire ecosystem even more. For this reason, the Treasury Fund has exponential\ngrowth potential, but it's also important to note that a reduction in the price\nof PART can also have an adverse effect.\n\nProposal Approval and Treasury Governance\nThe Particl team has long been looking to decentralize the project further and\nput more power into the hands of the community. That’s the true spirit of\nblockchain technology, after all, and this is precisely what this new\ndecentralized treasury model achieves.\n\nAs such, this new treasury model is being suggested as a CCS proposal and\nrequires community approval to be set in motion. If the vote passes and the\nproposal is approved, the new treasury model will be put in place in the\nupcoming hardfork.\n\nAs for the governance of the Treasury Fund itself, you, the community, will have\nthe final say over it. To claim funds from it, the Particl team will publish CCS\nproposals every quarter or on a bi-annual basis, depending on a few factors at\nthe time the proposals are published. These proposals will detail how the funds\nare intended to be used, the objectives for the claim period, and what to expect\nin terms of deliverables.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the Particl team will publish shortly a\nseparate blog post exclusively focused on explaining how it will be restructured\nin light of this new decentralized governance (including a brand new legal\nentity), how it intends to claim and use funds moving forward, as well as its\nobjectives and deliverables.\n\nCommunity Governance and On-Chain Voting\nTo approve CCS proposals and claims of funds, the community will be invited to\nvote through the on-chain voting mechanism built into Particl Core. This voting\nsystem uses staking weight, meaning the number of coins being staked, as voting\ntickets. The more coins you stake on the Particl network, the greater your voice\nin these voting events.\n\nIt is possible to vote using clients such as Particl CLI, Particl Desktop, and\nParticl-Qt, but the best way to do it is through Particl’s cold staking\napplication Partyman. To facilitate the process of voting, a GUI integration has\nbeen added to the CCS, effectively tying proposals to on-chain voting events.\n\nMore information about the on-chain voting system, including the consensus and\nquorum requirements, will also be published in a separate blog post focused on\nthe on-chain voting scheduled for in a few days on Particl News.\n\nFunding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\nThe implementation of the treasury model, combined with the on-chain voting\nsystem integration into the CCS, will also enable brand-new opportunities at the\ncommunity level. Every month, a number of PART coins coming from the\ndecentralized treasury fund will be sent into a community-governed fund.\n\nThis Community Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM], which\nalready contains ~25,818 PART coins as a result of unclaimed PART during the\ncoin swap event in 2017, will be made available to the community to be used to\nfund CCS initiatives. For an initiative to be funded by the Community Fund, it\nneeds to first go through a voting process, reach a voting quorum (minimum\nnumber of coins having voted), and approval rate. If that is achieved, then the\nproposal is officially approved by the community. According to the milestone\nschedule, the correct number of coins will be sent from the Community Fund to\nthe initiative’s custodian.\n\nAdditional Benefits\nWhile this blog post simply exclusively intends on explaining the decentralized\ntreasury model proposal, here are some of the benefits it will provide to the\nproject if approved. Of course, much more information on that end will be\npublished in the blog post that will explain how the team intends on using those\nfunds coming in just a few days.\n\n * Complete restructuring of the team’s internal processes, management,\n   leadership, and communications (internal and external).\n * Team expansion as price and market situation permits.\n * More active and rapid development as well as a more constant release\n   schedule.\n * More regular, streamlined, and transparent communication/updates.\n * More active, engaged, and blooming community and ecosystem.\n * More focus on deliverables other than Particl Core, the marketplace, and\n   Particl Desktop.\n * Renewed efforts in getting listed on more prominent exchanges.\n * More financial and human resources to market Particl’s products (i.e. PART\n   coin, Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, etc.)\n * Many more promotional and user acquisition initiatives.\n * And more…\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the power\nto significantly change things around and give the project the spark it needs to\nget the exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce behind it that it\ndeserves.\n\nAs we finally move ahead with a lot of what's been in the works for the last\nweeks, keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS this week and the next one.\nWe will start publishing lots of new content including follow-up blog posts and\nthe CCS proposals. We invite you to take part in the discussion related to these\nproposals in their respective comment section on the CCS as they get published.\n\nLet’s get this proposal approved, and let’s take Particl to a whole new level!\n\n> The Particl team\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The Particl team would then claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or bi-annually.</p><p>To preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the introduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community through an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to come. If approved, the modifications necessary to activate the new treasury model will be included in the upcoming hardfork that re-enables RingCT and CT transactions.</p><h3 id=\"self-sustainability-the-numbers-in-detail\"><strong>Self-Sustainability—The Numbers in Detail</strong></h3><ul><li>Circulating supply post-hardfork (estimate): ~<strong>11,750,000 PART</strong></li><li>Proposed yearly inflation rate:<strong> 8%</strong></li><li>Proposed treasury block rewards: <strong>50%</strong></li><li>Proposed total yearly staking rate (APR for stakers):<strong> 4%</strong></li><li>Proposed yearly treasury rewards (estimates): <strong>470,000 PART</strong></li><li>Monthly treasury rewards (averaged from estimates): <strong>39,166 PART</strong></li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> If the proposal is approed, the current 10% “development staking reward” is going to be abolished in profit of the new decentralized treasury model.</em></blockquote><p>In summary, the proposal for this new decentralized treasury model suggests increasing the yearly inflation rate from <strong>2% to 8%</strong> for two years and then <strong>decreasing it by 1% every two years</strong> until it reaches <strong>6% and stays at that level</strong>. Every time the network stakes a block,<strong> 50% of the block rewards</strong> would then be redistributed to stakers and <strong>50% into the Treasury Fund</strong> to fund, support, promote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating supply every year.</p><p>This brings the <strong>yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%</strong>. Because APY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY always ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, <strong>if 50%</strong> of all the PART coins are staking on the network, the <strong>staking</strong> <strong>APY goes from 4% to around 8% yearly</strong>.</p><p>This proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it provides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core team, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at current (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to expand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More details on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim and use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few days on Particl News.</p><p>During its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an <strong>average of 39,166 PART every month</strong>. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to sustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next level. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.</p><p>Of course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in the trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable in fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs, stimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the entire ecosystem even more. For this reason, the Treasury Fund has exponential growth potential, but it's also important to note that a reduction in the price of PART can also have an adverse effect.</p><h1 id=\"proposal-approval-and-treasury-governance\"><strong>Proposal Approval and Treasury Governance</strong></h1><p>The Particl team has long been looking to decentralize the project further and put more power into the hands of the community. That’s the true spirit of blockchain technology, after all, and this is precisely what this new decentralized treasury model achieves.</p><p>As such, this new treasury model is being suggested as a CCS proposal and requires community approval to be set in motion. If the vote passes and the proposal is approved, the new treasury model will be put in place in the upcoming hardfork.</p><p>As for the governance of the Treasury Fund itself, you, the community, will have the final say over it. To claim funds from it, the Particl team will publish CCS proposals every quarter or on a bi-annual basis, depending on a few factors at the time the proposals are published. These proposals will detail how the funds are intended to be used, the objectives for the claim period, and what to expect in terms of deliverables.</p><p>As mentioned earlier in this blog post, the Particl team will publish shortly a separate blog post exclusively focused on explaining how it will be restructured in light of this new decentralized governance (including a brand new legal entity), how it intends to claim and use funds moving forward, as well as its objectives and deliverables.</p><h3 id=\"community-governance-and-on-chain-voting\"><strong>Community Governance and On-Chain Voting</strong></h3><p>To approve CCS proposals and claims of funds, the community will be invited to vote through the on-chain voting mechanism built into Particl Core. <strong>This voting system uses staking weight</strong>, meaning the number of coins being staked, as voting tickets. The more coins you stake on the Particl network, the greater your voice in these voting events.</p><p>It is possible to vote using clients such as Particl CLI, Particl Desktop, and Particl-Qt, but the best way to do it is through Particl’s cold staking application Partyman. To facilitate the process of voting,<strong> a GUI integration has been added to the CCS</strong>, effectively tying proposals to on-chain voting events.</p><p>More information about the on-chain voting system, including the consensus and quorum requirements, will also be published in a separate blog post focused on the on-chain voting scheduled for in a few days on Particl News.</p><h2 id=\"funding-ccs-initiatives-with-a-community-fund\">Funding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund</h2><p>The implementation of the treasury model, combined with the on-chain voting system integration into the CCS, will also enable brand-new opportunities at the community level. <strong>Every month, a number of PART coins coming from the decentralized treasury fund will be sent into a community-governed fund.</strong></p><p>This <strong><a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\">Community Fund</a></strong>, which already contains <strong>~25,818 PART</strong> coins as a result of unclaimed PART during the coin swap event in 2017, will be made available to the community to be used to fund CCS initiatives. For an initiative to be funded by the Community Fund, it needs to first go through a voting process, reach a voting quorum (minimum number of coins having voted), and approval rate. If that is achieved, then the proposal is officially approved by the community. According to the milestone schedule, the correct number of coins will be sent from the Community Fund to the initiative’s custodian.</p><h1 id=\"additional-benefits\"><strong>Additional Benefits</strong></h1><p>While this blog post simply exclusively intends on explaining the decentralized treasury model proposal, here are some of the benefits it will provide to the project if approved. Of course, much more information on that end will be published in the blog post that will explain how the team intends on using those funds coming in just a few days.</p><ul><li><strong>Complete restructuring</strong> of the team’s internal processes, management, leadership, and communications (internal and external).</li><li><strong>Team expansion</strong> as price and market situation permits.</li><li><strong>More active and rapid development</strong> as well as a more constant release schedule.</li><li>More regular, streamlined, and <strong>transparent communication/updates</strong>.</li><li>More active, engaged, and blooming community and ecosystem.</li><li>More focus on deliverables other than Particl Core, the marketplace, and Particl Desktop.</li><li>Renewed efforts in getting listed on more <strong>prominent exchanges</strong>.</li><li>More financial and human resources to <strong>market Particl’s products</strong> (i.e. PART coin, Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, etc.)</li><li>Many more <strong>promotional and user acquisition initiatives</strong>.</li><li>And more…</li></ul><hr><p>We hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the power to significantly change things around and give the project the spark it needs to get the exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce behind it that it deserves.</p><p>As we finally move ahead with a lot of what's been in the works for the last weeks, keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS this week and the next one. We will start publishing lots of new content including follow-up blog posts and the CCS proposals.

Ebenso ist ein kleiner Ausblick für 2021 -\nund sogar darüber hinaus - enthalten. \n\nKommen wir also gleich zur Sache!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInhalte\n * Die neuesten Informationen hinsichtlich der ungewollten Inflation und der\n   anvisierten Lösung\n * Particl V3: Ein Update\n * Ein Vorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung \n * Atomic Swaps im Particl Desktop\n * Ein neuer CCS Vorschlag\n * Particl ist auf Rang #5 in einem Vergleich aller Github Commits in 2020\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDie neuesten Informationen hinsichtlich der ungewollten Inflation und der\nanvisierten Lösung\nSeit der Bekanntmachung der ungewollten Inflation\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/] des PART Coins arbeitet\ndas Particl Team ohne Unterbrechung an verschiedenen Lösungsansätzen, um\nsicherzustellen, dass alle legitimen Outputs (anon) - die seit dem letzten\nHardfork geblockt sind - für die Besitzer wieder nutzbar zu machen. Unrechtmäßig\nerzeugte Outputs (anon) sollen dabei nicht konvertiert werden können und somit\ndauerhaft von der Verwendung blockiert bleiben. Hier nun einige Details zu\ndiesem Prozess sowie die Erläuterung der nächsten Schritte.\n\nDie nächsten Hardforks: Zeitplan\nRingCT- und CT-Überweisungen sind zurzeit nicht möglich. Das hat zur Folge, dass\ndie Benutzung des Particl Marketplace ebenfalls komplett blockiert ist, da diese\nÜberweisungsarten notwendig sind, um das Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem\n[https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-zwei-parteien-treuhand-system/] zu\nermöglichen und grundsätzlich alle Überweisungen zu verschleiern\n[https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-vertrauliche-transaktionen/]. Um die\nAuswirkungen dieser Sperre zu begrenzen (insbesondere die Veröffentlichung von\nParticl V3), hat sich das Team dazu entschieden, mehrere Forks zu planen,\nanstelle von zwei geplanten Forks (wie im vergangenen Blogpost kommuniziert).\n\nDer kommende Hardfork\nDer nächste Hardfork wird aller Voraussicht nach im April stattfinden. RingCT-\nund CT-Überweisungen werden entsperrt und darüber hinaus die Mehrheit der\nlegitimen RingCT-Outputs - (anon) Coins freigegeben. Sobald dieser Prozess\nabgeschlossen ist, wird dies auch die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 auf dem\nMainnet ermöglichen. \n\nAlle technischen Details des zweiten Hardforks kannst du via Github erhalten.\nLink: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\n\nHf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-coreSecond fork of\nexploit\nfix. RCT exploit fix. Hard fork 2 consensus changes: All frozen anon and blind\noutputs must be spent to plain with no blinded change. Blinding factor sum for\nCT txns is ...GitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81]\nAktuell ist das Gros der benötigten Vorraussetzungen für den Hardfork bereit, um\nveröffentlicht zu werden. Das Team ist momentan dabei, den Teil des Codes\nfertigzustellen, der anschliessend sicherstellt, dass alle legitimen\nRingCT-Outputs konvertiert werden können. Daneben wird simultan die interne \nÜberprüfung der Codebasis von RingCT und CT vorgenommen, um die Integrität der\nCodebasis für den Hardfork sicherzustellen. Des Weiteren gibt es einen separaten\nVorschlag (proposal) des Teams, um eine andauernde Mittelbereitstellung für das\nEntwicklerteam zu gewährleisten. Dieser Vorschlag wird weiter unten vorgestellt.\nSollte der Vorschlag für eine erweiterte Mittelbereitstellung Zustimmung finden,\nwird dies durch einen weiteren Hardfork aktiviert.\n\nKonvertierung legitimer RingCT-Outputs \nMit dem zweiten Hardfork wird ein Prozess in Gang gesetzt, um legitime\nvertrauliche (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins zu entsperren und in öffentlich\neinsehbare (public) Coins zu konvertieren. Die Mehrheit der Besitzer wird diesen\nVorgang direkt nach dem Hardfork initiieren können. In manchen Fällen kann es\njedoch notwendig sein, einige manuelle Schritte auszuführen. Für diese Fälle\nwird ein weiterer (dritter) Hardfork notwendig sein.\n\nWir möchten euch in der Folge zwei Verfahren an die Hand geben, mittels der ihr\nvertraulichen (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins entsperren könnt.\n\n 1. Ein sogenannter “low pass filter” ermöglicht, bestimmte Outputs, die nur\n    eine niedrige Anzahl an PART Coins enthalten und unter einem definierten\n    Grenzwert bleiben, direkt zu entsperren. Die Schwachstelle (bug) in Particls\n    Codebasis - die mittlerweile behoben ist - hat es dem Hacker erlaubt,\n    vergleichsweise große Outputs zu erzeugen, die deshalb nicht von diesem\n    Prozess betroffen sein können. Die genaue Höhe des Grenzwerts wird zeitnah\n    (in einem weiteren Blogpost) kommuniziert.\n 2. Besitzer, die legitime (anon) Coins haben, und über diesem Grenzwert liegen,\n    werden einen manuellen Prozess durchlaufen müssen, um ihre Coins zu\n    konvertieren. Dieser Prozess kann durch verschiedene Verfahren\n    bewerkstelligt und vom Nutzer selbst entschieden werden. Alle Forderungen\n    seitens der Besitzer, die über dem Grenzwert liegen, müssen mittels des CCS-\n    Systems (eine Vorlage wird vom Particl Team bereitgestellt werden)\n    vorgetragen und seitens der Community durch eine on-chain Abstimmung aller\n    Nutzer final bestätigt werden. Sobald eine Abstimmung durchgeführt worden\n    ist, werden die betroffenen Outputs mittels eines weiteren Hardforks im\n    Verlauf des Jahres final entsperrt. Diese Vorgehensweise erlaubt es den\n    Prozess so dezentral wie möglich zu organisieren und soll verhindern, dass\n    eine Partei (das Particl Team in diesem Fall) praktisch allein entscheiden\n    kann. Weitere Details werden in einem separaten Blogpost in ein bis zwei\n    Wochen kommuniziert.\n\nDie zweite Variante erfordert einige manuelle Eingaben seitens der betroffenen\nBesitzer. Insofern wird der dafür vorgesehene Zeitraum möglichst weit gefasst\nsein, sodass alle Betroffenen genug Zeit zur Verfügung haben, ihre legitimen\nCoins für sich zu beanspruchen.\n\nBerichtigung der Umlaufmenge (Gesamtsumme von PART) und die Konsequenzen\nEine der Folgen des Fehlers in der Software ist die ungewollte Erhöhung der\nUmlaufmenge von PART Coins, die aktuell noch nicht offiziell durch die\nBlockchain widergespiegelt wird. Aufgrund des verdeckten Charakters des Fehlers,\nwird die Umlaufmenge momentan so wiedergegeben, als ob es keinen Fehler und eine\nErhöhung der Umlaufmenge gegeben hätte. Eine Berichtigung wird zeitnah\nstattfinden, und die tatsächliche Menge auf zwei verschiedenen Wegen\nverifiziert.\n\nAls erstes wird sich die Umlaufmenge automatisch anpassen, sobald Besitzer ihre\nverdeckten (blind) und anonymen (anon) Coins mittels des low pass filters\nkonvertieren. Immer wenn eine Konvertierung erfolgreich stattgefunden hat, wird\ndiese auf der Blockchain angezeigt und dann Teil der legitimen Umlaufmenge sein.\n\nZweitens wird die Umlaufmenge angepasst werden, sobald der dritte Hardfork\nstattgefunden hat, der die legitimen Outputs durch Abstimmung der Community\nmittels des CCS-Systems bestätigt. Alle innerhalb dieses Prozesses entsperrten\nOutputs gehören in der Folge zur neuen legitimen Umlaufmenge.\n\nDas bedeutet, dass am Ende dieses Prozesses, die neu angezeigte Umlaufmenge\nkomplett dem tatsächlichen Wert nach der aufgetretenen Inflation entspricht. Das\nTeam geht im Moment davon aus, dass insgesamt zwischen 1,5 Millionen bis 2\nMillionen PART aufgrund des Fehlers künstlich in Umlauf gebracht worden sind.\nDiese Menge versteht sich inklusive der bereits bestätigten 768.767 PART.  Bitte\nbeachtet, dass es sich hierbei um eine grobe Schätzung handelt, die das Team\naufgrund verschiedener Informationen, die seit dem ersten Hardfork gesammelt\nwerden konnten, annimmt. Die finale Umlaufmenge ist möglicherweise etwas höher\noder etwas niedriger, und wird sich zwischen den bereits genannten Zahlen\neinpendeln.\n\nWeitere Konsequenzen\nDer aufgetretene Fehler hat darüber hinaus weitere Konsequenzen für das\nNetzwerk:\n\n * Eine Erhöhung der Staking-Rewards wird feststellbar sein. Die Höhe der\n   Belohnung wird im Verhältnis der erhöhten Umlaufmenge widergespiegelt. Da\n   Staking-Belohnungen auf einem prozentualen Anteil an der Umlaufmenge\n   basieren, und sollte sich die Umlaufmenge um beispielsweise 15% erhöht haben,\n   erhöhen sich die Staking-Rewards ebenfalls um diesen Prozentsatz.\n * Andere Crypto Projekte, die Particls RingCT-Implementierung per offiziellem\n   Fork übernommen haben, wurden vor der öffentlichen Bekanntmachung vertraulich\n   kontaktiert und über den Fehler informiert. Das Veil Projekt hat feststellen\n   können, dass sie nicht von dem Problem betroffen sind, da sie eine andere\n   Methode zur Implementierung genutzt haben. Ghost musste feststellen, dass sie\n   betroffen sind, und haben daraufhin umgehend das Problem beseitigt. Wir\n   möchten uns bei beiden Teams für die Unterstützung und die sofortige Lösung\n   der delikaten Situation bedanken.\n\nParticl V3: Update\nEs kann berichtet werden, dass sich die Fertigstellung von Particl V3 in den\nletzten Wochen aufgrund persönlicher Probleme, die zu Lasten der zeitlichen\nVerfügbarkeit führten, deutlich verlangsamt hat. Dies wird gerade behoben und\nwir erwarten, dass die Entwicklung von Particl V3 und Particl Desktop in den\nnächsten Tagen wieder im gewohnten Tempo (und wahrscheinlich sogar schneller als\nbisher) fortgesetzt wird.\n\nAus diesem Grund haben wir heute kein spezifisches Update hinsichtlich Particl\nV3. Wir rechnen aber fest damit, einen Bericht zum aktuellen Stand der\nEntwicklung vor dem kommenden Blogpost im April veröffentlichen zu können. Wir\nrechnen ebenfalls damit, vor dem nächsten Projektupdate eine neue\nTestnet-Version veröffentlichen zu können. \n\nVorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung\nWie bereits vor einiger Zeit seitens der Particl Foundation kommuniziert wurde\n[https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement], sind die letzten Zahlungen\nan externe Auftragnehmer (dies schliesst unsere Entwickler ein) gezahlt worden.\nDa die Geldmittel der Particl Foundation praktisch aufgebraucht sind, wird das\nEnde der bisherigen Funktion eingeleitet.\n\nAus diesem Grund empfängt das Particl-Team keine Gehälter mehr, bis eine neue\nLösung gefunden wird, finanzielle Mittel für die Entwicklung am Particl\nMarketplace zu erhalten. Momentan werden alle Arbeiten ohne Bezahlung und\nfreiwillig erbracht. Dies führt leider zu einer erheblichen Reduzierung der\nzeitlichen Verfügbarkeit der meisten Teammitglieder, da andere temporäre\nVerpflichtungen eingegangen werden müssen, um über die Runden zu kommen.\n\nDennoch stehen wir kurz vor der Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 und damit der\nwichtigsten Erweiterung für den Particl Marketplace seit seiner Entstehung. Ein\nProblem stellt momentan ein Mangel an finanziellen Mitteln dar, um die\nwegweisende Veröffentlichung auch angemessene zu vermarkten. Die Korrelation aus\nmangelnden Mitteln für die Entwicklung als auch die Vermarktung haben uns\nmotiviert, an einer Lösung zu arbeiten, die das Projekt langfristig und\nnachhaltig finanziert und eine verlässliche Mittelbereitstellung garantiert.\n\nDas neue Modell für die Finanzmittelbeschaffung erfindet das Rad nicht neu.\nAllerdings würde es dem Particl-Team helfen, dauerhaft an der Weiterentwicklung\nvon Particl zu arbeiten, und dabei nur marginal in die bestehenden Strukturen\neingreifen, diese aber deutlich optimieren. Das Particl-Team richtet sich bei\ndem Entwurf der Finanzmittelbeschaffung nach erfolgreichen Projekten wie bspw.\nDecred und Siacoin, die vergleichbaren Modelle ausgewählt und damit erfolgreich\nwirtschaften konnten.\n\nWas können wir erwarten?\nWährend die Zahlen rund um die neue Finanzverwaltung noch simuliert und\nausgewertet werden, könnte diese die sofortige Vollfinanzierung des\nParticl-Teams zu den aktuellen Preisen ermöglichen und genügend Mittel für\nverschiedene Budgets bereitstellen, die auf die Unterstützung und Förderung des\nProjekts sowie die Erhöhung des Nutzerwachstums ausgerichtet sind.\n\nDa die neue Finanzmittelbeschaffung wesentlich vom Staking und dem Preis von\nPART abhängt, kann eine etwaige Erhöhung des PART-Preises ebenfalls dazu\nbeitragen, dass zusätzliche Mittel zur Verfügung stehen, um das Team zu\nerweitern und Kampagnen zu initiieren, die die Bekanntheit und Nutzerbasis des\nParticl Marketplace vergrößern und ggf. auch Listings bei anderen Kryptobörsen\n ermöglichen. \n\nEs sollte jedoch eingeschränkt werden, dass eine Erweiterung des Teams erst\nmöglich sein wird, wenn wir wieder eine stabile Struktur innerhalb des\nParticl-Teams etabliert haben. Eine Erweiterung ist grundsätzlich ein\nzeitaufwendiger Prozess, der erst in Betracht gezogen wird, wenn es die Zeit\nerlaubt.\n\nAls eine Folge der neuen Finanzmittelbeschaffung könnte das Particl Projekt bald\nwieder in alter Stärke auftrumpfen, womöglich sogar etwas stärker als gewohnt.\nWir erwarten, dass sowohl die Entwicklung selbst als auch die öffentliche\nKommunikation deutlich verbessert werden können und dabei weder Transparenz,\nMarketing, eine Steigerung der Nutzerbasis, Werbemaßnahmen und viele andere\nInitiativen auf der Strecke bleiben. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, Particl nicht\nnur kurzfristig, sondern vor allem für die Zukunft aufzustellen.\n\nDie Finanzmittelbeschaffung als CCS Proposal\nDas Particl-Team arbeitet zurzeit daran, eine bessere Benutzerschnittstelle (UI)\nfür das sogenannte on-Chain Abstimmungsverfahren fertigzustellen. Dieses soll in\nden kommenden 1-2 Wochen fertig sein. Es wird uns erlauben, die Vorschläge\nansprechend zu visualisieren und das Abstimmungsverfahren einzubauen.\n\nDa das neue Finanzmittelbeschaffungsmodell die Staking-Rewards sowie den Anteil,\nder für die Entwicklung und weitere Werbemaßnahmen reserviert ist, anhebt, liegt\ndie oberste Priorität darin, dass die Particl-Community hierzu abstimmt und auf\nder Protokoll-Ebene zu einer Einigung in der Sache kommt.\n\nEin weiterer wichtiger Aspekt besteht darin, Prozesse deutlich transparenter zu\ngestalten. Das bedeutet, dass die Finanzmittelverwaltung ebenfalls via on-Chain\nAbstimmung bestätigt wird. Jedes Quartal wird deshalb seitens des Particl-Teams\nein CCS Vorschlag unterbreitet, der daraufhin von der Particl-Community auf der\nProtokoll-Ebene bestätigt oder abgelehnt wird. Salopp formuliert soll dieser\nProzess sicherstellen, dass die Particl-Community das letzte Wort darüber hat,\nin welche Richtung es geht. Dabei sollen Transparenz, Dezentralisierung und\nGovernance (Kontroll- und Steuerungsstruktur) die Eckpfeiler darstellen, um das\nParticl-Team rechenschaftspflichtig gegenüber der Community zu machen und stets\nim besten Interesse des gesamten Ökosystem zu handeln.\n\nWeitere Informationen zu diesem wegweisenden Schritt in die Zukunft von Particl\nwerden in einem weiteren Blogpost zeitnah veröffentlicht. Hier werden dann auch\ndie genauen Details, Zahlen und alle weiteren wichtigen Informationen und\nGedanken zum Proposal (Vorschlag) der neuen Finanzverwaltung kommuniziert. \n\nAtomic Swaps im Particl Desktop\nDoch das ist noch nicht alles. In den letzten Monaten wurde an einem\nÜberraschungs-Projekt gearbeitet, das wir heute offiziell zeigen. Dank eines\nneuen Particl basierten Austauschprotokolls, kommen Atomic Swaps direkt in den\nParticl Desktop.\n\nEarly Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)Teconvert,\nunser Particl Core Entwickler, hat BasicSwap entworfen, ein anonymes\nDEX-Protokoll, dass es mittels SMSG erlaubt, anonym und ohne dritte\nErfüllungsgehilfen Kryptowährungen durch Atomic Swaps zu tauschen. BasicSwap\nfunktioniert einwandfrei und wurde in einer geschlossenen Beta-Testphase bereits\nseit Wochen ausprobiert. Das DEX-Prokoll unterstützt momentan Particl, Monero,\nBitcoin, and Litecoin, und macht den Handel mit Kryptowährungen\nwiderstandsfähiger und vor allem für jeden zugänglich.\n\nBasicSwap nutzt Particls SMSG P2P-Netzwerk und ein eigenes Atomic\nSwap-Protokoll, dass es euch ermöglicht, Kryptowährungen direkt zu tauschen,\nohne dass dabei eine weitere Partei benötigt wird oder andere \"Wrapped Coins\"\nzum Einsatz kommen. Die Swaps werden relativ schnell durchgeführt, sodass ein\nTausch zwischen PART und LTC (oder auch PART und XMR) zwischen 20-25 Minuten\nbenötigt. Die individuell benötigte Zeit für den kompletten Vorgang variiert und\nhängt von den Block-Bestätigungszeiten der jeweiligen Kryptowährungen ab. \n\nCompleted Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)Um das alles so\neinfach wie möglich zu gestalten, wird BasicSwap direkt in den Particl Desktop\nintegriert. BasicSwap wird jedoch noch etwas Entwicklungszeit benötigen und\ndaher nicht direkt mit Particl V3 veröffentlicht werden, sondern etwas später,\nbei einem der darauffolgenden Updates. Obwohl die aktuelle Situation dazu\ngeführt hat, dass dieses Projekt nicht an erster Stelle in Tecnoverts\nAufgabenliste steht, erwarten wir, dass BasicSwap die neue Mittelbereitstellung\n(die wir weiter oben vorgestellt haben) noch weiter verbessert.\n\nEin neuer CCS Vorschlag\nVor einigen Wochen wurde eine neuer CCS Vorschlag von ffmad (Community-Mitglied)\nvorgestellt, der die Entwicklung einer Market API\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market] (Particl V3) Dokumentation zum Ziel\nhat. Dieser Vorschlag soll es Nutzern erleichtern, eine Market Node zu\ninitiieren, die nach dem Vorbild von DeMarkets.io für Particl V2 funktioniert.\n\nCheckt den Vorschlag von ffmad hier\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/market%20api%20documentation.html] und\nunterstützt diesen, sollte euch das Anliegen einer Market API Dokumentation\nwichtig sein. Die aufgerufene Summe beträgt 1.200 PART. \n\nParticl ist auf Rang #5 in einem Vergleich aller Github Commits in 2020\nCryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commitsCryptoMiso is a\nweb\nservice ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most\npopular Github repository.CryptoMisoBart Claeys [https://www.cryptomiso.com/]\n2020 war mit Sicherheit kein ganz gewöhnliches Jahr für Particl. Das hat hängt\nbesonders damit zusammen, dass ein Großteil der Entwicklung am Marketplace\nhinter verschlossenen Türen aka privaten Repos stattgefunden hat. Das hatte zur\nFolge, dass nur ein äußerst kleiner Teil des Fortschritts öffentlich auf Github\neinsehbar war. Als Fork von Bitcoin kommt Particl dennoch in den Genuss den\nFortschritt und die Arbeit der Entwicklergemeinde an Bitcoin zu integrieren und\nund für Particls Codebasis zu übernehmen.\n\nTecnovert ist Particls Versicherung dafür, dass die Codebasis von Particl immer\nmit Bitcoin standhält. Dass das jedoch kein einfaches Kopieren ist, sollte allen\nklar sein, da die Updates sorgfältig modifiziert und mit Particls Blockchain\nharmonisiert werden müssen, ohne dabei irgendwelche Probleme und Bugs zu\nkreieren. Diese Arbeit spiegelt sich in dem von CryptoMiso jährlich\nherausgegebenen Ranking aller Github Commits wider. Particl liegt auf einem\näußerst respektablen 5. Platz in den vergangenen 12 Monaten, ohne dabei\nüberhaupt alle Entwicklungsfortschritte, die in nicht-öffentlichen Repos oder an\nBasicSwap stattgefunden haben, hinzu zu zählen.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Best is Yet to Come\nAuch wenn die aktuelle Situation nicht einfach erscheint, schauen wir\nzuversichtlich in die Zukunft von Particl und sind uns sicher, dass wir mit den\nhier skizzierten Schritten das Ruder umreißen und die bis dato erfolgreichste\nZeit des Particl Projects einleiten können.\n\nThe best is yet to come! Da sind wir uns alle sicher, und hoffen, dass wir euch\nmit dem Update Lust auf mehr in 2021 und die Zeit danach geben konnten.

Unrechtmäßig erzeugte Outputs (anon) sollen dabei nicht konvertiert werden können und somit dauerhaft von der Verwendung blockiert bleiben. Hier nun einige Details zu diesem Prozess sowie die Erläuterung der nächsten Schritte.</p><h3 id=\"die-n-chsten-hardforks-zeitplan\">Die nächsten Hardforks: Zeitplan</h3><p>RingCT- und CT-Überweisungen sind zurzeit nicht möglich. Das hat zur Folge, dass die Benutzung des Particl Marketplace ebenfalls komplett blockiert ist, da diese Überweisungsarten notwendig sind, um das <a href=\"https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-zwei-parteien-treuhand-system/\">Zweiparteien-Treuhandsystem</a> zu ermöglichen und grundsätzlich alle <a href=\"https://particl.news/de/particl-erklaert-vertrauliche-transaktionen/\">Überweisungen zu verschleiern</a>. Um die Auswirkungen dieser Sperre zu begrenzen (insbesondere die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3), hat sich das Team dazu entschieden, mehrere Forks zu planen, anstelle von zwei geplanten Forks (wie im vergangenen Blogpost kommuniziert).</p><h3 id=\"der-kommende-hardfork\">Der kommende Hardfork</h3><p>Der nächste Hardfork wird aller Voraussicht nach im April stattfinden. RingCT- und CT-Überweisungen werden entsperrt und darüber hinaus die Mehrheit der legitimen RingCT-Outputs - (anon) Coins freigegeben. Sobald dieser Prozess abgeschlossen ist, wird dies auch die Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 auf dem Mainnet ermöglichen. </p><p>Alle technischen Details des zweiten Hardforks kannst du via Github erhalten.

Das Team ist momentan dabei, den Teil des Codes fertigzustellen, der anschliessend sicherstellt, dass alle legitimen RingCT-Outputs konvertiert werden können. Daneben wird simultan die interne <strong>Überprüfung der Codebasis von RingCT und CT</strong> vorgenommen, um die Integrität der Codebasis für den Hardfork sicherzustellen. Des Weiteren gibt es einen separaten Vorschlag (proposal) des Teams, um eine andauernde Mittelbereitstellung für das Entwicklerteam zu gewährleisten. Dieser Vorschlag wird weiter unten vorgestellt. Sollte der Vorschlag für eine erweiterte Mittelbereitstellung Zustimmung finden, wird dies durch einen weiteren Hardfork aktiviert.</p><h3 id=\"konvertierung-legitimer-ringct-outputs\">Konvertierung legitimer RingCT-Outputs </h3><p>Mit dem zweiten Hardfork wird ein Prozess in Gang gesetzt, um legitime vertrauliche (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins zu entsperren und in öffentlich einsehbare (public) Coins zu konvertieren. Die Mehrheit der Besitzer wird diesen Vorgang direkt nach dem Hardfork initiieren können. In manchen Fällen kann es jedoch notwendig sein, einige manuelle Schritte auszuführen. Für diese Fälle wird ein weiterer (dritter) Hardfork notwendig sein.</p><p>Wir möchten euch in der Folge zwei Verfahren an die Hand geben, mittels der ihr vertraulichen (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins entsperren könnt.</p><ol><li>Ein sogenannter “<strong><strong>low pass filter</strong></strong>” ermöglicht, bestimmte Outputs, die nur eine niedrige Anzahl an PART Coins enthalten und unter einem definierten Grenzwert bleiben, direkt zu entsperren. Die Schwachstelle (bug) in Particls Codebasis - die mittlerweile behoben ist - hat es dem Hacker erlaubt, vergleichsweise große Outputs zu erzeugen, die deshalb nicht von diesem Prozess betroffen sein können. Die genaue Höhe des Grenzwerts wird zeitnah (in einem weiteren Blogpost) kommuniziert.</li><li>Besitzer, die legitime (anon) Coins haben, und über diesem Grenzwert liegen, werden einen <strong>manuellen Prozess</strong> durchlaufen müssen, um ihre Coins zu konvertieren. Dieser Prozess kann durch verschiedene Verfahren bewerkstelligt und vom Nutzer selbst entschieden werden. Alle Forderungen seitens der Besitzer, die über dem Grenzwert liegen, müssen mittels des CCS- Systems (eine Vorlage wird vom Particl Team bereitgestellt werden) vorgetragen und seitens der Community durch eine on-chain Abstimmung aller Nutzer final bestätigt werden. Sobald eine Abstimmung durchgeführt worden ist, werden die betroffenen Outputs mittels eines weiteren Hardforks im Verlauf des Jahres final entsperrt. Diese Vorgehensweise erlaubt es den Prozess so dezentral wie möglich zu organisieren und soll verhindern, dass eine Partei (das Particl Team in diesem Fall) praktisch allein entscheiden kann. Weitere Details werden in einem separaten Blogpost in ein bis zwei Wochen kommuniziert.</li></ol><p>Die zweite Variante erfordert einige manuelle Eingaben seitens der betroffenen Besitzer. Insofern wird der dafür vorgesehene Zeitraum möglichst weit gefasst sein, sodass alle Betroffenen genug Zeit zur Verfügung haben, ihre legitimen Coins für sich zu beanspruchen.</p><h3 id=\"berichtigung-der-umlaufmenge-gesamtsumme-von-part-und-die-konsequenzen\">Berichtigung der Umlaufmenge (Gesamtsumme von PART) und die Konsequenzen</h3><p>Eine der Folgen des Fehlers in der Software ist die ungewollte Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge von PART Coins, die aktuell noch nicht offiziell durch die Blockchain widergespiegelt wird. Aufgrund des verdeckten Charakters des Fehlers, wird die Umlaufmenge momentan so wiedergegeben, als ob es keinen Fehler und eine Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge gegeben hätte. Eine Berichtigung wird zeitnah stattfinden, und die tatsächliche Menge auf zwei verschiedenen Wegen verifiziert.</p><p><strong>Als erstes wird sich die Umlaufmenge automatisch anpassen, sobald Besitzer ihre verdeckten (blind) und anonymen (anon) Coins mittels des low pass filters konvertieren</strong>. Immer wenn eine Konvertierung erfolgreich stattgefunden hat, wird diese auf der Blockchain angezeigt und dann Teil der legitimen Umlaufmenge sein.</p><p><strong>Zweitens wird die Umlaufmenge angepasst werden, sobald der dritte Hardfork stattgefunden hat, der die legitimen Outputs durch Abstimmung der Community mittels des CCS-Systems bestätigt</strong>. Alle innerhalb dieses Prozesses entsperrten Outputs gehören in der Folge zur neuen legitimen Umlaufmenge.</p><p>Das bedeutet, dass am Ende dieses Prozesses, die neu angezeigte Umlaufmenge komplett dem tatsächlichen Wert nach der aufgetretenen Inflation entspricht. Das Team geht im Moment davon aus, dass insgesamt zwischen 1,5 Millionen bis 2 Millionen PART aufgrund des Fehlers künstlich in Umlauf gebracht worden sind. Diese Menge versteht sich inklusive der bereits bestätigten 768.767 PART.  Bitte beachtet, dass es sich hierbei um eine grobe Schätzung handelt, die das Team aufgrund verschiedener Informationen, die seit dem ersten Hardfork gesammelt werden konnten, annimmt. Die finale Umlaufmenge ist möglicherweise etwas höher oder etwas niedriger, und wird sich zwischen den bereits genannten Zahlen einpendeln.</p><h3 id=\"weitere-konsequenzen\">Weitere Konsequenzen</h3><p>Der aufgetretene Fehler hat darüber hinaus weitere Konsequenzen für das Netzwerk:</p><ul><li><strong>Eine Erhöhung der Staking-Rewards wird feststellbar sein</strong>. Die Höhe der Belohnung wird im Verhältnis der erhöhten Umlaufmenge widergespiegelt. Da Staking-Belohnungen auf einem prozentualen Anteil an der Umlaufmenge basieren, und sollte sich die Umlaufmenge um beispielsweise 15% erhöht haben, erhöhen sich die Staking-Rewards ebenfalls um diesen Prozentsatz.</li><li>Andere Crypto Projekte, die Particls RingCT-Implementierung per offiziellem Fork übernommen haben, wurden vor der öffentlichen Bekanntmachung vertraulich kontaktiert und über den Fehler informiert. Das Veil Projekt hat feststellen können, dass sie nicht von dem Problem betroffen sind, da sie eine andere Methode zur Implementierung genutzt haben. Ghost musste feststellen, dass sie betroffen sind, und haben daraufhin umgehend das Problem beseitigt. Wir möchten uns bei beiden Teams für die Unterstützung und die sofortige Lösung der delikaten Situation bedanken.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3: Update</h1><p>Es kann berichtet werden, dass sich die Fertigstellung von Particl V3 in den letzten Wochen aufgrund persönlicher Probleme, die zu Lasten der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit führten, deutlich verlangsamt hat. Dies wird gerade behoben und wir erwarten, dass die Entwicklung von Particl V3 und Particl Desktop in den nächsten Tagen wieder im gewohnten Tempo (und wahrscheinlich sogar schneller als bisher) fortgesetzt wird.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund haben wir heute kein spezifisches Update hinsichtlich Particl V3. Wir rechnen aber fest damit, einen Bericht zum aktuellen Stand der Entwicklung vor dem kommenden Blogpost im April veröffentlichen zu können. Wir rechnen ebenfalls damit, vor dem nächsten Projektupdate eine neue Testnet-Version veröffentlichen zu können. </p><h1 id=\"vorschlag-f-r-eine-verbesserte-und-nachhaltige-finanzverwaltung\">Vorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung</h1><p>Wie bereits vor einiger Zeit <a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">seitens der Particl Foundation kommuniziert wurde</a>, sind die letzten Zahlungen an externe Auftragnehmer (dies schliesst unsere Entwickler ein) gezahlt worden. Da die Geldmittel der Particl Foundation praktisch aufgebraucht sind, <strong>wird das Ende der bisherigen Funktion eingeleitet</strong>.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund empfängt das Particl-Team keine Gehälter mehr, bis eine neue Lösung gefunden wird, finanzielle Mittel für die Entwicklung am Particl Marketplace zu erhalten. Momentan werden alle Arbeiten ohne Bezahlung und freiwillig erbracht. Dies führt leider zu einer erheblichen Reduzierung der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit der meisten Teammitglieder, da andere temporäre Verpflichtungen eingegangen werden müssen, um über die Runden zu kommen.</p><p>Dennoch stehen wir kurz vor der Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 und damit der wichtigsten Erweiterung für den Particl Marketplace seit seiner Entstehung. Ein Problem stellt momentan ein Mangel an finanziellen Mitteln dar, um die wegweisende Veröffentlichung auch angemessene zu vermarkten. Die Korrelation aus mangelnden Mitteln für die Entwicklung als auch die Vermarktung haben uns motiviert, an einer Lösung zu arbeiten, die das Projekt langfristig und nachhaltig finanziert und eine verlässliche Mittelbereitstellung garantiert.</p><p>Das neue Modell für die Finanzmittelbeschaffung erfindet das Rad nicht neu. Allerdings würde es dem Particl-Team helfen, dauerhaft an der Weiterentwicklung von Particl zu arbeiten, und dabei nur marginal in die bestehenden Strukturen eingreifen, diese aber deutlich optimieren. Das Particl-Team richtet sich bei dem Entwurf der Finanzmittelbeschaffung nach erfolgreichen Projekten wie bspw. Decred und Siacoin, die vergleichbaren Modelle ausgewählt und damit erfolgreich wirtschaften konnten.</p><h3 id=\"was-k-nnen-wir-erwarten\">Was können wir erwarten?</h3><p>Während die Zahlen rund um die neue Finanzverwaltung noch simuliert und ausgewertet werden, könnte diese die sofortige Vollfinanzierung des Particl-Teams zu den aktuellen Preisen ermöglichen und genügend Mittel für verschiedene Budgets bereitstellen, die auf die Unterstützung und Förderung des Projekts sowie die Erhöhung des Nutzerwachstums ausgerichtet sind.</p><p>Da die neue Finanzmittelbeschaffung wesentlich vom Staking und dem Preis von PART abhängt, kann eine etwaige Erhöhung des PART-Preises ebenfalls dazu beitragen, dass zusätzliche Mittel zur Verfügung stehen, um das Team zu erweitern und Kampagnen zu initiieren, die die Bekanntheit und Nutzerbasis des Particl Marketplace vergrößern und ggf. auch Listings bei anderen Kryptobörsen  ermöglichen. </p><p>Es sollte jedoch eingeschränkt werden, dass eine Erweiterung des Teams erst möglich sein wird, wenn wir wieder eine stabile Struktur innerhalb des Particl-Teams etabliert haben. Eine Erweiterung ist grundsätzlich ein zeitaufwendiger Prozess, der erst in Betracht gezogen wird, wenn es die Zeit erlaubt.</p><p>Als eine Folge der neuen Finanzmittelbeschaffung könnte das Particl Projekt bald wieder in alter Stärke auftrumpfen, womöglich sogar etwas stärker als gewohnt. Wir erwarten, dass sowohl die Entwicklung selbst als auch die öffentliche Kommunikation deutlich verbessert werden können und dabei weder Transparenz, Marketing, eine Steigerung der Nutzerbasis, Werbemaßnahmen und viele andere Initiativen auf der Strecke bleiben. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, Particl nicht nur kurzfristig, sondern vor allem für die Zukunft aufzustellen.</p><h3 id=\"die-finanzmittelbeschaffung-als-ccs-proposal\">Die Finanzmittelbeschaffung als CCS Proposal</h3><p>Das Particl-Team arbeitet zurzeit daran, eine bessere Benutzerschnittstelle (UI) für das sogenannte on-Chain Abstimmungsverfahren fertigzustellen. Dieses soll in den kommenden 1-2 Wochen fertig sein. Es wird uns erlauben, die Vorschläge ansprechend zu visualisieren und das Abstimmungsverfahren einzubauen.</p><p>Da das neue Finanzmittelbeschaffungsmodell die Staking-Rewards sowie den Anteil, der für die Entwicklung und weitere Werbemaßnahmen reserviert ist, anhebt, liegt die oberste Priorität darin, dass die Particl-Community hierzu abstimmt und auf der Protokoll-Ebene zu einer Einigung in der Sache kommt.</p><p>Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt besteht darin, Prozesse deutlich transparenter zu gestalten. Das bedeutet, dass die Finanzmittelverwaltung ebenfalls via on-Chain Abstimmung bestätigt wird. <strong>Jedes Quartal wird deshalb seitens des Particl-Teams ein CCS Vorschlag unterbreitet, der daraufhin von der Particl-Community auf der Protokoll-Ebene bestätigt oder abgelehnt wird</strong>. Salopp formuliert soll dieser Prozess sicherstellen, dass die Particl-Community das letzte Wort darüber hat, in welche Richtung es geht. Dabei sollen Transparenz, Dezentralisierung und Governance (Kontroll- und Steuerungsstruktur) die Eckpfeiler darstellen, um das Particl-Team rechenschaftspflichtig gegenüber der Community zu machen und stets im besten Interesse des gesamten Ökosystem zu handeln.</p><p>Weitere Informationen zu diesem wegweisenden Schritt in die Zukunft von Particl werden in einem weiteren Blogpost zeitnah veröffentlicht. Hier werden dann auch die genauen Details, Zahlen und alle weiteren wichtigen Informationen und Gedanken zum Proposal (Vorschlag) der neuen Finanzverwaltung kommuniziert. </p><h1 id=\"atomic-swaps-im-particl-desktop\">Atomic Swaps im Particl Desktop</h1><p>Doch das ist noch nicht alles. In den letzten Monaten wurde an einem Überraschungs-Projekt gearbeitet, das wir heute offiziell zeigen. Dank eines neuen Particl basierten Austauschprotokolls, kommen Atomic Swaps direkt in den Particl Desktop.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em><em>Early Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Teconvert, unser Particl Core Entwickler, hat <em><em>BasicSwap</em> </em>entworfen, ein anonymes DEX-Protokoll, dass es mittels SMSG erlaubt, anonym und ohne dritte Erfüllungsgehilfen Kryptowährungen durch Atomic Swaps zu tauschen. BasicSwap funktioniert einwandfrei und wurde in einer geschlossenen Beta-Testphase bereits seit Wochen ausprobiert. Das <strong>DEX-Prokoll unterstützt momentan<strong> Particl, Monero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin</strong></strong>, und macht den Handel mit Kryptowährungen widerstandsfähiger und vor allem für jeden zugänglich.</p><p>BasicSwap nutzt Particls SMSG P2P-Netzwerk und ein eigenes Atomic Swap-Protokoll, dass es euch ermöglicht, Kryptowährungen direkt zu tauschen, ohne dass dabei eine weitere Partei benötigt wird oder andere \"Wrapped Coins\" zum Einsatz kommen. Die Swaps werden relativ schnell durchgeführt, sodass ein Tausch zwischen PART und LTC (oder auch PART und XMR) zwischen 20-25 Minuten benötigt. Die individuell benötigte Zeit für den kompletten Vorgang variiert und hängt von den Block-Bestätigungszeiten der jeweiligen Kryptowährungen ab. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png 1391w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em><em>Completed Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Um das alles so einfach wie möglich zu gestalten, <strong>wird BasicSwap direkt in den Particl Desktop integriert</strong>.

Obwohl die aktuelle Situation dazu geführt hat, dass dieses Projekt nicht an erster Stelle in Tecnoverts Aufgabenliste steht, erwarten wir, dass BasicSwap die neue Mittelbereitstellung (die wir weiter oben vorgestellt haben) noch weiter verbessert.</p><h1 id=\"ein-neuer-ccs-vorschlag\">Ein neuer CCS Vorschlag</h1><p>Vor einigen Wochen wurde eine neuer CCS Vorschlag von ffmad (Community-Mitglied) vorgestellt, der die Entwicklung einer <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">Market API</a> (Particl V3) Dokumentation zum Ziel hat. Dieser Vorschlag soll es Nutzern erleichtern, eine Market Node zu initiieren, die nach dem Vorbild von DeMarkets.io für Particl V2 funktioniert.</p><p>Checkt den Vorschlag von ffmad <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/market%20api%20documentation.html\">hier</a> und unterstützt diesen, sollte euch das Anliegen einer Market API Dokumentation wichtig sein. Die aufgerufene Summe beträgt 1.200 PART. </p><h1 id=\"particl-ist-auf-rang-5-in-einem-vergleich-aller-github-commits-in-2020\">Particl ist auf Rang #5 in einem Vergleich aller Github Commits in 2020</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">CryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commits</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">CryptoMiso is a web service ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most popular Github repository.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">CryptoMiso</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Bart Claeys</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/assets/miso_fbshare.png\"></div></a></figure><p>2020 war mit Sicherheit kein ganz gewöhnliches Jahr für Particl. Das hat hängt besonders damit zusammen, dass ein Großteil der Entwicklung am Marketplace hinter verschlossenen Türen aka privaten Repos stattgefunden hat. Das hatte zur Folge, dass nur ein äußerst kleiner Teil des Fortschritts öffentlich auf Github einsehbar war. Als Fork von Bitcoin kommt Particl dennoch in den Genuss den Fortschritt und die Arbeit der Entwicklergemeinde an Bitcoin zu integrieren und und für Particls Codebasis zu übernehmen.</p><p>Tecnovert ist Particls Versicherung dafür, dass die Codebasis von Particl immer mit Bitcoin standhält. Dass das jedoch kein einfaches Kopieren ist, sollte allen klar sein, da die Updates sorgfältig modifiziert und mit Particls Blockchain harmonisiert werden müssen, ohne dabei irgendwelche Probleme und Bugs zu kreieren. Diese Arbeit spiegelt sich in dem von CryptoMiso jährlich herausgegebenen Ranking aller Github Commits wider. Particl liegt auf einem äußerst respektablen 5. Platz in den vergangenen 12 Monaten, ohne dabei überhaupt alle Entwicklungsfortschritte, die in nicht-öffentlichen Repos oder an BasicSwap stattgefunden haben, hinzu zu zählen.</p><hr><h1 id=\"the-best-is-yet-to-come\">The Best is Yet to Come</h1><p>Auch wenn die aktuelle Situation nicht einfach erscheint, schauen wir zuversichtlich in die Zukunft von Particl und sind uns sicher, dass wir mit den hier skizzierten Schritten das Ruder umreißen und die bis dato erfolgreichste Zeit des Particl Projects einleiten können.</p><p>The best is yet to come! Da sind wir uns alle sicher, und hoffen, dass wir euch mit dem Update Lust auf mehr in 2021 und die Zeit danach geben konnten.

Das Team ist momentan dabei, den Teil des Codes fertigzustellen, der anschliessend sicherstellt, dass alle legitimen RingCT-Outputs konvertiert werden können. Daneben wird simultan die interne <strong>Überprüfung der Codebasis von RingCT und CT</strong> vorgenommen, um die Integrität der Codebasis für den Hardfork sicherzustellen. Des Weiteren gibt es einen separaten Vorschlag (proposal) des Teams, um eine andauernde Mittelbereitstellung für das Entwicklerteam zu gewährleisten. Dieser Vorschlag wird weiter unten vorgestellt. Sollte der Vorschlag für eine erweiterte Mittelbereitstellung Zustimmung finden, wird dies durch einen weiteren Hardfork aktiviert.</p><h3 id=\"konvertierung-legitimer-ringct-outputs\">Konvertierung legitimer RingCT-Outputs </h3><p>Mit dem zweiten Hardfork wird ein Prozess in Gang gesetzt, um legitime vertrauliche (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins zu entsperren und in öffentlich einsehbare (public) Coins zu konvertieren. Die Mehrheit der Besitzer wird diesen Vorgang direkt nach dem Hardfork initiieren können. In manchen Fällen kann es jedoch notwendig sein, einige manuelle Schritte auszuführen. Für diese Fälle wird ein weiterer (dritter) Hardfork notwendig sein.</p><p>Wir möchten euch in der Folge zwei Verfahren an die Hand geben, mittels der ihr vertraulichen (blind) und anonyme (anon) Coins entsperren könnt.</p><ol><li>Ein sogenannter “<strong><strong>low pass filter</strong></strong>” ermöglicht, bestimmte Outputs, die nur eine niedrige Anzahl an PART Coins enthalten und unter einem definierten Grenzwert bleiben, direkt zu entsperren. Die Schwachstelle (bug) in Particls Codebasis - die mittlerweile behoben ist - hat es dem Hacker erlaubt, vergleichsweise große Outputs zu erzeugen, die deshalb nicht von diesem Prozess betroffen sein können. Die genaue Höhe des Grenzwerts wird zeitnah (in einem weiteren Blogpost) kommuniziert.</li><li>Besitzer, die legitime (anon) Coins haben, und über diesem Grenzwert liegen, werden einen <strong>manuellen Prozess</strong> durchlaufen müssen, um ihre Coins zu konvertieren. Dieser Prozess kann durch verschiedene Verfahren bewerkstelligt und vom Nutzer selbst entschieden werden. Alle Forderungen seitens der Besitzer, die über dem Grenzwert liegen, müssen mittels des CCS- Systems (eine Vorlage wird vom Particl Team bereitgestellt werden) vorgetragen und seitens der Community durch eine on-chain Abstimmung aller Nutzer final bestätigt werden. Sobald eine Abstimmung durchgeführt worden ist, werden die betroffenen Outputs mittels eines weiteren Hardforks im Verlauf des Jahres final entsperrt. Diese Vorgehensweise erlaubt es den Prozess so dezentral wie möglich zu organisieren und soll verhindern, dass eine Partei (das Particl Team in diesem Fall) praktisch allein entscheiden kann. Weitere Details werden in einem separaten Blogpost in ein bis zwei Wochen kommuniziert.</li></ol><p>Die zweite Variante erfordert einige manuelle Eingaben seitens der betroffenen Besitzer. Insofern wird der dafür vorgesehene Zeitraum möglichst weit gefasst sein, sodass alle Betroffenen genug Zeit zur Verfügung haben, ihre legitimen Coins für sich zu beanspruchen.</p><h3 id=\"berichtigung-der-umlaufmenge-gesamtsumme-von-part-und-die-konsequenzen\">Berichtigung der Umlaufmenge (Gesamtsumme von PART) und die Konsequenzen</h3><p>Eine der Folgen des Fehlers in der Software ist die ungewollte Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge von PART Coins, die aktuell noch nicht offiziell durch die Blockchain widergespiegelt wird. Aufgrund des verdeckten Charakters des Fehlers, wird die Umlaufmenge momentan so wiedergegeben, als ob es keinen Fehler und eine Erhöhung der Umlaufmenge gegeben hätte. Eine Berichtigung wird zeitnah stattfinden, und die tatsächliche Menge auf zwei verschiedenen Wegen verifiziert.</p><p><strong>Als erstes wird sich die Umlaufmenge automatisch anpassen, sobald Besitzer ihre verdeckten (blind) und anonymen (anon) Coins mittels des low pass filters konvertieren</strong>. Immer wenn eine Konvertierung erfolgreich stattgefunden hat, wird diese auf der Blockchain angezeigt und dann Teil der legitimen Umlaufmenge sein.</p><p><strong>Zweitens wird die Umlaufmenge angepasst werden, sobald der dritte Hardfork stattgefunden hat, der die legitimen Outputs durch Abstimmung der Community mittels des CCS-Systems bestätigt</strong>. Alle innerhalb dieses Prozesses entsperrten Outputs gehören in der Folge zur neuen legitimen Umlaufmenge.</p><p>Das bedeutet, dass am Ende dieses Prozesses, die neu angezeigte Umlaufmenge komplett dem tatsächlichen Wert nach der aufgetretenen Inflation entspricht. Das Team geht im Moment davon aus, dass insgesamt zwischen 1,5 Millionen bis 2 Millionen PART aufgrund des Fehlers künstlich in Umlauf gebracht worden sind. Diese Menge versteht sich inklusive der bereits bestätigten 768.767 PART.  Bitte beachtet, dass es sich hierbei um eine grobe Schätzung handelt, die das Team aufgrund verschiedener Informationen, die seit dem ersten Hardfork gesammelt werden konnten, annimmt. Die finale Umlaufmenge ist möglicherweise etwas höher oder etwas niedriger, und wird sich zwischen den bereits genannten Zahlen einpendeln.</p><h3 id=\"weitere-konsequenzen\">Weitere Konsequenzen</h3><p>Der aufgetretene Fehler hat darüber hinaus weitere Konsequenzen für das Netzwerk:</p><ul><li><strong>Eine Erhöhung der Staking-Rewards wird feststellbar sein</strong>. Die Höhe der Belohnung wird im Verhältnis der erhöhten Umlaufmenge widergespiegelt. Da Staking-Belohnungen auf einem prozentualen Anteil an der Umlaufmenge basieren, und sollte sich die Umlaufmenge um beispielsweise 15% erhöht haben, erhöhen sich die Staking-Rewards ebenfalls um diesen Prozentsatz.</li><li>Andere Crypto Projekte, die Particls RingCT-Implementierung per offiziellem Fork übernommen haben, wurden vor der öffentlichen Bekanntmachung vertraulich kontaktiert und über den Fehler informiert. Das Veil Projekt hat feststellen können, dass sie nicht von dem Problem betroffen sind, da sie eine andere Methode zur Implementierung genutzt haben. Ghost musste feststellen, dass sie betroffen sind, und haben daraufhin umgehend das Problem beseitigt. Wir möchten uns bei beiden Teams für die Unterstützung und die sofortige Lösung der delikaten Situation bedanken.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3: Update</h1><p>Es kann berichtet werden, dass sich die Fertigstellung von Particl V3 in den letzten Wochen aufgrund persönlicher Probleme, die zu Lasten der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit führten, deutlich verlangsamt hat. Dies wird gerade behoben und wir erwarten, dass die Entwicklung von Particl V3 und Particl Desktop in den nächsten Tagen wieder im gewohnten Tempo (und wahrscheinlich sogar schneller als bisher) fortgesetzt wird.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund haben wir heute kein spezifisches Update hinsichtlich Particl V3. Wir rechnen aber fest damit, einen Bericht zum aktuellen Stand der Entwicklung vor dem kommenden Blogpost im April veröffentlichen zu können. Wir rechnen ebenfalls damit, vor dem nächsten Projektupdate eine neue Testnet-Version veröffentlichen zu können. </p><h1 id=\"vorschlag-f-r-eine-verbesserte-und-nachhaltige-finanzverwaltung\">Vorschlag für eine verbesserte und nachhaltige Finanzverwaltung</h1><p>Wie bereits vor einiger Zeit <a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">seitens der Particl Foundation kommuniziert wurde</a>, sind die letzten Zahlungen an externe Auftragnehmer (dies schliesst unsere Entwickler ein) gezahlt worden. Da die Geldmittel der Particl Foundation praktisch aufgebraucht sind, <strong>wird das Ende der bisherigen Funktion eingeleitet</strong>.</p><p>Aus diesem Grund empfängt das Particl-Team keine Gehälter mehr, bis eine neue Lösung gefunden wird, finanzielle Mittel für die Entwicklung am Particl Marketplace zu erhalten. Momentan werden alle Arbeiten ohne Bezahlung und freiwillig erbracht. Dies führt leider zu einer erheblichen Reduzierung der zeitlichen Verfügbarkeit der meisten Teammitglieder, da andere temporäre Verpflichtungen eingegangen werden müssen, um über die Runden zu kommen.</p><p>Dennoch stehen wir kurz vor der Veröffentlichung von Particl V3 und damit der wichtigsten Erweiterung für den Particl Marketplace seit seiner Entstehung. Ein Problem stellt momentan ein Mangel an finanziellen Mitteln dar, um die wegweisende Veröffentlichung auch angemessene zu vermarkten. Die Korrelation aus mangelnden Mitteln für die Entwicklung als auch die Vermarktung haben uns motiviert, an einer Lösung zu arbeiten, die das Projekt langfristig und nachhaltig finanziert und eine verlässliche Mittelbereitstellung garantiert.</p><p>Das neue Modell für die Finanzmittelbeschaffung erfindet das Rad nicht neu. Allerdings würde es dem Particl-Team helfen, dauerhaft an der Weiterentwicklung von Particl zu arbeiten, und dabei nur marginal in die bestehenden Strukturen eingreifen, diese aber deutlich optimieren. Das Particl-Team richtet sich bei dem Entwurf der Finanzmittelbeschaffung nach erfolgreichen Projekten wie bspw. Decred und Siacoin, die vergleichbaren Modelle ausgewählt und damit erfolgreich wirtschaften konnten.</p><h3 id=\"was-k-nnen-wir-erwarten\">Was können wir erwarten?</h3><p>Während die Zahlen rund um die neue Finanzverwaltung noch simuliert und ausgewertet werden, könnte diese die sofortige Vollfinanzierung des Particl-Teams zu den aktuellen Preisen ermöglichen und genügend Mittel für verschiedene Budgets bereitstellen, die auf die Unterstützung und Förderung des Projekts sowie die Erhöhung des Nutzerwachstums ausgerichtet sind.</p><p>Da die neue Finanzmittelbeschaffung wesentlich vom Staking und dem Preis von PART abhängt, kann eine etwaige Erhöhung des PART-Preises ebenfalls dazu beitragen, dass zusätzliche Mittel zur Verfügung stehen, um das Team zu erweitern und Kampagnen zu initiieren, die die Bekanntheit und Nutzerbasis des Particl Marketplace vergrößern und ggf. auch Listings bei anderen Kryptobörsen  ermöglichen. </p><p>Es sollte jedoch eingeschränkt werden, dass eine Erweiterung des Teams erst möglich sein wird, wenn wir wieder eine stabile Struktur innerhalb des Particl-Teams etabliert haben. Eine Erweiterung ist grundsätzlich ein zeitaufwendiger Prozess, der erst in Betracht gezogen wird, wenn es die Zeit erlaubt.</p><p>Als eine Folge der neuen Finanzmittelbeschaffung könnte das Particl Projekt bald wieder in alter Stärke auftrumpfen, womöglich sogar etwas stärker als gewohnt. Wir erwarten, dass sowohl die Entwicklung selbst als auch die öffentliche Kommunikation deutlich verbessert werden können und dabei weder Transparenz, Marketing, eine Steigerung der Nutzerbasis, Werbemaßnahmen und viele andere Initiativen auf der Strecke bleiben. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, Particl nicht nur kurzfristig, sondern vor allem für die Zukunft aufzustellen.</p><h3 id=\"die-finanzmittelbeschaffung-als-ccs-proposal\">Die Finanzmittelbeschaffung als CCS Proposal</h3><p>Das Particl-Team arbeitet zurzeit daran, eine bessere Benutzerschnittstelle (UI) für das sogenannte on-Chain Abstimmungsverfahren fertigzustellen. Dieses soll in den kommenden 1-2 Wochen fertig sein. Es wird uns erlauben, die Vorschläge ansprechend zu visualisieren und das Abstimmungsverfahren einzubauen.</p><p>Da das neue Finanzmittelbeschaffungsmodell die Staking-Rewards sowie den Anteil, der für die Entwicklung und weitere Werbemaßnahmen reserviert ist, anhebt, liegt die oberste Priorität darin, dass die Particl-Community hierzu abstimmt und auf der Protokoll-Ebene zu einer Einigung in der Sache kommt.</p><p>Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt besteht darin, Prozesse deutlich transparenter zu gestalten. Das bedeutet, dass die Finanzmittelverwaltung ebenfalls via on-Chain Abstimmung bestätigt wird. <strong>Jedes Quartal wird deshalb seitens des Particl-Teams ein CCS Vorschlag unterbreitet, der daraufhin von der Particl-Community auf der Protokoll-Ebene bestätigt oder abgelehnt wird</strong>. Salopp formuliert soll dieser Prozess sicherstellen, dass die Particl-Community das letzte Wort darüber hat, in welche Richtung es geht. Dabei sollen Transparenz, Dezentralisierung und Governance (Kontroll- und Steuerungsstruktur) die Eckpfeiler darstellen, um das Particl-Team rechenschaftspflichtig gegenüber der Community zu machen und stets im besten Interesse des gesamten Ökosystem zu handeln.</p><p>Weitere Informationen zu diesem wegweisenden Schritt in die Zukunft von Particl werden in einem weiteren Blogpost zeitnah veröffentlicht. Hier werden dann auch die genauen Details, Zahlen und alle weiteren wichtigen Informationen und Gedanken zum Proposal (Vorschlag) der neuen Finanzverwaltung kommuniziert. </p><h1 id=\"atomic-swaps-im-particl-desktop\">Atomic Swaps im Particl Desktop</h1><p>Doch das ist noch nicht alles. In den letzten Monaten wurde an einem Überraschungs-Projekt gearbeitet, das wir heute offiziell zeigen. Dank eines neuen Particl basierten Austauschprotokolls, kommen Atomic Swaps direkt in den Particl Desktop.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg 1000w, /glink/2021/03/Particl_BasicSwap_v1_crz.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em><em>Early Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Teconvert, unser Particl Core Entwickler, hat <em><em>BasicSwap</em> </em>entworfen, ein anonymes DEX-Protokoll, dass es mittels SMSG erlaubt, anonym und ohne dritte Erfüllungsgehilfen Kryptowährungen durch Atomic Swaps zu tauschen. BasicSwap funktioniert einwandfrei und wurde in einer geschlossenen Beta-Testphase bereits seit Wochen ausprobiert. Das <strong>DEX-Prokoll unterstützt momentan<strong> Particl, Monero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin</strong></strong>, und macht den Handel mit Kryptowährungen widerstandsfähiger und vor allem für jeden zugänglich.</p><p>BasicSwap nutzt Particls SMSG P2P-Netzwerk und ein eigenes Atomic Swap-Protokoll, dass es euch ermöglicht, Kryptowährungen direkt zu tauschen, ohne dass dabei eine weitere Partei benötigt wird oder andere \"Wrapped Coins\" zum Einsatz kommen. Die Swaps werden relativ schnell durchgeführt, sodass ein Tausch zwischen PART und LTC (oder auch PART und XMR) zwischen 20-25 Minuten benötigt. Die individuell benötigte Zeit für den kompletten Vorgang variiert und hängt von den Block-Bestätigungszeiten der jeweiligen Kryptowährungen ab. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png 1000w, /glink/2021/03/pasted-image-0.png 1391w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em><em>Completed Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Um das alles so einfach wie möglich zu gestalten, <strong>wird BasicSwap direkt in den Particl Desktop integriert</strong>.

Obwohl die aktuelle Situation dazu geführt hat, dass dieses Projekt nicht an erster Stelle in Tecnoverts Aufgabenliste steht, erwarten wir, dass BasicSwap die neue Mittelbereitstellung (die wir weiter oben vorgestellt haben) noch weiter verbessert.</p><h1 id=\"ein-neuer-ccs-vorschlag\">Ein neuer CCS Vorschlag</h1><p>Vor einigen Wochen wurde eine neuer CCS Vorschlag von ffmad (Community-Mitglied) vorgestellt, der die Entwicklung einer <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">Market API</a> (Particl V3) Dokumentation zum Ziel hat.

Das hat hängt besonders damit zusammen, dass ein Großteil der Entwicklung am Marketplace hinter verschlossenen Türen aka privaten Repos stattgefunden hat. Das hatte zur Folge, dass nur ein äußerst kleiner Teil des Fortschritts öffentlich auf Github einsehbar war. Als Fork von Bitcoin kommt Particl dennoch in den Genuss den Fortschritt und die Arbeit der Entwicklergemeinde an Bitcoin zu integrieren und und für Particls Codebasis zu übernehmen.</p><p>Tecnovert ist Particls Versicherung dafür, dass die Codebasis von Particl immer mit Bitcoin standhält. Dass das jedoch kein einfaches Kopieren ist, sollte allen klar sein, da die Updates sorgfältig modifiziert und mit Particls Blockchain harmonisiert werden müssen, ohne dabei irgendwelche Probleme und Bugs zu kreieren. Diese Arbeit spiegelt sich in dem von CryptoMiso jährlich herausgegebenen Ranking aller Github Commits wider. Particl liegt auf einem äußerst respektablen 5. Platz in den vergangenen 12 Monaten, ohne dabei überhaupt alle Entwicklungsfortschritte, die in nicht-öffentlichen Repos oder an BasicSwap stattgefunden haben, hinzu zu zählen.</p><hr><h1 id=\"the-best-is-yet-to-come\">The Best is Yet to Come</h1><p>Auch wenn die aktuelle Situation nicht einfach erscheint, schauen wir zuversichtlich in die Zukunft von Particl und sind uns sicher, dass wir mit den hier skizzierten Schritten das Ruder umreißen und die bis dato erfolgreichste Zeit des Particl Projects einleiten können.</p><p>The best is yet to come!

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
