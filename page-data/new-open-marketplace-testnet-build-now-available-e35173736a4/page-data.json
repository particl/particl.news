This time, it is also\naccompanied by a testnet bug bounty that will reward you for finding bugs\nrelated to the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nEver since the last testnet build of the Open Marketplace on the 10th of July,\nthe Particl team has not only been very busy integrating RingCT into the escrow\nsystem of the marketplace but also fixing a market start-up and switching issue\nidentified earlier last week. It is with great excitement that it can be\nannounced today that the testnet build is now ready for public testing and will \nmove up onto mainnet on the 12th of August, 2019!\n\nGet Started!\nDownload and get started with testing the Open Marketplace by following this\nGithub link:\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha2-testnet]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

For those of you that have tested the marketplace on testnet before, please\n    do remember that you will need to wipe your existing marketplace database,\n    otherwise, you may encounter errors that will break your experience. The\n    location of your particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New Since Last Time?\nNew Features\n * Fully anonymous escrow support, powered by RingCT\n * Added the ability to support free shipping\n * Added text to the help sections on the buy and sell page to indicate to users\n   that their wallets need to be unlocked to process buy flow messages\n * Error message dialog for when proposal creation fails\n\nChanges to Existing Features\n * On the top bar of the listings, buy and sell pages, the available Anon\n   balance of your wallet is displayed\n * “Spendable” and “Locked” on the Overview page is now a summary of all\n   balances\n * Instead of the balance transfer label on the Overview page, the transaction\n   type is now displayed (i.e. Converted to blind)\n * Added the ability to copy the text in the console window\n\nFixed Issues & Bugs\n * Cold staking Zap functionality\n * Converting between public and private balances\n * When converting between balances and selecting the Make payment button, a\n   popup will be displayed to unlock your wallet if it is encrypted. You then\n   need to confirm the transaction. If you click away from the popup, it will\n   disappear and the Make payment button will remain greyed out\n * Flagging of listings with 1 UTXO now works properly. Before the fix, it would\n   show as flagged but not be removed from your Listings page\n * Validation added that the balance transfer fee is subtracted from the amount\n   requested\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarn PART by Participating in the Bug Bounty\nSince this build is the version of the marketplace that’s going to move up onto\nmainnet, it is this time accompanied by a bug bounty where you stand to earn\nPART coins for finding any bug related to the marketplace. This ensures that as\nmany testers as possible can try to break, hack into, or find vulnerabilities in\nthe Particl Open Marketplace before it launches and gets used with real funds.\n\nTo find all the details about this bug bounty, as well as the prizes, follow the\nlink below.\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Testnet Bug Bounty\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple: Download\nthe latest testnet build of the Open…\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\n\nWhat’s Next?\nSince this is the final round of testing before the Particl Open Marketplace\nmoves up onto mainnet, the following days are going to be packed as the team\nprepares the Open Marketplace for its grand mainnet launch.

This bug bounty rewards testers in PART for\ntrying to break the Open Marketplace, one last time, before it goes onto mainnet\nand gets used with real funds.

This permanent bounty is aimed at rewarding users who find bugs,\nexploits, or vulnerabilities in the Particl code to securely disclose issues and\nget promptly rewarded for their hard work.

This will effectively decide what keys are going to be used once the\nfirst mainnet build of the Particl Open Marketplace will get compiled, and will\ngive Particl Desktop 2.0 its marketplace functionality.\n\nAugust 8th, 2019\nThe Particl Open Marketplace testnet bug bounty will end. The Particl developers\nwill then continue working to fix the identified bugs, if any, for the next few\nhours/days. On the same day, the set of Market Keys selected by the community\nwill be integrated into the codebase of the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nAugust 9th, 2019 - August 12th, 2019\nDuring this period of 4 days, the Particl development team will fix any\nidentified bugs and compile internal builds running on both testnet and mainnet\nto conduct the last round of internal testing.

This is when the\nParticl Open Marketplace releases on mainnet, at 12:00:00 UTC. This is the\nmoment everybody’s been waiting for, and it’s just around the corner. Indeed, on\nthis day, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be pushed, with marketplace functionality,\nonto mainnet as a public release.\n\nThis will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services using\ncryptocurrencies in a way that preserves your digital privacy and personal data.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team Gets Shuffled\nBut wait, there’s more! Because the project is now in the middle of a phase\nswitch, the Particl team is getting reshuffled to focus more on Particl adoption\nand community building. This means a few members of the team are getting new\nroles and opportunities.\n\nParticl Gets a New Community Manager\nAugust 1st also marks the day where Particl gets a new Community Manager!\nIndeed, Guillaume Benayoun, most commonly known as Ben within the Particl\ncommunity, will join the team’s ranks as Particl’s Community Manager and\nAmbassador.\n\nBen has been a very active member ever since the very beginning of Particl and\nhas almost single-handedly built the Particl FR community. Ben is also behind \nParticl’s evening of presentations at CoinHouse\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a],\nParis, which took place on the 21st of February 2019. Click the links below to\nwatch the three presentations made on this evening.\n\n * Cold Staking & Cold Staking Pools, by Guillaume Benayoun\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crzskSfKTWk]\n * The Evolution of Global eCommerce, by Lina Seiche\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQrDPzUGYaY]\n * The Role of Intermediaries in Blockchain eCommerce, by Albin Cauderlier\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfUTKTSL2-I]\n\nAs part of his new role within the Particl team, Ben will work on growing the\nmain Particl community and make it more engaging. He will ensure there is always\na team member available to answer questions, moderate the community, and keep\nthe channels clean. Additionally, he will also help on user onboarding and the\ncreation of sub-communities to drive up the adoption of the Particl Open\nMarketplace. As with any other member of the Particl communications team, he\nwill also help in a lot of other areas touching communications.\n\nCryptoguard Gets a New Role\nCryptoguard, Particl’s former Community Manager, will now assume a more strategy\nand communications-focused role within the Particl team. He will take on some of\nPaul Schmitzer’s role in managing communications and crafting the strategies\nsurrounding it. He will still be around the community and work full-time on the\nproject, but this new position will probably mean he will have a more “in the\nbackground” role. Cryptoguard has started working on these new responsibilities\na while ago, hence why getting a new Community Manager that would be entirely\nfocused on the community was necessary.\n\nPaul Schmitzer Gets a New Role\nAs part of this reshuffling on the communications team, Paul Schmitzer will take\non a more strategic and partnership-focused role, assisting Imran in doing some\nof that. Paul’s new position will be mostly focused on contacting people, help\nto form new partnerships and relationships, and managing the communications\nstrategy on a higher level.\n\nLina Seiche Leaves the Project\nLina Seiche, former Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist for Particl,\nis unfortunately leaving the project in favor of a new job offer she’s received.\nWe would like to thank Lina for her work with Particl and wish her all the best\nwith her future endeavors!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is with great excitement that we step within this final pre-mainnet phase.\nWith a few years behind our backs, it is now time to let the world know about\nthe wonders of Particl and its Open Marketplace.\n\nSo get prepared, get your computers ready for testing, and let’s revolutionize\nthe world of eCommerce together!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update/1-kxHpRkWtmo3WsOgNQlqWUg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"toward-the-mainnet-release-of-the-particl-open-marketplace\">Toward the Mainnet Release of the Particl Open Marketplace</h3><p>The gears are turning, and ever since the Market Key Generation Contest was announced on the 26th of July, the process of bringing the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet is now well in motion!</p><p>This blog post is going to be an important one — it will give you all the information you need to know about what’s coming up as well as the remaining steps before the Open Marketplace moves onto mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-road-to-mainnet\">The Road to Mainnet</h2><p>It is finally here! <strong>The Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet on the 12th of August!</strong></p><p>Ever since the 16th of July, we have entered in the final mile of the marathon that is the mainnet launch of the Particl Open Marketplace.

On top of this, the team\nwill also be giving away one (1) free limited edition t-shirt to every\nparticipant of this contest.\n\nLet’s first understand what this contest and giveaway are all about: the\ncreation and selection of market keys to be used as the default market on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * What are Market Keys?\n * Create a Set of Market Keys\n * Submit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Contest Prizes\n * Contest Rules\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Market Keys?\nTo understand market keys, we need to refer back to the difference between user\nmarkets and the main interface of the Open Marketplace.\n\nMarket Keys are similar to PART address keys. There is a private and public key\nthat identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets\nwithin Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and\nsell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl\nOpen Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable\nby all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these\nmarkets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell\nitems on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown\nto everyone without the private key.\n\nWhen installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the\nlistings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface\nof the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate\nlistings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user\nmarkets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.\n\nThese markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into\nyour local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the\nOpen Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase,\nor moderate any listing it contains.\n\nThere isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default\ninterface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can\nbe used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only\nperceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is\na market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to\nmanually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user\nmarkets need to be manually connected to.\n\n> The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user\nmarket. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the\nmain interface. —Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/]\nAs you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nrequires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default. And\nwhile no extra step is required by the user to connect to the main interface of\nthe marketplace, this “connection” still need to be made before a new version of\nthe Open Marketplace is pushed publicly.\n\n> Note: It is not required to generate a key to use the Particl Open Marketplace.\nWhen downloading and installing Particl Desktop 2.0 or higher, it will come\npre-packaged with a market key already linked to the client.\nAnd to do just that, an entity has to generate and choose what market keys will\nbe used to host the main market of the Open Marketplace. This is where the\ncommunity comes in…\n\nHow to Generate and Submit Market Keys\nWhile the Particl team is building the Open Marketplace protocol, it doesn’t own\nor has any sort of control over the network itself. It is entirely up to the\ncommunity of users to run and govern it. That also means generating and choosing\nwhat set of market keys is going to be used to display the main interface of the\nmarketplace will be a 100% community-led process.\n\n> Note: Generating a set of market keys does not give you any special access,\npermission, or power over the market. Everyone that installs the Open\nMarketplace has equal rights and oversight over the generated market. This is\nnot a trusted setup.\nIndeed, the Particl team is inviting everyone to generate a set of market keys\nof their own and submit it on Github by creating a pull request in the\nappropriate repository. Doing so is pretty simple and straight-forward.\n\nCreate a Set of Market Keys\n * Visit this website to generate a pair of keys: \n   https://walletgenerator.net/?currency=Particl\n\n> **Even better, download the app to your local machine and follow these steps\noffline**\n * Move your cursor randomly on the screen until the website automatically gives\n   you both a public address and a private key\n * Copy both keys\n\nSubmit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Open another tab, and go to the particl-market repository on Github: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-market/\n * Log into your Github account or create a new one\n * Fork the particl-market repository by clicking the Fork button at the top\n   right corner of the page\n * Wait for the repository to fork on your account\n * Once the screen automatically updates, you should now see that you are now on \n   https://github.com/your_username/particl-market\n   [https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market] instead of \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-market\n   [https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market]\n * Scroll down a little and click on the .env.dist file\n * Edit the file by clicking on the pen icon (Edit this file) at the top right\n   corner of the text editor\n * Scroll down to line 26 and 27\n * Replace the variable on line 26 with the private key you’ve just generated:\n   DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_PRIVATE_KEY=2Zc2pc9jSx2qF5tpu25DCZEr1Dwj8JBoVL5WP4H1drJsX9sP4ek\n * Delete the # at the beginning of the line\n * Replace the variable on line 27 with the public address you’ve generated:\n   DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=pmktyVZshdMAQ6DPbbRXEFNGuzMbTMkqAA\n * Delete the # at the beginning of the line\n * Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and put Default Market Key Submission\n   as the title of the commit. There should already be a greyed out title that\n   says Update .env.dist, just overwrite it.\n * Click the green Commit changes button to save the file\n * Go back to the main particl-market folder by clicking on particl-market at\n   the top of your screen\n * Create your pull request by clicking on the small Pull request button located\n   just under the Clone or download green button on the top right corner of the\n   page\n * On the next page that shows up, make sure there is a green text that says\n   Able to merge.\n * Click on the green Create pull request button to create your pull request\n * Before officially submitting your market keys, you can add any comment or\n   message you want for the community to see in the next page that comes up.\n   This message can help the community make its choice on which market keys it\n   wants to pick\n * Click on Create pull request to officially submit your pull request, thus\n   successfully submitting your keys to be picked by the community as the\n   default market keys of the Particl Open Marketplace ?\n\nContest Prizes\n * 1 Trezor hardware device given away to 3 random people who submit market keys\n * 1 free limited edition t-shirt to every person who submits market keys\n\nContest Rules\n * Market keys submissions will be accepted until the 5th of August, 14:00:00\n   UTC\n * Community voting starts on the 5th of August and will last until the 7th of\n   August.\n * Only 1 submission per participant is allowed\n * Pull requests that are not properly submitted or contain other code\n   modifications will be ignored\n * Both line 26 and 27 need to be uncommented, meaning the line cannot start\n   with #\n\n> Correct formatting: DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=YOURKEYIncorrect formatting:\n#DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=YOURKEY\n\nHow to Vote\nThe community voting process will be held from the 5th of August to the 7th of\nAugust. To let as many people vote as possible, both Particl’s Twitter page and\nthe Particl forum will be used to collect votes. This is to ensure as many\npeople as possible can give their input on which key should be picked. More\ndetails will be announced later on.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow’s the time for you to be part of Particl’s history!

There is a private and public key that identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets within Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and sell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl Open Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable by all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these markets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell items on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown to everyone without the private key.</p><p>When installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the listings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface of the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate listings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user markets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.</p><p>These markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into your local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the Open Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase, or moderate any listing it contains.</p><p>There isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default interface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can be used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only perceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is a market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to manually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user markets need to be manually connected to.</p><blockquote>The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user market. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the main interface. — <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/\">Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer</a></blockquote><p>As you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace requires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default. And while no extra step is required by the user to connect to the main interface of the marketplace, this “connection” still need to be made before a new version of the Open Marketplace is pushed publicly.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> It is not required to generate a key to use the Particl Open Marketplace.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all.
