This\nweek, we've got some exciting news to share we're sure you'll love in regards to\nParticl Desktop 3.2, so let's not waste time and get to it right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've finally completed the integration of the new messaging system\ninto Particl Marketplace! This new feature lets sellers and buyers (or potential\nbuyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form. \n\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new update introduces user messaging in two different ways. On one end,\neach listing now has a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to\nthe seller. All messages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable,\nmeaning anyone can see current and past messages sent this way. This function is\nlikely to replace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get\nyour feedback and thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet\nround.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\nAt this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make\nit possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use\nParticl Marketplace.\n\nPrivate in-order conversation between a seller and a buyerWith the messaging\nsystem now ready for the marketplace, we are currently looking at a few minor\nissues raised within the last few days and, if there's any fix required, they'll\nbe included in Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nBarring any issue stemming from the current round of internal testing, we'll be\nready to release Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet within the next 24 to 72 hours.\nThen, if all goes well, we'll be able to release it, on mainnet, a few days\nafter that.\n\nAs always, we highly encourage you to come and help us test this new major\nParticl Desktop release to ensure that no edge case or environment-specific\nissue is missed by the team. Additionally, as we've mentioned just a bit above,\nwe're also curious about your feedback regarding the deprecation of the Reviews\nfunctionality in favor of public chatrooms within listing pages.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nNew Particl Core Version ✅\nRelease Particl Core 0.21.2.9 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129Hashes56c899c09cb11948c9b81e92ff2599fbcf8cd18b10fd3e708064d37b1b1c4bbd\nparticl-0.21.2.9-aarch64...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]Earlier this\nweek, we pre-released Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9], a release\nfocused on network stability, on Github. It includes a variety of SMSG network\nimprovements and also improves the stability of the blockchain's connectivity by\nbanning misbehaving peers more effectively. Follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129] \nfor the full list of changes.\n\nWhile this is still marked as a pre-release, meaning your cold staking nodes\nwon't update automatically through Partyman, we encourage you to install this\nnew version and report back to the team should you encounter any issues. It will\nbe marked as a full release shortly.\n\nParticl Electrum ✅\nRelease 4.2.1.5 Particl · tecnovert/electrum\nHashesdb67abb00dc575a4270c88cbd36105ae72355f7edc1c21830865fd8f9769afcb\nElectrumParticl-4.2.1.5-arm64-v8a-release.apkf8df945d44de292395cdc20452931fa12d2fd2a1fa9352a794e76be74ab8da15\nElectrumPart...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl]We've also\npushed a minor cosmetic fix\n[https://github.com/particl/electrum/commit/f1b8c13636c9ffcf6fd37a03340d4eff2d7f0354] \nto Particl Electrum mobile which changes the display of staking transactions\nfrom a negative fee to a correctly marked staking reward.\n\nTo that effect, we pushed, a few hours ago, new mobile builds (.apk) for Android\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl] that fix\nthis issue.\n\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute\nto particl/particl-core development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]As usual,\nvarious code adaptions and merges have been done as part of our ever-ongoing\nprocess of keeping Particl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You\ncan always keep track of those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nAs a reminder, while this task may appear \"mundane\" on the surface, it is vital\nfor the deployment of certain functionalities that are critical to the success\nof our ecosystem. \n\nFor example, Taproot, which is now available on Particl, is poised to become an\nimportant feature of the upcoming BasicSwap DEX. By not keeping the Particl Core\ncodebase up-to-date with the ongoing Bitcoin developments, integrating such a\nmajor feature would not only be very messy and time-consuming, but it would also\npotentially be unsafe as it would be missing important dependencies.\n\nWhat keeping up with the Bitcoin codebase allows Particl to do is to leverage\nall the new exciting updates, features, and functionalities of Bitcoin and\nintegrate them, when and if needed, into our wider ecosystem in a timely and\nsafe manner.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe do not have anything in particular to mention this week on BasicSwap other\nthan what was mentioned in last week's report. We are still working on\nfinalizing the DEX's user interface and it is the current main focus of our\ndesigner and lead UI/UX, Gerlof van Ek.\n\nExclusive Episode of the Super Dangerous Club\nYou're probably already aware of the Super Dangerous Club, the weekly show by\nParticl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe Fisher. They talk about\nvarious topics touching on technology, geo-politics, futurism, and more. \n\nLast week, they focused their episode on the Particl project and Particl\nMarketplace. If you're a fan of Particl, then this one is an episode you must\nnot skip.\n\nWhile the episode itself is not yet released anywhere other than on Clubhouse,\nwe thought of sharing it here in advance for our weekly progress update readers\nonly.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms.

You can always keep track of those changes by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\">this link</a></strong>.</p><p>As a reminder, while this task may appear \"mundane\" on the surface, it is vital for the deployment of certain functionalities that are critical to the success of our ecosystem. </p><p>For example, Taproot, which is now available on Particl, is poised to become an important feature of the upcoming BasicSwap DEX. By not keeping the Particl Core codebase up-to-date with the ongoing Bitcoin developments, integrating such a major feature would not only be very messy and time-consuming, but it would also potentially be unsafe as it would be missing important dependencies.</p><p>What keeping up with the Bitcoin codebase allows Particl to do is to leverage all the new exciting updates, features, and functionalities of Bitcoin and integrate them, when and if needed, into our wider ecosystem in a timely and safe manner.</p><h3 id=\"basicswap-\">BasicSwap ?</h3><p>We do not have anything in particular to mention this week on BasicSwap other than what was mentioned in last week's report.

the time of our weekly\nprogress update. \n\nThis week has been a positive and interesting one with the release of the\nParticl Desktop 3.2 on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-testnet/] and we'd like to report on\nhow this testing round is going and on what else we've been working on as we\napproach the long-anticipated release of this desktop client update on mainnet.\n\nSo let's jump right into it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nParticl Desktop 3.2 Testnet is LiveThe long-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.2\nupdate is now publicly available on testnet!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-testnet/]As mentioned, earlier this\nweek, we've released Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001] to allow\nfor community-wide testing of the new client before it hits mainnet.\n\nWe can happily report that no significant issue has been found by the community\nyet in any of the new features and functionality introduced by the new update.\nHowever, we are currently investigating an OS-specific display/launch issue\nobserved in Manjaro and potentially some Fedora environments as well. The\ninvestigation is still underway and the issue is intended to be fixed for the\nmainnet launch of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nOther than testnet-related matters, we've started preparing and setting things\nup for the development cycle of Particl Desktop 3.3. This upcoming cycle will\nfocus on improving the back-end code of the desktop application, as opposed to\nadding new features to the wallet or marketplace, and will lay very important\ngroundwork for the next major phase of the Particl ecosystem. We'll communicate\nmore information about this next major phase, which aims at dramatically\nimproving Particl's potential for adoption, shortly in a blog post dedicated to\nthat topic coming soon to Particl News [particl.news].\n\nBut what we can say now, in regards to Particl Desktop 3.3, is that it will\nimprove the desktop's application level of privacy and security as well as give\nusers more control over the way they want to use the desktop client. This will\nbe reflected, for example, by better integrating the Tor network, or by adding\nmore user-defined configuration, among other similar back-end improvements. \n\nStay tuned for more information about what Particl Desktop 3.3 will bring and\nwhat the next major development phase will bring to the Particl ecosystem as a\nwhole (hint: not exclusively desktop-focused ?). \n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort in\nmaintaining Particl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. And this\nweek, this process has taken a particularly good amount of time. You can always\nkeep track of those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. \n\nNote that, in the past, we've referred you to look at Particl's \"Particl Core\"\nrepository to track core updates. But if you've had a look at it this week,\nyou've probably noticed that no code was pushed. That's because new updates are\nonly merged periodically while the bleeding edge stuff stays on a private\nrepository.\n\nIndeed, if you really want to keep track, in real-time, of the progress being\nmade on Particl Core, then the absolute best way to do it is by tracking Particl\ncore developer Tecnovert's private repository here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. There, you can see\nall the code updates being made to Particl Core even before they get officially\nmerged into the official repository. For the Particl addicts, that's the\nrepository to follow!\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAside from the core codebase maintenance, the remaining of this week's efforts\non Tecnovert's end has gone towards researching and exploring various features,\nnew capabilities, and potential new coin integrations for the BasicSwap DEX. \n\nHowever, we don't have much to report in terms of concrete deliverable for the\nweek as most of that time has been spent on research, exploration of\npossibilities, and testing. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving. None of it would be possible without you\nall!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend we'll see you all back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

In fact, cold staking pools that were using\nmulti-signature addresses (i.e., coldstakingpool.com\n[https://coldstakingpool.com]) had been affected by a bug that prevented the\nautomated distribution of staking rewards after the release of Particl Core\n0.19.2.19. \n\nThis bug has been resolved yesterday, cold staking pools operators have been\nnotified of the fix, and rewards have already been successfully distributed to\nstakers that are staking on pools that have since then made the update. The\napplied fix has for bonus effect to make cold staking pools significantly\nfaster.

to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
