thrilled to announce a major milestone: the initial phase of integrating\nLitecoin MWEB into BasicSwap DEX. With this latest update, users now have the\nability to send MWEB transactions to MWEB deposit addresses on BasicSwap and\neffortlessly convert coins between standard and MWEB balances.\n\nThis integration marks the first step in our commitment to fully integrate\nLitecoin MWEB atomic swaps into BasicSwap DEX. We are closely following\nLitecoin's upcoming major update — which is required for a full integration of\nMWEB swaps — and plan to incorporate full MWEB swaps as soon as feasible. \n\nOur goal is to support innovation in the cryptocurrency space, especially in\nregards to privacy, data protection, and pro-freedom initiatives, and we are\nconfident that adding Litecoin's MWEB capabilities to our DEX will go a long way\nin making this important privacy contribution from the Litecoin community more\naccessible to a wider audience. \n\nTable of Contents\n * How to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\n * Providing Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\n * (Contest) Win a Physical Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)\n * Dr. Kap to Speak at the Litecoin Summit 2024\n * About Litecoin's MWEB\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\nTo begin using Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap, you need to either install the DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html] \non your computer or update it to the latest version\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n. Detailed instructions for installation and updating can be found at the \nParticl Academy [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/index.html].\n\n> Note: If you're using Windows, you can use our all-in-one .exe installer here\n[https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI] which fully\nautomates the process: \nhttps://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases (latest\ninstaller version)\nOnce installed, navigate to the Wallets page on the DEX where you'll see all the\ncoins you've enabled. To manage your Litecoin wallet, click on the 'Manage\nWallet' button at the top right corner of the Litecoin tile. There, you'll find\nboth your standard and MWEB Litecoin deposit addresses. You can send your coins\nto these addresses as needed.\n\nTo switch coins between standard and MWEB balances, simply make a withdrawal\nfrom one address type to the other. This will create an internal transaction,\neffectively converting your balance between the two states.\n\nFor example, to transfer coins from your standard deposit address to your MWEB\naddress, simply copy and paste your MWEB address into the LTC address field,\nenter the number of LTC you want to transfer, and click on the Withdraw LTC\nbutton.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProviding Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\nWhile full MWEB swaps aren't yet an option on BasicSwap, you still have the\nability to swap Litecoin using either the Secret Hash method or the more\nprivacy-centric Adaptor Signature protocol for atomic swaps. This means you can\ntrade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX,\nincluding Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.\n\nTo make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a \ncompanion automated market making script\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts]. This tool runs in\ntandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book\nonce they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market\nrate. \n\nAdditionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers\nwith a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for\npassive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.\n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the\ncompanion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is\nextremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your\ncomputer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your\npersonal computer.\n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in\noffsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other\npeople pick up your swap offers.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThe second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This\nallows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated\nmanner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\nand add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential passive\nincome whenever others pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node and providing liquidity to Litecoin pairs entirely effortless\nonce the initial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy\nthe market making script, and earn some sweet passive income as people enjoy\nyour liquidity for their swapping needs.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)\nTo celebrate the launch of Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX — the world's safest,\ncheapest and most anonymous decentralized exchange — we're giving away five (5) \n2013 Lealana 1 Litecoin “First Run” bullions, valued at approximately $1,000\neach\n[https://stacksbowers.com/cryptocurrency/litecoin-ltc/#:~:text=Overview%3A%20The%20Lealana%20Litecoin%20series,physical%20bitcoins%20introduced%20in%202011]\n.\n\nTo participate, simply (1) place a bid on the contest listing on Particl's\ndecentralized marketplace dApp (listing title: Particl x Litecoin MWEB Contest),\n(2) like and retweet the contest tweet, and (3) tag three of your friends in the\ntweet's comments section.

Derived from the name 'MimbleWimble' originating from the\nHarry Potter series, this protocol was initially proposed by an anonymous user\nnamed Tom Elvis Jedusor in a Bitcoin research chatroom, signaling its roots in\nthe broader crypto community.\n\nTechnically, MWEB is distinct because it fundamentally alters how transactions\nare constructed in Litecoin's blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain models,\nwhere individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions\ninto a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential\ntransactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted.\nThe encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the\ntransaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel\napproach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to\nobscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.\n\nThe benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly\nenhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by\nobscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark\ncontrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin,\nwhere transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves\nscalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using\ncryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store\nexcessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the\nnetwork. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making\nLitecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

To manage your Litecoin wallet, click on the 'Manage Wallet' button at the top right corner of the Litecoin tile. There, you'll find both your standard and MWEB Litecoin deposit addresses. You can send your coins to these addresses as needed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/01/01---litecoin_bsxob.png\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1960\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/01---litecoin_bsxob.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/01---litecoin_bsxob.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/01---litecoin_bsxob.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/01/01---litecoin_bsxob.png 1960w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/01/02---wallets_page_ltc-1.png\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1960\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/02---wallets_page_ltc-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/02---wallets_page_ltc-1.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/02---wallets_page_ltc-1.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/01/02---wallets_page_ltc-1.png 1960w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/01/03---litecoinmweb_wallet_page_bsx-1.png\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1960\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/03---litecoinmweb_wallet_page_bsx-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/03---litecoinmweb_wallet_page_bsx-1.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/03---litecoinmweb_wallet_page_bsx-1.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/01/03---litecoinmweb_wallet_page_bsx-1.png 1960w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div></figure><p>To switch coins between standard and MWEB balances, simply make a withdrawal from one address type to the other. This will create an internal transaction, effectively converting your balance between the two states.</p><p>For example, to transfer coins from your standard deposit address to your MWEB address, simply copy and paste your MWEB address into the LTC address field, enter the number of LTC you want to transfer, and click on the Withdraw LTC button.</p><hr><h2 id=\"providing-liquidity-to-litecoin-pairs\">Providing Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs</h2><p>While full MWEB swaps aren't yet an option on BasicSwap, you still have the ability to swap Litecoin using either the Secret Hash method or the more privacy-centric Adaptor Signature protocol for atomic swaps. This means you can trade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX, including Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.</p><p>To make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts\">companion automated market making script</a>. This tool runs in tandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book once they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market rate. </p><p>Additionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers with a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for passive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.</p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the companion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other people pick up your swap offers.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This allows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated manner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.</p><p>What's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices and add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential passive income whenever others pick up your offers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jym-h6E4Vqk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Automated Market Making on BasicSwap DEX | Anonymously Earn Passive Income\"></iframe></figure><p>Combined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated BasicSwap node and providing liquidity to Litecoin pairs entirely effortless once the initial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy the market making script, and earn some sweet passive income as people enjoy your liquidity for their swapping needs.</p><hr><h2 id=\"win-a-physical-lealana-litecoin-worth-1-000-\">Win a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)</h2><p>To celebrate the launch of Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX — the world's safest, cheapest and most anonymous decentralized exchange — we're giving away five (5) <em>2013 Lealana 1 Litecoin “First Run”</em> bullions, <a href=\"https://stacksbowers.com/cryptocurrency/litecoin-ltc/#:~:text=Overview%3A%20The%20Lealana%20Litecoin%20series,physical%20bitcoins%20introduced%20in%202011\">valued at approximately $1,000 each</a>.</p><p>To participate, simply (1) place a bid on the contest listing on Particl's decentralized marketplace dApp (<strong>listing title: Particl x Litecoin MWEB Contest</strong>), (2) like and retweet the contest tweet, and (3) tag three of your friends in the tweet's comments section.

This means you can trade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX, including Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.</p><p>To make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts\">companion automated market making script</a>. This tool runs in tandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book once they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market rate. </p><p>Additionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers with a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for passive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.</p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the companion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other people pick up your swap offers.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up.

For more information and to see the impressive list of speakers, click <strong><a href=\"https://www.litecoin.net/summit\">here</a></strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-litecoin-s-mweb-on-basicswap-dex\">About Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX</h2><p>Litecoin's MWEB protocol is a significant optional enhancement aimed at improving privacy and scalability, two critical aspects in the world of cryptocurrencies. Derived from the name 'MimbleWimble' originating from the Harry Potter series, this protocol was initially proposed by an anonymous user named Tom Elvis Jedusor in a Bitcoin research chatroom, signaling its roots in the broader crypto community.</p><p>Technically, MWEB is distinct because it fundamentally alters how transactions are constructed in Litecoin's blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain models, where individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions into a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential transactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted. The encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the transaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel approach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to obscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.</p><p>The benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly enhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by obscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark contrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin, where transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves scalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store excessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the network. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making Litecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
