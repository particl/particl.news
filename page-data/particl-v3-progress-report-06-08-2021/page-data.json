This week, the focus has yet\nagain been on fixing the remaining issues that were identified in the last\nParticl V3 testnet round.\n\nAs was identified in last week’s report, the team has separated the reported\nissues into two categories; minor issues and more serious ones. We can happily\nreport that all minor issues have been resolved and are either waiting for the\ncode that introduces the fixes to be merged.\n\nThe main priority now lies in fixing the “more serious” issues previously\nidentified. Here’s a status update on each of them.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGracefully Shutting Down the Marketplace\nThe MP service needs a means of gracefully shutting down. Currently, the process\nsimply terminates, which can lead to potential issues in some edge cases.\n\nThere has been a lot of back and forth and iterations for the fix over this\nparticular issue, and a solution has been found. The team is now busy testing\nthe fix properly and tweaking it, as required.\n\nChanging the ZMQ Node Library\nThe ZMQ node library currently being used causes performance issues for some\nusers and specific OSes. Finding a valid fix or alternative library is still an\noutstanding task, but when resolved, it will have the added benefit of making\nParticl Desktop usable on the privacy-centric OS Whonix. This will allow Particl\nV3 to work within a Tor-only environment for maximal privacy.\n\nThis is the next item in line after fixing the “gracefully shutting down the\nmarketplace” item.\n\nListing Template Hashes Not Properly Saved Under Specific Circumstances\nThere's an issue that can occur under a specific set of circumstances where the\nposting of a template removes the template hash, leading to problems with\naccepting bids.\n\nThis is the last item in line and should, unless new issues are identified, be\nthe last one out of the list identified during the last testnet round.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs Another Testnet Round Coming Up?\nDue to the sizable number of issues identified during the last testnet round,\nthe team may issue a new build for one more testing round. This hasn’t been\ndecided yet but is likely.\n\nHowever, how this testnet round would happen is still up for debate. A\nsmaller-in-scope round may be initiated where certain users (those who’ve\nencountered specific issues) receive a build to swiftly verify that the fixes\naddress the highlighted issues without any new issue. Of course, we’ll\ncommunicate the information about this as soon as it’s available!\n\nA Development Update on Non-V3 Related Items\nThe Particl team has also been busy working on other non-V3 items. A new Particl\nCore version will soon be released with a few minor improvements, including a\nsignificant improvement in how the cold staking zap system behaves.\n\nAdditionally, the majority of the work required to make Particl smoothly\ncompatible with the Trezor hardware wallet has been completed. A lot of testing\nand merges on Trezor’s end are still required. Note that the current Trezor\nimplementation supports public transactions, but also blind (CT) and anon\n(RingCT) ones. That’ll mean that it’ll be possible to privately store your PART\non Trezor as soon as the full release is live.\n\nFinally, a lot of focus has also been placed on doing research on new roadmap\nitems and exploring their feasibility. We are finalizing the post-v3 roadmap and\nwill be publishing it after Particl V3 releases on mainnet. It includes a lot of\nexciting items which will go a long way in making Particl much more accessible\nand easy to use. We’re confident that you will be as excited as we are with the\npath we’re taking forward and with the short, mid, and long-term vision for both\nParticl Marketplace and other components of the ecosystem.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’d like to once again thank everyone who's taken the time to properly test\nthis last testnet. Although a good number of issues have been identified, their\nassociated fixes will ensure a V3 mainnet launch that is smooth and without any\nbad bump.\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares. With your help, we become more noticed out\nthere. It takes seconds, and you are making a statement by giving us a follow\nand hitting the bell icon.\n\nYouTube [https://youtube.com/c/particl] Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject] Mastodon [https://fosstodon.org/@particl] \nReddit [https://reddit.com/r/particl]\n\n\nJoin the instant messaging chats.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
