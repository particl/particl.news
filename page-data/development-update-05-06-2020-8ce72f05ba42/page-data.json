It’s safe to say, this new revamped marketplace is bound to\nimpress more than a few heads. Not only will it look much better and be a lot\neasier to use, but it’s performance will also feel like day and night for anyone\nthat has used the marketplace before.\n\nHere is the latest development report from Development Manager Henk Swardt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\n * As most of you are already aware now, a new version of Particl Desktop\n   (2.3.3.) was released a short while ago. This introduced a slightly updated\n   marketplace codebase in order to address a bug experienced in the buyflow\n   when using Particl Core 0.19. While the update and change went well, some\n   problems were encountered during the signing and notarizing of the Mac\n   builds, which delayed the release a little. This, unfortunately, took some\n   time to fix and get working again, but eventually got sorted and we were able\n   to release the builds.\n * The basics of the re-implementation of the listing details view (effectively\n   the modal that is displayed when clicking on a listing) into Particl Desktop\n   has been completed. We’re now using this specific modal in more places now in\n   order to provide details on a particular listing or order wherever it may be\n   necessary to do so. For example, it is now displayed during the buyflow when\n   needing to look over the details of the item ordered without having to jump\n   off the page. This is a common behaviour for most online marketplaces and\n   will now be part of Particl as well.\n * After some discussions and testing around the creation and display of product\n   templates, as well as the publishing of them into marketplace listings, there\n   was a need to modify and re-work some aspects of the way this was being done\n   in the new ‘Sell’ section of the market module in the Particl Desktop. This\n   re-work is currently in progress.\n * A new “Inventory & Products” tab in the ‘Sell’ section has been added. This\n   will act as a central place for your products in stock (which effectively\n   means splitting the Sell > Listings tab into two separate ones).\n * Due to the integration of “infinite markets” and necessary for it, you can\n   now see which inventory items are published on which markets and storefronts.\n   This will also help with Quantity Management in the future, one of Particl’s\n   current roadmap items.\n * A new batch publish feature for pushing created/imported inventory items\n   (Products) on the marketplace is currently being worked on.\n * The “Import Listings” section of Particl Desktop has now become “Import\n   Products” and has been significantly redesigned to be easier to use.\n * The interface and usability of the escrow process and Market modals for\n   pushing Orders to next their next stages (ie. Accept bid, Mark as delivered,\n   etc.) has been redesigned.\n * The Market Overview page has been redesigned to work more as a guidepost or\n   dashboard for a quick overview of the latest activity that has happened since\n   the last visit — clicking on a card will take you directly to the relevant\n   place.\n * The Questions and Answers layout has been globally redesigned and reused at\n   multiple places for easier access (i.e. directly in a Listing’s details and\n   in a dedicated Sell/Buy > Questions & Answers tab).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSneak Peeks\nTo better illustrate some of the changes currently being worked on, here are\nsome live screenshots taken from the latest internal builds. Please keep in mind\neverything showed here is still a work in progress and subject to change before\nthe release.\n\nMarket’s Overview Page\nThe Market’s Overview page will now act as a guidepost or dashboard for getting\na quick but detailed overview of all actions requiring your attention.\n\nReworked Exchange Module\nParticl Desktop’s in-app swap section has been fully isolated from other modules\nand now acts as its own independent module. Coins and exchanges displayed in\nthis screenshot are not announcements of any sort but rather a good\ndemonstration of where this module is headed UI/UX-wise.\n\nQuestions and Answers\nAs mentioned in the Progress Report of this Development Update, the Q/A\nfunctionality has now been integrated into additional pages for easier access.\nUsers will now be notified whenever they receive a new question or answer to a\nlisting and will be able to navigate to it without much hassle.\n\nMarket Settings\nThe Market Settings page allows you to manage market-related settings.

No payment processor, no marketplace operator,\nno bank, no moderator, no data miner, no nothing. Just you, the person you’re\ntransacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent\nscams.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2This total absence of\nthird-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening\nup a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that \nfor-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on\nthe internet. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is\nno one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental,\nespecially when you consider that online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up\nto even 50% for the services they offer. A fee that is naturally reflected in\nthe retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.\n\nAnd more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer\neCommerce in a totally private and anonymous way. In fact, a mix of\nprivacy-preserving protocols such as RingCT, CT, stealth addresses, Tor,\nrock-solid encryption, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of\ndigital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!\n\n> Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIts Evolution Since it Launched\nThe Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its\ninitial mainnet release on the 12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0).\nThese releases have seen the addition of several important features and a\nsignificant improvement in all components.\n\nHere are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace\nsince its release:\n\n * Questions and answers on listings\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Product/inventory import\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Bitcoin payments\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * Bid cancellation\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Listing fee reduction\n   [https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601]\n * Settings [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Many UI/UX improvements\n * Many marketplace codebase improvements\n * Many bug fixes\n\nThere is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/] since its mainnet release. It’s been\nsignificantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch\nof new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.\n\nA Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application\nSince the release of Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] on\nParticl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been\nworking on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —Multi-Markets\n, or “Infinite Markets” as referenced by some in the community.\n\n> Multi-Markets in a NutshellMulti-Markets add the ability to create and join an\ninfinite number of user-created markets and storefronts on the Particl network.\nIt essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide\nnetwork of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/].\n\nInitially, Particl Desktop 2.4.0 was only intended to add the ability to create\nor join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new\nfeature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it turned into a great\nopportunity to make a major leap forward and as a result, became much bigger\nthan anticipated. Here’s why…\n\nRe-Writing Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels\ngood, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto\nwallet. As proof, it has often been forked and adapted by other open-source\nprojects to serve as the main desktop wallet.\n\nBut it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is\nalready almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience\nand knowledge since then.\n\nIt may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of\nthe marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against\nsome of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such\nas multi-markets.\n\nAnd so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both\nthe marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided\nto completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.\n\nAs such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase\nhave been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more\nmodern codebase.\n\nThis is why the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl\nDesktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.\n\nAdding More Features Than Initially Planned\nPreview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0Along the\nway of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of\nthe marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into\nthe new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit,\nbut would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the\nintegration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the\nteam chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.\n\nFor this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer\nthan initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the\nopportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of\ndecentralized online commerce.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0\nParticl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is\ncoming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire\nback-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is,\nquite literally, Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch almost three\nyears ago.\n\nHere are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:\n\nParticl Desktop\n * A much lighter, faster, more responsive and modern desktop application\n * A modular approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine\n   into different and independent modules\n * All modules (including marketplace) enabled by default on first startup\n * Massively improved user interface and user experience, more intuitive and \n   user-friendly\n * An almost uncountable number of bug fixes, improvements, and tweaks to most\n   components of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl\n   community for the valuable feedback ❤ )\n * A complete overhaul of the in-app swap engine interface\n * SDK friendly desktop application\n\nMarketplace Improvements\n * Addition of a brand new marketplace user dashboard with advanced\n   notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account\n * Addition of multi-markets and the ability to create an infinity of markets\n   and storefronts\n * Addition of the Market Browser and the ability to browse and join any\n   user-created market or storefront. It’s also possible to promote markets in\n   the Market Browser.\n * Improvements to Question and Answers section of listings — easier access and\n   more comprehensive notifications\n * Addition of user identities and profiles\n * Addition of custom categories which can be set per market or storefront\n * Massive reduction in listing fees, will be reduced by more than 80% of\n   current cost. The cost of listing a product on Particl will then be well\n   under a cent worth of PART\n * Improvements to how Particl Desktop, the marketplace codebase, and the SMSG\n   network interact with each other\n\n> Note: Because the V2 and V3 versions of Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nso radically different, listings won’t be compatible with each other’s version.\nIn other words, listings published on V3 won’t show up on V2, and vice-versa. Of\ncourse, it’s always possible to revert back to a V2 version of the marketplace\nto complete any outstanding order you may still have.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore to Come After the V3 Release\nThe V3 version of Particl will mark a significant step in Particl’s roadmap\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/] as it will cross off many of its items. It will\nalso serve as the trigger for many other initiatives to come to life.\n\nNew Coins to be Added\nOverhaul of the in-App Swap Engine Interface (Particl Desktop V3)After Particl\nDesktop 3.0 goes live, more cryptocurrencies will be added to the in-app swap\nengine. This will be the best time to show the world what Particl has been up to\nin the last few months and come out with a bang in various cryptocurrency\ncommunities.\n\nEncrypted Messaging System\nCurrently under development by DeMarkets.io [https://demarkets.io/], a\ncompletely distributed, private, and encrypted messaging system will allow you\nto communicate with anyone else in the world. Whether that person is a buyer,\nseller, or just a friend, you’ll be able to exchange secure messages on the\nParticl network. Thanks to all the developers at DeMarkets.io\n[http://DeMarkets.io] for the work they’re putting into this decentralized chat\nsystem! ❤\n\nParticl Academy\nThe Particl Academy is going to be Particl’s main informative hub, the\ninteractive user manual. It contains all the basic information and instructions\nrequired to use Particl to its full extent. It’s also written in a way that\nanyone can understand and is meant to make onboarding new users a much easier\ntask.\n\nVendor Onboarding and Outreach Program\nThe Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program (VOP) is a program designed to help\nmake the process of onboarding new sellers easier and help them make their first\nsteps in the world of decentralized eCommerce. It also provides all the tools\nrequired for anyone to actively participate in reaching out and getting new\nsellers to join Particl.\n\nTo help and support new sellers, the VOP will provide added benefits and perks\nto sellers who opt to register to the program. These include the funding of\nlisting fees, the promotion of markets and storefronts, access to VIP channels,\npersonalized support, more exposure within Particl’s community, and many more\nbenefits. It also provides marketing and informational content to the community\nso that anyone can go out there and find new vendors!\n\nNew Community Voting Mechanism\nThe Partyman cold staking application has recently been updated with some new\nvoting capabilities. This voting system is more private and robust compared to\nthe in-app Proposals system. More details about how to use the voting system and\nhow it will be used to manage the Community Fund will be revealed here on \nParticl.news [http://particl.news] soon.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are still a few weeks separating us from the first Particl Desktop 3.0\nrelease, but it will be well worth the wait!

Just you, the person you’re transacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent scams.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-wDUfOyGBvwgQJyvqAVovFg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2</figcaption></figure><p>This total absence of third-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening up a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that <strong>for-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on the internet</strong>. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is no one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental, especially when you consider that <strong>online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up to even 50% for the services they offer</strong>. A fee that is naturally reflected in the retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.</p><p>And more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer eCommerce in a <strong>totally private and anonymous</strong> way. In fact, a mix of privacy-preserving protocols such as <strong>RingCT</strong>, <strong>CT</strong>, <strong>stealth addresses</strong>, <strong>Tor</strong>, rock-solid <strong>encryption</strong>, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of digital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
