Indeed, forget about the “free”\ninternet of 10 or 15 years ago; a few profit and agenda-driven corporations now\ncontrol the vast majority of the web in ways you might not even expect.\n\nAccording to data by SimilarWeb [https://www.similarweb.com/], over 30% of US\nonline traffic is entirely controlled by five websites. Furthermore, only three\ncompanies share 80% of the cloud hosting of the top 10,000 websites — a trend\nthat is also very worrisome considering the sheer amount of power hosting\nproviders possess\n[https://www.pcmag.com/news/web-hosting-provider-namecheap-to-ban-russia-based-users-citing-ukraine]\n. It is even more mind-boggling to consider the levels of centralization in the\nvast world of online purchases: more than 75% is dominated by Amazon and eBay\nalone\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/270884/most-visited-websites-in-the-retail-sector-in-the-us/]\n!\n\nWith the grip they’ve got on the web, the world’s biggest tech companies are\nquickly accumulating information and power akin to the world’s most powerful\nstates, but are conversely in a position to be entirely subdued by the\nregulations of those state entities — they have as a consequence become\ninstrumental, essential aspects of the state surveillance apparatus of places\nlike China, but also of the USA and partners of the Five Eyes intelligence\nalliance [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes].\n\nBut that’s not all, they also often go well beyond the bounds of what they are\nlegally required to censor on their platforms, and that’s never been as accurate\nas in recent times. Aside from anti-competition practices like the censoring of\nspecific businesses or industries that may hurt their bottom line, as we’ve seen\nwith eBay/Paypal banning crypto mining hardware years ago\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1iyzkg/if_you_get_caught_selling_bitcoin_hardware_on/]\n, it is often seen as a responsibility for them to control and shape the\nnarrative for their interpretation of the “greater good” — from banning\nindividual politicians, to books, to countries, and all the way to entire\nsubjects of discourse. \n\nSocial media giants like Facebook and Twitter are especially guilty of that form\nof ideological control, but the corruption runs much deeper. Paypal will\nfamously refuse service to a myriad of categories of fully law-abiding citizens\n— sometimes on the simple basis of running Tor nodes\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/paypal-shuts-down-long-time-tor-supporter-no-recourse] \nor being of Russian or Belarusian nationality\n[https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/paypal-russia-ukraine]. Not even AirBNB\n[https://www.newsweek.com/airbnb-ban-russia-belarus-booking-rooms-abroad-ukraine-war-1695053] \nis above punishing individuals that correspond to broad categories of people on\nthe basis of their own political ideology. Sure, one can debate the reasons for\nsuch actions given certain geopolitical events, but as with any slippery slope\ngoes, where does it end? The truth of the matter is that these corporations have\nset very dangerous and flexible precedents that we should all unilaterally\nreject.\n\nAnd to that end, we must understand that it is our own habits that contribute to\nthis self-defeating and cannibalistic dynamic. When available on such a macro\nscale, data itself directly translates to money and influence\n[https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-companies-turn-your-data-into-money] for the\ncorporations that collect it — that’s why it’s become a core aspect of the\nbusiness models of giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. And we, in the end,\nare the ones that enable this to happen. We are the ones that \"feed the beast\"\nwith all the data they need to adapt and push their agendas accordingly and\nmaintain their dominance. \n\nIt's time to take matters into our own hands!\nThis state of affairs is a central motivator behind why we are so hell-bent on\nworking on Particl [https://particl.io]: we want to starve these corporations of\ntheir data fuel and stop them from abusing their powers by going back to a free\ninternet as it was initially intended — one that gives you complete freedom,\nprivacy, and liberty of action without any sort of prejudice.\n\nA flagship of our vision is establishing and enabling a 100% decentralized,\nperson\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/intro/intro_marketplace_brief_overview.html]\n-to\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/intro/intro_marketplace_brief_overview.html]\n-person marketplace\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/intro/intro_marketplace_brief_overview.html]\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/intro/intro_marketplace_brief_overview.html] \nthat has zero middlemen, that is 100% private, and that doesn’t generate ANY\nidentifiable data about you in the first place. No data, no problem; that’s the\ncrux of the idea behind Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace]!\n\nIt is an online and entirely distributed marketplace that is owned by nobody and\neverybody at the same time; you are the captain of this ship. There is no\ncentral authority and no one with special powers. Moderation and governance are\nentirely community-based, reflecting the will of a decentralized, autonomous,\nand truly global community. The PART privacy coin enables much of this —\npayments are peer-to-peer, completely anonymous, borderless, and they cannot be\nfrozen, seized, withdrawn, or tainted.\n\nAll of this makes it the world’s only REAL free-market economy. You can buy or\nsell anything with no restrictions and without providing valuable data to any\ncentral and self-proclaimed authority. Free at last!\n\nBecome uncompromisingly and unapologetically free\nBut we, at Particl, can only do so much; we all need to do our part to switch\nthe balance of power back to us, the people. Luckily, that’s more or less\neffortless on your end.\n\nIn fact, by simply buying or selling stuff on Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] instead of your typical online marketplaces\nlike eBay or Amazon, you contribute to the fight against the dangerous\ncentralization of the web by not feeding corporation sharks the precious data\nthey need to impose their will and unfair practices. And don’t you worry, it’s\nnot all vague and abstract; you benefit directly and instantly from this! By\ntransacting directly with others on a P2P network, you skip any middleman that\nwould otherwise charge you fees or collect your personal information for god\nknows why. And so, you empower, at the same time, yourself and our society as a\nwhole, not corporations that see you as a mere commodity.\n\nIf that idea resonates with you, then what are you waiting for? We are already\nlive! We invite you to join and connect with like-minded individuals who’ve\nalready done what’s best for them; cutting off the middleman and joining a true\nfree-market economy with Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace].\nIt is high time to stand up for our rights and claim our freedom and\nsovereignty, don’t you agree?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance? Curious to see what others already said? Even better, start\ntalking about this story with peers and pals by tagging them in your tweets.\n\nLive on Twitter [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PARTICL]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs Particl Marketplace for you?\nBuy and sell anything free of commissions, restrictions, and prying eyes.\n\nFor Vendors [http://particl.io/seller] andFor Customers\n[http://particl.io/buyer]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/04/Internet-centralized-blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Internet-centralized-blog.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Internet-centralized-blog.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/04/Internet-centralized-blog.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/04/Internet-centralized-blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>Today’s internet is very, very different from what it used to be.

The law was passed\nin the European parliament and targets European Union members and the companies\nthat wish to do business there – however, its presence has been noticeable in\nthe past few years all across the internet, especially in the form of a pop-up\non many websites asking you to confirm or alter the website’s use of cookies.\n\nThe Myth of GDPR and Consent-Based Privacy Regulations\nUnfortunately, the GDPR, and most other privacy or data-related government\nregulations, are little more than political grandstanding for\ndemocratically-elected governments to signal that they are \"doing something\"\nabout the increasingly prevalent issue of online privacy and data harvesting. As\na result, not much is changing in practice from a data collection and usage\nperspective. The same is true for most companies that have started to do\nmarketing out of their \"strong privacy policies\". It has become a marketing\nbuzzword, and when you dig deeper, you realize they are still collecting, using,\nsharing, and often losing your data.\n\nIn concrete terms, the GDPR and most other data regulations only require\ncompanies to disclose what data they collect and what they do with it. Then,\nthey have to get you to accept those terms and conditions. Oftentimes, if you\ndon't accept, you simply won’t be able to use the product or platform, or\nsometimes only in a limited manner. It is also an obvious fact that most people\nsimply accept TOCs without really reading them, since these \"requests for data\nuse\" pop up almost everywhere you go online now and just take too much time to\nproperly read through.\n\nOther times, for instance when you want to register to a marketplace like Amazon\nor Ebay, simply registering to the platform means that you agree to their TOCs\non data collection and usage. Don’t agree with them overlooking your every move?\nThen you are refused services and can’t do business on their platform. And you\nwould be well-advised not to accept these terms in many cases. After all,\ne-commerce data, such as data generated by online shoppers and vendors, is\nconstantly used to study certain business sectors in order to overtake them more\neffectively, especially in the case of Amazon\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015]\n. This results in honest sellers going out of business thanks to the very own\ndata they provided to e-commerce platforms. Deep down, do you really agree to\nthis when using a marketplace - or are you merely being coerced into accepting\nwhat's being imposed on you?\n\nThere seemingly is no real alternative to protect your data when browsing the\nweb anymore. All platforms collect your information, a lot of them lose it to\nhackers or due to gross negligence, and multiple parties still track your every\nmove, GDPR or not.\n\nThe Golden Promise of Decentralized E-Commerce\n\nDecentralized apps, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, and decentralized\nmarketplaces are in a prime position to tackle the issue from the core. The\nability to buy and sell anything with no middleman, directly person-to-person,\nand with no restrictions sends us back to the original principles of cash\ntransactions while transcending physical borders and promising equal access to\nall. Although in a nascent stage, it can be said for many to be the future of\ne-commerce.\n\nMany decentralized marketplaces, however, have a critical weakness that could\npotentially make them worse than even traditional marketplaces like Amazon. In\nthe case of traditional blockchain technology, all the data is tracked on a\npublic blockchain or over publicly-accessible networks. That oversight, combined\nwith increasingly sophisticated blockchain tracing and blockchain data mining,\nmeans all of that data is publicly viewable to anyone. So now, it's not just the\nmarketplace and its partners that have access to your data, it’s whoever is\ncurious enough to simply look it up. That’s bad if you're an individual, and\ncritically damaging if you are a business that ends up revealing their critical\ndata to competitors.\n\nIn some other cases, decentralized marketplaces are not entirely decentralized\nand various data sets go directly through third-parties or central authorities;\nessentially bringing us back to the very same core issues observed with typical\ne-commerce platforms built on traditional web technology.\n\nYes, the Solution is De-Commerce, BUT With Full Privacy\nThis is precisely the raison d’etre of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace]. We are delivering all the promises of\ndecentralized commerce (decommerce), but we're also fixing the critical issue of\ndata leaks and exposure by making it inherently private.\n\nEvery single aspect of the marketplace is private; from your transactions, to\nyour sales data, and all the way up to your browsing habits or even your network\nconnection. We don't track what you look for, how many seconds you look at one\nthing, or where your cursor wanders. The end result? Your personal and business\ninformation, shipping details, and network identity remain entirely private and\nsecure. You have total and uncompromising freedom to conduct business the way\nyou want to and with who you want to.\n\nOne thing is for certain: the best way to protect your data from leaks and abuse\nis to not have any data to collect in the first place. And that is precisely how\nParticl protects you. Whether you're buying or selling stuff on Particl, the\nmarketplace simply never ever generates any traceable or identifiable data about\nyou. No data, no problem. It’s that simple!\n\nSay NO to \"Being the Product\"!\nThere is simply no need to stress over unnecessarily long and convoluted privacy\npolicies or over whether or not a particular website you visit is competent\nenough not to lose or misuse your data.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
