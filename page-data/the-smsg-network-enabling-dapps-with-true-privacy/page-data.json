Its network enables decentralized applications (dapps) and smart\ncontracts in a manner similar to Ethereum, Avalanche, and Solana. Particl,\nhowever, presents major differences from those other protocols.\n\nMost “dapp networks” make exclusive use of ‘smart contracts’ — automated\nprograms that run on blockchains and execute actions based on certain\nconditions. And while smart contracts deployed on blockchains are certainly\nrevolutionary, they can carry certain security risks and technical limitations —\nnotably in terms of scaling and data storage.\n\nTypically, in order to support smart contracts, a blockchain has to be built (or\nforked) from the ground up, with smart contract functionalities already in mind\nfrom the beginning. That’s because smart contract compatible blockchains usually\nrequire a VM integration for the smart contract code to execute.\n\nWhile smart contracts are often touted as the end-all-be-all of what makes dapps\npossible, there are a few other ways to build and deploy decentralized\napplications. Such is the case with Particl and its use of the SecureMessaging\n(SMSG) protocol.\n\nThe Issue with “Privacy-Focused dapps” Within the Web3 Community\nWhile a number of other dapp networks claim to offer “smart contracts with\nprivacy”, they usually focus on one or another aspect of what makes a dapp\nprivate. Unfortunately, they fail to check all the boxes that would truly set\nthem aside traditional web applications. They either:\n\n * Use traceable payments or traceable forms of currency;\n * Leak contract contents publicly to anybody, at any time;\n * Leak the IP addresses of their users, compromising the identity and privacy\n   of users;\n * Rely on third-party servers/nodes/hosts controlled by large corporations with\n   questionable ethics or intentions;\n * Are not entirely non-custodial, making it possible for coins to be lost,\n   stolen, or even seized by central authorities\n\nFor a dapp to be considered truly private, or truly decentralized, it should\nideally check all of these boxes. Else, they are just glorified “web2”\napplications trying to exploit users by capitalizing on the web3 hype, but\nwithout providing its promised benefits. And we know that is often the case, as\nwe’ve explored before [https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/],\nmaking it potentially very damaging to a user that expects to be acting in total\nprivacy or in full control of their assets when they are, in fact, not\n[https://bitcoinist.com/iranian-venezuelan-opensea-users/].\n\nTruly Decentralized Apps Done Different\nParticl does dapps too, as is quite obvious with the one-of-a-kind Particl\nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace], but it does so in a way that's\ncompletely different than the rest of the dapp networks. \n\nIts blockchain is built using the latest Bitcoin code, which, unlike its\nEthereum counterpart, does not support “turing-complete smart contracts”. It\ndoes, however, absolutely support smart contracts — just a more rigid and tight\nversion of them. Although already powerful enough to create wonderful\napplications without intermediary, Bitcoin smart contracts are also expected to\nexpand in utility with the integration of Taproot and the upcoming Taproot-based\nTARO protocol. Subsequently, PART will adopt these features.\n\nThe purpose of Particl’s blockchain within its ecosystem is many:\n\n * Allow users to send, receive, and hold an untraceable currency in a wallet or\n   through its dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace or the BasicSwap DEX);\n * Create and interact with smart contracts;\n * Allow for a community governance of its dapps and of the network as a whole\n\nNotably, the privacy-focused Particl blockchain does not take the role of\nhosting and running the ecosystem’s dapps, and does not manage any data\non-chain. That’s because that role is, most often than not, not managed by smart\ncontracts, but instead by a completely separate layer: the SecureMessaging\n(SMSG) P2P network.\n\nSecureMessaging (SMSG) — A Game Changer for Dapps\nThe SecureMessaging (SMSG) network is Particl’s secret sauce and what sets it\naside from any other “dapp networks”. It is its own custom-built and unique P2P\nmessaging network that stands at the very core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the \nBitMessage protocol [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network\nis a decentralized\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Decentralization] \nstorage network (DSN) that stores and transfers data across nodes in a\nprivacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).\n\nWhat SMSG does is enable a private and secure data transfer layer for dApps to\nleverage. Contrary to smart-contracts, which often run through centralized\nthird-party nodes, every user of Particl dapp is a SMSG node, ensuring an\noptimal level of decentralization but also making active and passive network\nanalysis much more complicated. \n\nAs a result, you create complex applications without middlemen and data mining\nwithout relying on over-complicated smart-contracts that may leave glaring holes\nopen for attackers to exploit. \n\nSMSG powers Particl dapps, like the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] and the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, but without\nbloating the blockchain with excessive data and without leaving any permanent\nrecord.\n\nSMSG's Network TopologySMSG occupies several important functions within the\ncurrent Particl ecosystem:\n\nData storage and transfer: The network can store almost any type of data and\ntransfer it from one user to another, or to the entirety of the network, in a\ncompletely end-to-end encrypted and decentralized manner. The identities of the\nsender and receiver(s) of that data remain anonymous at any point in time to\nunauthorized parties and there’s no server involved at any point of the process.\n\nSecure communications: Text, too, is data. The SMSG network allows for two or\nmore parties to communicate with one another through an instant messaging\nprotocol, without relying on any centralized servers. All messages are\nend-to-end encrypted and can never be decrypted by an unauthorized party.\n\nExecute smart escrow instructions: A critical part of the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] dapp is its unique two-party escrow system\nwhich relies on a simplified Bitcoin-style smart contract. Instead of coding\nseveral functions and conditions into the smart contract itself, which carries\nits load of risks and potential vulnerabilities, the Particl smart contract\ninstead listens to instructions received from the SMSG network based on the\naction of participating users. This simplifies the smart-contract process, which\nin turn limits vulnerabilities, and offsets the complex interaction with the\nescrow to the SMSG network. When it comes to smart contracts, simplicity is\nsecurity.\n\nHost marketplace listing content: Because hosting listing data (i.e., product\ndescriptions and images) directly on-chain can quickly bloat a blockchain and\nmake it incredibly large, the Particl Marketplace dapp relies on SMSG’s private\ndata storage functionality to store and provide that information.\n\nEnable complex DEX with orderbooks: With the help of SMSG and ‘scriptless\nscripts’, a type of off-chain smart contract, cross-chain DEXs can now exist\nwith complete order book functionalities that don't require central parties to\nstore and process its data. While the atomic swap technology lets two users swap\ncryptocurrencies with no intermediary, a secondary messaging layer is necessary\nto carry data between the two chains without the use of wrapped assets or third\nparties — which is precisely where most of the challenges related to cross-chain\nDEXs lie.  SMSG takes the role of safely and privately aggregating the\ninformation (order details, order prices, user actions, etc.) and communicating\nbetween users of two different blockchains, like Particl, Bitcoin, and even\nMonero.\n\nAs we can see, a lot can be accomplished with Particl’s basic smart contracts\nusing the SMSG network. It is what puts the Particl ecosystem in a league of its\nown and the reason why Particl’s dapps possess a level of privacy and\ndecentralization that is unmatched — there isn't any compromise and they truly\ncheck all the boxes mentioned in the section above!\n\nImproving SMSG Beyond its Current Capabilities\nAs we’ve seen, SMSG is a great P2P network that enables private data storage and\nprocessing, secure and encrypted communications, and even anonymous dapps. But\nit’s also faced with a significant challenge — that of scalability.\n\nIndeed, for all its glory, the SMSG network is limited in terms of scalability\nand could bottleneck when Particl reaches a large enough level of adoption.\nWhile it can support a lot of data and many thousand of messages per day, it\ncould hit its throughput limit should too many people use it at the same time,\nor if it’s made to support a particularly heavy data load.\n\nSMSG 2.0 — More Scalability and More Functionality\nThis is the reason why the Particl team plans, as part of its roadmap\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021#major-milestones], a major overhaul of\nits code, which includes the exciting release of SMSG 2.0. This SMSG update will\nmake Particl’s unique open source P2P network scalable enough to support any\nlevel of adoption — a must when building dApps that seek to challenge the status\nquo!\n\nAdditionally, it will not only support data storage and transfer anymore, but\nalso support the hosting and browsing of content on it, similarly to how the Tor\nnetwork functions. Imagine browsing web pages and using dapps straight from the\nSMSG network and without connecting to the \"clearnet\". That's where we're headed\nat!\n\nWe’ll be covering all the juicy details about SMSG 2.0 and much more information\nabout how it will power the Particl ecosystem moving forward in an upcoming\nParticl News blog post shortly, so, as always, keep your eyes peeled for future\nupdates coming to Particl News!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is a decentralized ecosystem of privacy-focused applications.

It is its own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network that stands at the very core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\">BitMessage protocol</a>, the SMSG network is a<a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Decentralization\"> decentralized</a> storage network (DSN) that stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>What SMSG does is enable a private and secure data transfer layer for dApps to leverage. Contrary to smart-contracts, which often run through centralized third-party nodes, every user of Particl dapp is a SMSG node, ensuring an optimal level of decentralization but also making active and passive network analysis much more complicated. </p><p>As a result, you create complex applications without middlemen and data mining without relying on over-complicated smart-contracts that may leave glaring holes open for attackers to exploit. </p><p>SMSG powers Particl dapps, like the <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> and the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, but without bloating the blockchain with excessive data and without leaving any permanent record.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2022/06/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>SMSG's Network Topology</em></figcaption></figure><p>SMSG occupies several important functions within the current Particl ecosystem:</p><p><strong>Data storage and transfer: </strong>The network can store almost any type of data and transfer it from one user to another, or to the entirety of the network, in a completely end-to-end encrypted and decentralized manner. The identities of the sender and receiver(s) of that data remain anonymous at any point in time to unauthorized parties and there’s no server involved at any point of the process.</p><p><strong>Secure communications:</strong> Text, too, is data. The SMSG network allows for two or more parties to communicate with one another through an instant messaging protocol, without relying on any centralized servers. All messages are end-to-end encrypted and can never be decrypted by an unauthorized party.</p><p><strong>Execute smart escrow instructions: </strong>A critical part of the <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> dapp is its unique two-party escrow system which relies on a simplified Bitcoin-style smart contract. Instead of coding several functions and conditions into the smart contract itself, which carries its load of risks and potential vulnerabilities, the Particl smart contract instead listens to instructions received from the SMSG network based on the action of participating users. This simplifies the smart-contract process, which in turn limits vulnerabilities, and offsets the complex interaction with the escrow to the SMSG network. When it comes to smart contracts, simplicity is security.</p><p><strong>Host marketplace listing content:</strong> Because hosting listing data (i.e., product descriptions and images) directly on-chain can quickly bloat a blockchain and make it incredibly large, the Particl Marketplace dapp relies on SMSG’s private data storage functionality to store and provide that information.</p><p><strong>Enable complex DEX with orderbooks:</strong> With the help of SMSG and ‘scriptless scripts’, a type of off-chain smart contract, cross-chain DEXs can now exist with complete order book functionalities that don't require central parties to store and process its data. While the atomic swap technology lets two users swap cryptocurrencies with no intermediary, a secondary messaging layer is necessary to carry data between the two chains without the use of wrapped assets or third parties — which is precisely where most of the challenges related to cross-chain DEXs lie.  SMSG takes the role of safely and privately aggregating the information (order details, order prices, user actions, etc.) and communicating between users of two different blockchains, like Particl, Bitcoin, and even Monero.</p><p>As we can see, a lot can be accomplished with Particl’s basic smart contracts using the SMSG network. It is what puts the Particl ecosystem in a league of its own and the reason why Particl’s dapps possess a level of privacy and decentralization that is unmatched — there isn't any compromise and they truly check all the boxes mentioned in the section above!</p><h2 id=\"improving-smsg-beyond-its-current-capabilities\">Improving SMSG Beyond its Current Capabilities</h2><p>As we’ve seen, SMSG is a great P2P network that enables private data storage and processing, secure and encrypted communications, and even anonymous dapps. But it’s also faced with a significant challenge — that of scalability.</p><p>Indeed, for all its glory, the SMSG network is limited in terms of scalability and could bottleneck when Particl reaches a large enough level of adoption. While it can support a lot of data and many thousand of messages per day, it could hit its throughput limit should too many people use it at the same time, or if it’s made to support a particularly heavy data load.</p><h3 id=\"smsg-2-0-more-scalability-and-more-functionality\">SMSG 2.0 — More Scalability and More Functionality</h3><p>This is the reason why the Particl team plans, <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021#major-milestones\">as part of its roadmap</a>, a major overhaul of its code, which includes the exciting release of SMSG 2.0. This SMSG update will make Particl’s unique open source P2P network scalable enough to support any level of adoption — a must when building dApps that seek to challenge the status quo!</p><p>Additionally, it will not only support data storage and transfer anymore, but also support the hosting and browsing of content on it, similarly to how the Tor network functions. Imagine browsing web pages and using dapps straight from the SMSG network and without connecting to the \"clearnet\". That's where we're headed at!</p><p>We’ll be covering all the juicy details about SMSG 2.0 and much more information about how it will power the Particl ecosystem moving forward in an upcoming Particl News blog post shortly, so, as always, keep your eyes peeled for future updates coming to Particl News!</p><hr><p><em>Particl is a decentralized ecosystem of privacy-focused applications.

Desktop 3.2.1. This\nupdate does not introduce any new feature but rather pushes a lot of bug fixes,\nimprovements, as well as major dependencies updates.\n\nBecause the scope of the changes is relatively large, especially regarding the\ndependencies update, we highly encourage the community to test the new builds on\ntheir devices to ensure they run smoothly across all operating systems and\nenvironments. \n\nPlease refer to the end of this article for a full list of changes introduced by\nthis update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2.1-RC-001: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1-RC-001\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.2.1 Public Testnet · particl/particl-desktopParticl\nDesktop v3.2.1 Public TestnetRELEASE INFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN\nVERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.2.1testnet0.21.2.90.3.101.7.0\nUPDATES AND FIXES...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1-RC-001]To get\ntestnet coins, visit the Particl faucet [https://faucet.particl.xyz/].\n\nIf you happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\nIf you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\nnumber of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your Particl\nDesktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a seeding\nnode: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode \"165.22.203.185:51938\"\n\"add\".\n\nIf you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly on\nthe Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] page.\n\nYour wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\nmarketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered to\nbe a Beta release.\n\nThe Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\napplication can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Updates electron to v19 to fix GUI/Application related startup issues,\n   specifically with recent Linux updates/distro releases.\n * Updates the application to use nodejs v16 as a minimum version.\n\nMarketplace App\n * Fixes some occurrences of the marketplace service startup failing not be\n   detected and resulting in the user interface showing the loading/startup\n   panel indefinitely.\n * The Buy page > Orders tab now has the activity indicator \"flashing\" (to\n   indicate pending user activity) for the correct buyer-specific steps (fixes\n   an error introduced in v3.2.0).\n * Fixes the failure of a market promotion estimation not displaying the\n   relevant error message when the estimation fails, and instead would fall back\n   incorrectly to displaying a price of 1 PART per day.\n * When promoting a market, the utxo count is now checked before any messages\n   are sent instead of after the market content message is sent. This should\n   prevent a common error where a market with an image is promoted but, due to\n   insufficient utxos available, the market itself is promoted, but the image is\n   sent and the GUI shows that an error occurred (despite the actual market\n   being  promoted but without an associated image).\n * The smsg keys for a market are now only removed from particl-core after the\n   market is successfully removed from particl-marketplace database (should\n   prevent an error with the removal of the market from the database from\n   stopping the market from receiving new listing items).\n * The Cart page > Shipping form now defaults the 'Save shipping profile'\n   checkbox to true if there are no addresses previously saved.\n * Adds the 'Add to cart' functionality for the listing item details modal that\n   is launched from the Chat Messages > Conversations tab (for Listing Item type\n   chats).\n * Removes the marketplace service's monitor functionality for now.\n\nWallet Module\n * Transaction table entries now display the confirmation count after the\n   transaction description rather than before it: this both keeps the layout\n   consistent and prevents the transaction amount from being cutoff\n   (half-hidden) when the application window is at its smallest dimensions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs stated, because of the scope of the changes introduced by this release,\nnotably related to major dependencies updates, we highly encourage the community\nto test it out extensively to ensure it runs smoothly on all platforms and\nenvironments. Once everything is confirmed to run as expected, we will push this\nrelease to mainnet.\n\nAs always, thank you for your dedication and passion for the Particl mission!\nYour support helps keep this project going strong every day!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

3.2\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-live-on-mainnet/] and its messaging\nsystem behind us, it’s time to look into what exactly Particl Desktop 3.3 will\nbring forth to the table.\n\nFirst off, we’d like to mention that, following the release of Particl Desktop\n3.3, Particl will begin with its next major evolutionary phase by introducing a\nnew layer of distributed services. The concept we've built with Particl\nMarketplace undoubtedly works, and now it's time to unfold beyond our current\nscope and expand towards the wider Web3 environment. As we've highlighted\nrecently [https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], Web3 is the\npromise of an open, decentralized, non-custodial, immutable, and private web\nenvironment that is as easy to use as any other web service, but it's currently\nplagued by many issues which we fully intend on tackling with Particl's next\nevolutionary phase. More information about what Particl's next evolutionary\nphase entails will be communicated very shortly here on Particl News.\n\nWeb3 Exposed! Is it Only a Mirage?A cold hard and in-depth look into the\npromises and current realities of “Web3”.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]But for now, let's take\na look at what Particl Desktop 3.3 will bring to the table. This release focuses\non improving various back-end processes and improving the client’s user\nconfigurability to get Particl Desktop ready for the upcoming new major\ndevelopment cycle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 Items\nBefore getting into the list of deliverables for Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like\nto mention that this list is tentative, meaning that not necessarily all of the\nitems listed here will end up in the next update. In a way, this is more akin to\na wishlist than a definitive checklist, but this should give you a good idea of\nwhat we’re aiming for with this next update.\n\nNevertheless, let’s take a look at the items we’re currently looking into for\nParticl Desktop 3.3.\n\nUpdate Particl desktop Dependencies\nMostly a back-end maintenance task, updating the client’s dependencies keeps it\nup-to-date and ensures security issues don't creep in. Additionally, it makes\nsure no compatibility issues appear, such as we’ve seen recently with the\nFedora/Manjaro OS environments.\n\nParticl Desktop Startup Changes\nThis significant modification changes how the startup process runs by putting\nmore control into the user’s hands. Some of the changes for this include\nremoving the automatic download and/or start of particld on the start of Particl\nDesktop and adding various options like  download/start/stop/restart/auto-start\nto the user interface. Also included in this change is the ability to block the\nstart of different desktop apps unless Particl Core is currently running. This\nshould eliminate a few edge case issues and give users more control over their\nexperience, notably with the ability to improve their client performance based\non their specific utilization of it.\n\nAdd a Basic Settings and Configuration Implementation\nSimilar to the item mentioned above, a basic settings and configuration\nimplementation will enable users to tweak various settings right from the GUI.\nThis is a one-up over the currently available settings in Particl Desktop, this\nimplementation will let users tweak more settings and do so more granularly.\nThis implementation will touch on things such as indicating how to start/stop\nparticl-core (auto-start or manual start, for example), as well as various\nsettings related to download location, etc.\n\nUpdate Particl Desktop to Use Particl Core v22\nThis item is self-explanatory. Particl Desktop 3.3 will work over the more\nrecent Particl Core V22. You can consult the list of changes introduced by\nParticl Core V22 here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md]\n.\n\nParticl Market — Allow for the Deletion of Previously Published Templates\nThis widely requested feature from some of our current sellers on the\nmarketplace relates to the deletion of listing templates once they have been\npublished on a market or storefront at least once. This is a relatively\nsignificant change but will go a long way in improving sellers' user experience.\n\nParticl Market — Remove the Requirement for Markets to Belong to a Single\nIdentity\nExpanding on the concept of multiple identities, we're removing the restriction\nthat a market can only be joined by a single identity at a time. This will add\nthe ability for markets or storefronts to be accessed by different identities.\nOne notable benefit of this feature is the added privacy aspect of decoupling\nmarket ownership, vendor account ownership, and chat message identities.\n\nParticl Market — Remove the Reviews & Comments Section\nThis section, which doesn't seem to be used much, is now made redundant thanks\nto the introduction of the better chat functionality of Particl Desktop 3.2 now.\nFor this reason, we will remove its implementation from the system.\n\nParticl Desktop — Allow for Alternative PD Utilized URLs to be Supported\nThis should allow for supporting Tor-related links to various services.\n\nParticl Desktop currently makes use of various internet-related services, as\nwell as providing various web links that the user may click on for various\nreasons. For example, when checking for, and the downloading of, a new\nparticl-core version, Particl Desktop makes a connection to Github. Another\nexample is the links in the Help & Support section of Particl Desktop that\nprovide links to the social media sites of the Particl project (that open on the\nuser's browser when clicked on).\n\nThese links are all currently fixed and hard-coded. This can present a problem\n(particularly for the initial particl-core download on the first run of the\napplication), for those wishing to use Particl Desktop over Tor (or similarly\nrestricted environments) where access to public services/URLs such as Github\nmight be restricted or unwanted.\n\nThe solution aimed here is to remove these hard-coded URLs, allow them to be\nconfigurable as well (via the aforementioned PD Settings feature), and offer\nTor-related alternatives, if available, for those wanting them.\n\nParticl Market — Add the Ability to Purchase Digital Items\nThe ability to purchase digital items, or rather, items that do not require\nphysical addresses for shipping, is something we started looking into a while\nago. However, due to the significant changes it required, we put that\ndeliverable on ice for a little while. For Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like to\njump back into it and work towards making that a possibility.\n\nMinor UI Tweaks and Improvements, and Bug Fixes\nThere is a list of minor UI and UX tweaks we want to include in the desktop\nclient.

This release focuses on improving various back-end processes and improving the client’s user configurability to get Particl Desktop ready for the upcoming new major development cycle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-3-3-items\">Particl Desktop 3.3 Items</h2><p>Before getting into the list of deliverables for Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like to mention that this list is tentative, meaning that not necessarily all of the items listed here will end up in the next update. In a way, this is more akin to a wishlist than a definitive checklist, but this should give you a good idea of what we’re aiming for with this next update.</p><p>Nevertheless, let’s take a look at the items we’re currently looking into for Particl Desktop 3.3.</p><h3 id=\"update-particl-desktop-dependencies\"><strong>Update Particl desktop Dependencies</strong></h3><p>Mostly a back-end maintenance task, updating the client’s dependencies keeps it up-to-date and ensures security issues don't creep in. Additionally, it makes sure no compatibility issues appear, such as we’ve seen recently with the Fedora/Manjaro OS environments.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-startup-changes\"><strong>Particl Desktop Startup Changes</strong></h3><p>This significant modification changes how the startup process runs by putting more control into the user’s hands. Some of the changes for this include removing the automatic download and/or start of particld on the start of Particl Desktop and adding various options like  download/start/stop/restart/auto-start to the user interface. Also included in this change is the ability to block the start of different desktop apps unless Particl Core is currently running. This should eliminate a few edge case issues and give users more control over their experience, notably with the ability to improve their client performance based on their specific utilization of it.</p><h3 id=\"add-a-basic-settings-and-configuration-implementation\"><strong>Add a Basic Settings and Configuration Implementation</strong></h3><p>Similar to the item mentioned above, a basic settings and configuration implementation will enable users to tweak various settings right from the GUI. This is a one-up over the currently available settings in Particl Desktop, this implementation will let users tweak more settings and do so more granularly. This implementation will touch on things such as indicating how to start/stop particl-core (auto-start or manual start, for example), as well as various settings related to download location, etc.</p><h3 id=\"update-particl-desktop-to-use-particl-core-v22\"><strong>Update Particl Desktop to Use Particl Core v22</strong></h3><p>This item is self-explanatory. Particl Desktop 3.3 will work over the more recent Particl Core V22. You can consult the list of changes introduced by Particl Core V22 <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md\">here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-allow-for-the-deletion-of-previously-published-templates\"><strong>Particl Market — Allow for the Deletion of Previously Published Templates</strong></h3><p>This widely requested feature from some of our current sellers on the marketplace relates to the deletion of listing templates once they have been published on a market or storefront at least once. This is a relatively significant change but will go a long way in improving sellers' user experience.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-remove-the-requirement-for-markets-to-belong-to-a-single-identity\"><strong>Particl Market — Remove the Requirement for Markets to Belong to a Single Identity</strong></h3><p>Expanding on the concept of multiple identities, we're removing the restriction that a market can only be joined by a single identity at a time. This will add the ability for markets or storefronts to be accessed by different identities. One notable benefit of this feature is the added privacy aspect of decoupling market ownership, vendor account ownership, and chat message identities.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-remove-the-reviews-comments-section\"><strong>Particl Market — Remove the Reviews &amp; Comments Section</strong></h3><p>This section, which doesn't seem to be used much, is now made redundant thanks to the introduction of the better chat functionality of Particl Desktop 3.2 now. For this reason, we will remove its implementation from the system.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-allow-for-alternative-pd-utilized-urls-to-be-supported\"><strong>Particl Desktop — Allow for Alternative PD Utilized URLs to be Supported</strong></h3><p>This should allow for supporting Tor-related links to various services.</p><p>Particl Desktop currently makes use of various internet-related services, as well as providing various web links that the user may click on for various reasons. For example, when checking for, and the downloading of, a new particl-core version, Particl Desktop makes a connection to Github. Another example is the links in the Help &amp; Support section of Particl Desktop that provide links to the social media sites of the Particl project (that open on the user's browser when clicked on).</p><p>These links are all currently fixed and hard-coded. This can present a problem (particularly for the initial particl-core download on the first run of the application), for those wishing to use Particl Desktop over Tor (or similarly restricted environments) where access to public services/URLs such as Github might be restricted or unwanted.</p><p>The solution aimed here is to remove these hard-coded URLs, allow them to be configurable as well (via the aforementioned PD Settings feature), and offer Tor-related alternatives, if available, for those wanting them.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-add-the-ability-to-purchase-digital-items\"><strong>Particl Market — Add the Ability to Purchase Digital Items</strong></h3><p>The ability to purchase digital items, or rather, items that do not require physical addresses for shipping, is something we started looking into a while ago. However, due to the significant changes it required, we put that deliverable on ice for a little while. For Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like to jump back into it and work towards making that a possibility.</p><h3 id=\"minor-ui-tweaks-and-improvements-and-bug-fixes\"><strong>Minor UI Tweaks and Improvements, and Bug Fixes</strong></h3><p>There is a list of minor UI and UX tweaks we want to include in the desktop client. This includes, but isn’t limited to, ordering of the listed markets, showing a list of messages sent by a saved chat participant, and more. Additionally, as always, there’s also a list of minor issues and bugs we want to fix for Particl Desktop 3.3.</p><h2 id=\"stay-tuned-for-more-details-on-particl-s-next-evolutionary-process\">Stay Tuned for More Details on Particl’s Next Evolutionary Process</h2><p>As mentioned above, we are planning on beginning with Particl's next evolutionary process right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. This process will not only introduce a new layer of distributed services to the ecosystem and bring Particl up to par with the expected level of accessibility from Web3 apps, but it will also improve said Web3 in many ways by tackling some of its most urgent issues, as we've highlighted in this <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">Particl Story</a>. </p><p>In fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to make the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers, vendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable with established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work, and more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3 ecosystem and community.</p><p>In other words, it is a major stride at increasing Particl’s aim for becoming the go-to solution and hub for non-interference and privacy-first applications within the new but fast-growing Web3 community. Because, we believe people shall not be the product and that corporate monopolies don’t help create a better world.</p><p>There will be much more to talk about in detail and you’ll read it here first, on Particl News in the coming weeks.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>.
