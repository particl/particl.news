It contains valuable information still\nvalid to this day regarding adjusting the listing fees of Particl Marketplace.\nPlease consult the table of contents to jump to the relevant section or click\nhere.\nOn the 12th of August 2019, the Particl Open Marketplace launched live on\nmainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-is-now-live-on-mainnet-bed75988b690]\n. This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving\nany data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the\neCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open\nMarketplace is still a Beta piece of software.\n\nThat means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for\nmass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means\nthis current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect\ntesting ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be\nimproved.\n\nIndeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the\ncommunity of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different\nperspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more\nquickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click me)\n * Dynamic Listing Fees\n * Why are Listing Fees Needed\n * High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\n * Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic Listing Fees\nOne of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of\nParticl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an\nitem or service up for sale. \n\nLuckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its\ncommunity of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true\nfor Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. \n\nFor this reason, it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees\nof the marketplace. It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk\nyou through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main\nimplications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That\nwill serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much\nyou want to change the listing fees of the network.\n\nWhy are Listing Fees Needed?\nThere are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing\nitems. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is\nthe ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very\nappealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.\n\nFighting Spam\nThe first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because\nthere is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any\nperson with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from\nspamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees\nto introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low\nend, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings,\nthen it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.\n\nThat’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the\nsame reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or\nParticl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized\nnetworks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no\nrecourse.\n\nKeeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date \nAnother lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to\nkeep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore.\nThat’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation\npowers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite\nproblematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for\na certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the\nseller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order.\nPretty annoying, right?\n\nHow listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on\ntwo factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc)\nand the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you\nset your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system\nworks in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a\nfinancial cost to its duration. \n\nTheoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then\nit is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of\nthe listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.\n\nIncentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network\nAnother important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the\nsecurity of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. \n\nIn fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to\nstakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards\nwill keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a\ngreater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the\nnetwork effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to\nspread the word around in an organic manner.\n\nHigh Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\nBefore you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is\nimportant to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some\narguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both\nperspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.\n\nLower fees\n * Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller\n * Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nHigher fees\n * More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the\n   marketplace and higher barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater\n * Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nIt’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller\nstaking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards \nper listing published, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on\nthe marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more\nindividual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.\n\nTutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\nSo you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but\ndon’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact,\nsince Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast\ntheir target listing fee to the network.\n\nA Community-Powered Tug-of-War\nOne staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he\nwants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community\nconsensus.\n\nListing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week\n(10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by\nstakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a\nconstant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the\nsmsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is\nstaked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee\ntargets broadcast by stakers. \n\nThe smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then,\nonce the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current\nsmsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th\nblock.\n\nThis can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war. Each staker broadcasts\nto the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace\n(higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards\nor downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers\nwant fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If\nthe majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget\nwill slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want\ndramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a\nmuch faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to\ntheir side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a\ndigital game of tug-of-war.\n\n> Note (01-12-2021): The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and\nimproved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee\ntarget at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.\nThe fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small\nincrements enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the\nprocess of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and\nunpredictable changes).\n\nPut the current value into perspective\nTo get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the\ncurrent market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into\nperspective.\n\nNote: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3\nimages per item and 1000 chars of text.\n\n# Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43\n\nIn the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100\nlistings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale\nwith Particl Marketplace.\n\nNow, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So,\nideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should\nget increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is\nneeded.\n\nBroadcast a Different Listing Fee Target\nThe way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're\ncurrently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two\nthings:\n\n * Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget\n * Broadcast your desired target to the network\n\nIf You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt\nIf you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet\n“unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is\npretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of\nsmsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. \n\nTo do so, simply open up the <console> and enter the smsggetfeerate command.\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nconsole window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns\nthe value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This\nis important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast\ndepending on your preference.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the\nfollowing command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target\nyou want to set.\n\nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nFor example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you\nwould put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then\nsimply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. \nNote that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.\n\n> Important: If you already have a custom stakingoptions parameter, like a custom \nrewardaddress, for example, then please enter the following command into the\n<console> and replace addr by the rewardaddress you set up previously: \nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nIf You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node\nIf you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need\nto broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. \n\nTo do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that\nyou can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and\nenter the following command:\n\n./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nterminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. \n\nAt the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255.\nThis means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to\nknow as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your\npreference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first\nupdate your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:\n\ncd partyman && git pull\n\n Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:\n\n./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget\n\nThis command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that\nyour node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a\nnew target or not. If you wish to do so, type y to move forward through the\nprocess. \n\nOnce that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your\ndesired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if\nyou would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the\nvalue at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the\nvalue at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve\nchosen and written your new target, press Enter to apply the change and start\nbroadcasting it to the network. Note that your desired value has to be 8\ndecimals or less.\n\nIf You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your\ndesired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking\nnode or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your\nliking.\n\nIf You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different\ntarget, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following \nthis link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md]\n.\n\nIf You’re Not Staking\nIf you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the\nnetwork. This is a golden opportunity for you to get started with staking and be\npart of Particl’s fully decentralized consensus-finding process. If you want to\nget started with cold staking, simply follow the steps available in this\nParticl\nAcademy tutorial\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/guides/guide_mp_general_enable_staking.html]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow you’re all set to start broadcasting your listing fee target rate to the\nnetwork. Take note that, at this time, the fee adjusting feature is not optimal\nand may result in negligible changes only. In the next hardfork (early 2022),\nthe feature will be significantly improved and made more effective. But it's\nnever too early to set up your node in the meantime!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace.

If you wish to do so, type <code>y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.

This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving any data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the eCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open Marketplace is still a Beta piece of software.</p><p>That means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for mass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means this current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect testing ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be improved.</p><p>Indeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the community of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different perspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more quickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.</p><hr><h2 id=\"table-of-content-click-me-\">Table of Content (Click me)</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</h2><p>One of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of Particl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an item or service up for sale. </p><p>Luckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its community of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true for Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. </p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees of the marketplace.</strong> It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk you through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main implications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That will serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much you want to change the listing fees of the network.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed?</h2><p>There are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing items. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is the ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very appealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>The first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because there is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any person with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from spamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees to introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low end, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings, then it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.</p><p>That’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the same reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or Particl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized networks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no recourse.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-the-marketplace-content-up-to-date\">Keeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date </h3><p>Another lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to keep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore. That’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation powers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite problematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for a certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the seller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order. Pretty annoying, right?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image-4.png 1313w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>How listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on two factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc) and the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you set your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system works in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a financial cost to its duration. </p><p>Theoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then it is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of the listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.</p><h3 id=\"incentivizing-stakers-to-secure-the-network\">Incentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network</h3><p>Another important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the security of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. </p><p>In fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to stakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards will keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a greater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the network effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to spread the word around in an organic manner.</p><h2 id=\"high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</h2><p>Before you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is important to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some arguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both perspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image-7.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image-7.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image-7.png 1314w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"lower-fees\">Lower fees</h3><ul><li>Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller</li><li>Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><h3 id=\"higher-fees\">Higher fees</h3><ul><li>More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the marketplace and higher barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater</li><li>Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><p>It’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller staking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards <strong>per listing published</strong>, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on the marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more individual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.</p><h2 id=\"tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</h2><p>So you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but don’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact, since Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast their target listing fee to the network.</p><h3 id=\"a-community-powered-tug-of-war\">A Community-Powered Tug-of-War</h3><p>One staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he wants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community consensus.</p><p>Listing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week (10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by stakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a constant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the smsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is staked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee targets broadcast by stakers. </p><p>The smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then, once the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current smsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th block.</p><p><strong>This can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war</strong>. Each staker broadcasts to the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace (higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards or downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to their side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a digital game of tug-of-war.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note (01-12-2021):</em></strong><em> The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and improved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022.

To do it, first update your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> partyman <span class=\"token operator\">&#x26;&#x26;</span> <span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull</code></pre></div><p> Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget</code></pre></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Adjusting-Listing-Fees/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that your node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve chosen and written your new target, press <code class=\"language-text\">Enter</code> to apply the change and start broadcasting it to the network. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your desired target.

time for our weekly\ndevelopment progress report! This week has been one where we've focused on\nfixing a tricky issue with Particl Marketplace and have been exploring how best\nto release Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\nIndeed, an issue was brought to our attention in which some listing messages are\nnot being received by some markets. The problem seems to be related to two\nseparate issues, but both can occur at the same time. Out of these two issues,\none is already fixed but we are still busy investigating the second one\nespecially as it seems to deal with the way the marketplace validates the\nincoming listing messages and, for some reason, appears to be working on some\nmachines correctly but not on others. This makes tracking, and more importantly,\ntesting the problematic code a little trickier than expected. We are looking\ninto this and should have it fixed fairly soon.\n\nAs far as the progression regarding the delivery of digital items goes, there's\nbeen a number of stumbling blocks in getting this working properly. Indeed, it\nnow appears that it will require significantly more time than expected since it\ntouches on many more components of both Particl Desktop and the marketplace\nback-end code.\n\nIn other words, we cannot currently give any estimation yet on when this might\nbe ready and, for this reason, we've begun exploring releasing Particl Desktop\n3.1 without that feature. In fact, we do not want to drag the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 for too long. After releasing Particl V3 on mainnet, we've opted to\ngo ahead with more frequent releases and we intend on sticking to that\ncommitment. \n\nThat being said, even without digital items delivery being included in the next\nParticl Desktop update, we'll see the introduction of a few new features as well\nas a large number of bug/issue fixes and general improvements. Among them, we\ncan count on the addition of a seller-adjustable escrow ratio and various\nimportant seller-focused improvements, notably many new options for importing\ninventories and editing, in bulk, listing prices. The vast majority of these\nadditions have been suggested by Particl Marketplace sellers themselves and\nshould fix some of the most obvious pain points for them.\n\nAs we are giving a final look at what is still required to add the digital items\ndelivery feature, we'll let you know, in next week's progress report, whether\nwe've decided to release V3.1 with or without it. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). This task is in progress but is proving to be much more time-consuming\n   than initially expected. For this reason, we may de-prioritize this task in\n   favour of the other two and release Particl Desktop 3.1 without it. We will\n   be able to confirm if that is the case next week.\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap DEX Progress Report\nThis week on the Core side of things, a lot of testing has gone towards\nactivating Taproot on Particl. We are happy to report that, so far, it seems\nthat everything works fine and as expected.

At this time, it looks likely that we will include it in the next\nhardfork, which should go live early in 2022. We will let you know, well in\nadvance, of all the details related to this hardfork in a blog post on Particl\nNews.\n\n> Note: If you still have any disabled RingCT or CT output, now's the time to\nsubmit your claim to the appropriate portal so that they can be enabled in the\ncoming hardfork. Please have a look at this blog post\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/] to know precisely what is\nrequired from you in that regard. \nOther than testing Taproot, a lot of work has gone towards improving BasicSwap's\nback-end code ahead of its Open Beta.

This week has been one where we've focused on fixing a tricky issue with Particl Marketplace and have been exploring how best to release Particl Desktop 3.1.</p><p>Indeed, an issue was brought to our attention in which some listing messages are not being received by some markets. The problem seems to be related to two separate issues, but both can occur at the same time. Out of these two issues, one is already fixed but we are still busy investigating the second one especially as it seems to deal with the way the marketplace validates the incoming listing messages and, for some reason, appears to be working on some machines correctly but not on others.

Indeed, it now appears that it will require significantly more time than expected since it touches on many more components of both Particl Desktop and the marketplace back-end code.</p><p>In other words, we cannot currently give any estimation yet on when this might be ready and, for this reason, we've begun exploring releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 without that feature. In fact, we do not want to drag the release of Particl Desktop 3.1 for too long. After releasing Particl V3 on mainnet, we've opted to go ahead with more frequent releases and we intend on sticking to that commitment. </p><p>That being said, even without digital items delivery being included in the next Particl Desktop update, we'll see the introduction of a few new features as well as a large number of bug/issue fixes and general improvements. Among them, we can count on the addition of a seller-adjustable escrow ratio and various important seller-focused improvements, notably many new options for importing inventories and editing, in bulk, listing prices. The vast majority of these additions have been suggested by Particl Marketplace sellers themselves and should fix some of the most obvious pain points for them.</p><p>As we are giving a final look at what is still required to add the digital items delivery feature, we'll let you know, in next week's progress report, whether we've decided to release V3.1 with or without it. </p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-progress-report\">Particl Desktop Progress Report</h2><ul><li>Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes, etc.). <strong>This task is in progress but is proving to be much more time-consuming than initially expected. </strong>For this reason, we may de-prioritize this task in favour of the other two and release Particl Desktop 3.1 without it<strong>.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
