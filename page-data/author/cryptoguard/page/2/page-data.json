we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nNew Update is Live ✅\nBasicSwap Version 0.14.2 and GUI 3.1.1 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 3.1.1 user\ninterface and 0.14.2 codebase are now available, featuring a wide range of\nimprovements across the board.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-version-0-14-2-and-gui-3-1-1-now-available/]\nEarlier this week, we've pushed a new production build of BasicSwap live on the \nmaster branch.

Here are some of the key items under consideration:\n\n * Multiple messaging backends (as fallback network after SMSG),\n * Light nodes integration (users can choose between running a full node or a\n   light one),\n * Network-wide, decentralized reputation, including node gossip mechanism,\n * \"SMSG2\"; tentative name for a new, improved mixnet focused on both privacy\n   and scalability, optimized for Particl marketplace and BasicSwap use-cases,\n * New \"Quick Swaps (Taker)\" page, which filters, sorts, and aggregates offers\n   for a given pair and allows for \"market buy/sell orders\" across multiple\n   offers. This is part of a broader series of new or improved pages intended\n   for BasicSwap (Quick Swaps, (new) create new offers, (new) order book with\n   separated buy/sell offers and market depth chart),\n * A series of other items which may be resolved or worked on before the above\n   mentioned ones (e.g., better market making functions within the GUI, various\n   bug fixes and improvements, etc).\n\nAll these updates are designed to be cross-compatible with renewed, upcoming\ndevelopment on the Particl Marketplace, especially considering its future\nmulti-coin, agnostic architecture.\n\nOver the past few months, our primary focus has been on making progress to\nBasicSwap's codebase. However, we're now reaching a stage where we can begin\nimplementing major features and functionalities that will be seamlessly portable\nto the Particl Marketplace — effectively making them improvements for both\nplatforms.\n\nAs a result, depending on the development path we choose, some of these features\nmay ultimately be categorized not as BasicSwap-specific updates, but rather as\nbroader deliverables applicable to both of Particl’s decentralized applications.\n\nStay tuned for more details as they become available!\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/_pivx/status/1880253744098504943?t=LI9iJs6X0Mda7u4EzP0qTA]Don't\nmiss our upcoming Privacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX and\nFiro this coming 22nd of January at 2:00 PM GMT as we pass in review the year\n2024 and kickoff the new one! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nDogecoin (DOGE) is now available for testing on the dev branch. Please note that\nthis integration uses an experimental, custom-built core version specifically\ndesigned for BasicSwap compatibility. As a result, it may not always align with\nupstream changes, and features unrelated to BasicSwap might function differently\nthan expected.\n\nDue to Dogecoin's lack of SegWit support, secret hash swaps are not possible\nwith this implementation. Consequently, direct swaps between DOGE and privacy\ncoins like Monero and Wownero are currently unavailable, though we are working\ntoward a resolution of this issue.\n\nMaster Release Imminent ✅\nMost of this week has been dedicated to preparing additional features for\nBasicSwap's next master release.

look back at what\nwe've achieved in the past few days and see what we've got to look forward to in\nthe week to come.\n\nNote that last week's progress was slightly slower than usual due to the\nholidays and spending a few days with family and friends. Regular development\npace has now resumed.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are ready to merge the Dogecoin (DOGE) integration into the dev branch for\ncommunity testing, which will occur within the next few hours or during the\nweekend.\n\nDue to Dogecoin's unique codebase, we've developed a custom core package to\nenable integration. We're seeking additional community testers to thoroughly\nevaluate this implementation before its production release. It's important to\nnote that this DOGE integration will be classified as 'experimental' since it\nuses our custom core rather than the official one. This custom version was\nnecessary to implement functions required by BasicSwap that are absent from the\nofficial core.\n\nFurthermore, due to Dogecoin's lack of SegWit support, it will only be available\nas a scriptless coin. This means it cannot be swapped directly with Monero,\nWownero, or other non-scriptable coins. While we're investigating potential\nsolutions to this limitation, implementing the necessary changes may ultimately\ndepend on the Dogecoin development team.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nWe're expanding the local reputation system announced in last week's update with\nmore user-friendly features. These include a new tagging system that color-codes\nSMSG ID addresses on the order book and replaces them with user-defined labels\nwhen saved in contacts. We're also developing an improved identity page that\nfunctions more like a contact management system, making identity handling more\nintuitive.\n\nAlso, planning has begun for our network-wide reputation system, which will\nadapt much of the local reputation logic but operate at the node level. While\nimplementing decentralized reputation presents significant challenges, we've\ndesigned an elegant solution. However, it requires additional refinement to\naddress potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThough implementation isn't immediate, this network-wide reputation system\nrepresents one of our next major developments for BasicSwap. We'll provide more\ndetailed information once we begin active development.\n\nMaster Update ✅\nWe're preparing for the next BasicSwap production update, scheduled for release\naround next week. In preparation, we're completing various smaller tasks from\nour development list and will dedicate the next few days to minor bug fixes and\nimprovements.\n\nWatch for an upcoming Particl News blog post that will detail all the new\nfeatures and improvements in this update!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

taken the time to\nenjoy the holidays as much as possible and that you're well rested. ?\n\nOn our end, progress never stops, even during holidays, and we'd like to take a\nmoment to look back at what we've achieved in the past few days and see what\nwe've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are still in the final stages of the DOGE integration, with only a few\nremaining additions to complete, as well as proper testing to ensure they behave\nas expected in all cases, but we are now indeed in the final stage of the\nprocess.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nPrivate orderbook display + Identity stats + Various fixes. by gerlofvanek ·\nPull Request #193 · basicswap/basicswapUI: Added private orderbook display in\nthe network offers / your offers table. (Based on) To send a private\noffer:Recipient creates a new address to receive offers on.Recipient sends the\npubkey ...GitHubbasicswap [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/193]We've\nnow completed development of a new GUI feature that enables swap capabilities —\na functionality that has been available in the back-end for some time but lacked\nan intuitive user interface.\n\nAlongside private swap capabilities, we're introducing the first iteration of\nlocal identity reputation, a system that tracks your swap history and stats with\nspecific trading partners.\n\nOn BasicSwap, users can either generate a new identity for each swap to maximize\nprivacy, or they can choose to reuse the same identity to build reputation and\nrelationships with fellow traders.\n\nThe new GUI simplifies reputation building by providing clear statistics on each\nidentity used by your trading partners.\n\nIt's important to note that this initial reputation model is exclusively local —\nthe statistics displayed only reflect your personal interaction history with\neach user. This data remains on your device and is not broadcast to the network,\nensuring that privacy is maintained and no data is leaked.\n\nWhile we have plans for a more comprehensive, network-wide, node-based\nreputation system in the future, this week's implementation represents a\nsignificant step toward providing more reputation data on BasicSwap.\n\nFor users planning to act as market makers, liquidity providers, or frequent\ntraders on BasicSwap, we recommend considering whether building reputation with\none or more identities could benefit your trading strategy and help you build\ntrust with quality traders.\n\nThese new features — private swaps and local reputation — are now available in\nthe dev branch and will be merged into master with the next major BasicSwap\nproduction update.\n\nBetter Identity Management ?\nIn addition to the private swaps and local reputation capabilities, we've also\nimproved how identities are managed in the GUI, notably with better displaying\nand organizing of your identities and of BasicSwap's ability to add\ncomprehensive labels to the identities of other swappers.\n\nWhile this week's update is relatively modest when it comes to improvements made\nto identity management, we intend on delivering more updates on that front\nmoving forward as it is key to some of the larger features planned for\nBasicSwap.\n\nCodebase and Other General Improvements ?\nSeveral additional commits have been merged into the dev branch, encompassing\nboth back-end and front-end improvements. These changes include:\n\n * Prevent users from removing Particl Core from the activated coins, as it\n   breaks BasicSwap due to the SMSG requirements (link\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/ec21ea05bf2d7a4faa51319aa9ca5892d266a75e]\n   )\n * Make prepare.py executable (link\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/8582dc479bd3f5e4a740266668b6697c229d440f]\n   )\n * Dependencies updates (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/5d0c7d28e4cb3a5d86396e8251ffe7bd19b89147]\n   , 2\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/059356ccd832916bdfbeff630844b2e7394d6c93]\n   )\n * Ignore unknown coin types in getCachedWalletsInfo (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/54f56e0e2c4c4d394878acdc3eacfdde226fa72a]\n   )\n * Minor Wownero-related fix reverting an output distribution error (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/d88f5728a4d3db398167cc56c292d775ab7d2237]\n   )\n\nWownero Updates ?\nwownero: v0.11.3.0 · basicswap/basicswap@6d66ee8Basic Atomic Swap Proof of\nConcept.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are in the final stages of the DOGE integration, with only a few remaining\nadditions to complete.\n\nWe're still testing the various components of this integration to ensure they\nbehave as expected in all cases, but we are now indeed in the final stage of the\nprocess.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nWe're completing development of a new GUI feature that enables private trading\ncapabilities — a functionality that has been available in the back-end for some\ntime but lacked an intuitive user interface.\n\nPrivate Offers (WIP)Private offers are coming to BasicSwap DEX, allowing users\nto publish offers visible only to specifically authorized parties. These offers\nwill appear in the authorized users' order books with a private tag, indicating\ntheir exclusive nature.\n\nThis feature will soon be available in the dev branch, and we'll provide updates\nas development progresses.\"\n\nWebsockets for Live Updates ?\nWe have completed the integration of websockets into BasicSwap, enabling instant\norder book updates rather than relying on timed refreshes.\n\nThis improvement is crucial as we move toward making BasicSwap's order book more\ndynamic and visually similar to centralized exchanges, with buy/sell side splits\nand depth chart functionality.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress on following items outlined\npreviously:\n\n * Development of a new \"quick swap\" page\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-06-12-2024/#quick-swaps-] \n   that allows users to more easily and accurately swap cryptocurrencies\n * Implementing server-side caching for rate and percentage calculations (in\n   progress, experimental)\n * Standardized modal system; replacing JavaScript popups with consistent,\n   global modal components\n * Various other tweaks and improvements\n\nBasicSwap and Particl in the Media ?️\nPrivacy Roundtable w/ Rachel Rose O'Leary ?️\nThis week's Privacy Roundtable featured a special discussion with Rachel-Rose\nO'Leary from Lunar Punk, joined by our friends from PIVX and Firo. If you missed\nthe live broadcast, you can watch the full episode at the link below.\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/firoorg/status/1869380929896194489]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are still working on the DOGE integration, which ended up taking a bit more\ntime than expected due to its peculiar codebase.\n\nHowever, we're happy to report that we've successfully implemented the majority\nof the possible swap paths using adaptor signature swaps and that the coin now\npasses most of the integration tests.\n\nWe're still testing the integration to ensure it behaves as expected in all\ncases, but it seems that we are now in the

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are currently working through some of the challenges

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMassive Update is Live ?\nBasicSwap Version 0.14.2 and GUI 3.1.1 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 3.1.1 user\ninterface and 0.14.2 codebase are now available, featuring a wide range of\nimprovements across the board.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-version-0-14-2-and-gui-3-1-1-now-available/]\nEarlier today, we've released a massive BasicSwap update that represents weeks\nof dedicated effort, incorporating numerous improvements, bug fixes, and new\nfeatures.\n\nAfter 112 commits from 6 different contributors, it welcomes Bitcoin Cash and\nimplements several key improvements across all aspects of the platform,\nincluding changes to the codebase, the user interface, and to individual coin\nintegrations such as Monero.\n\nNotably, a key technical change is the complete replacement of SQLAlchemy with\nmanbearpigSQL, our custom-built hybrid database system. This transition\nsimplifies BasicSwap's data management processes while solidifying security by\neliminating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis release took most of our time this week as we wrapped up several items for\nit. For more information and the full changelog, refer to the announcement blog\npost here\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-version-0-14-2-and-gui-3-1-1-now-available/].\n\nDogecoin Integration ?\nprobably nothing by nahuhh · Pull Request #175 · basicswap/basicswapGitHub\nbasicswap [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/175]Community contributor\nOfrnxmr has begun work on integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) into BasicSwap,\nindependent of today's update.\n\nWhile this might appear to be a straightforward integration, DOGE's legacy\ncodebase presents several technical challenges that we're currently working to\nresolve.\n\nWe'll continue to provide updates on the progress of this integration as\ndevelopment continues.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nAlthough not yet re-released, the installer release remains imminent. There are\nstill a few things to wrap up before the release, and we'll finish up those now\nthat the BasicSwap DEX update has gone live.\n\nHowever, we want to clarify that this installer is simply a convenience tool to\nfacilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on Windows. For Windows users, we\ncontinue to recommend using the Docker version, which remains our only\nofficially supported Windows implementation.

112 commits coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2], we are\nexcited to announce the release of BasicSwap version 0.14.2, along with an\nupdate to its user interface, now at version 3.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, and new features. The changes stem from\nextensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a\nsignificant step forward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nThis update welcomes Bitcoin Cash and implements several key improvements across\nall aspects of the platform, including changes to the codebase, the user\ninterface, and to individual coin integrations such as Monero.\n\nNotably, a key technical change is the complete replacement of SQLAlchemy with\nmanbearpigSQL, our custom-built hybrid database system. This transition\nsimplifies BasicSwap's data management processes while solidifying security by\neliminating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nWe extend special thanks to Ofrnxmr, Mbacoinin, and mainnet_pat for their code\ncontributions this month, as well as to our dedicated community members who have\nhelped identify bugs and areas for improvement through thorough testing and\nfeedback.

There are\nstill a few things to wrap up before the release, and we'll finish up those\nright after the next master release of BasicSwap which should go live in the\nnext couple of days.\n\nHowever, we want to clarify that this installer is simply a tool to facilitate\nbuilding BasicSwap DEX from source on Windows. For Windows users, we continue to\nrecommend using the Docker version, which remains our only officially supported\nWindows implementation. We do not recommend running BasicSwap directly on\nWindows.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nTalk and Panel at Monerotopia 2024 ?\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/monerujowallet/status/1857109571258515544]The Particl and\nBasicSwap DEX team attended the 2024 edition of Monerotopia in Mexico City this\nweek, where we presented a talk on BasicSwap DEX and our road towards its V1.0\nversion and beyond.\n\nRight after the talk, we were invited to participate on an all-star panel with\nco-panelists Vik Sharma and SethForPrivacy from Cake Wallet, Woodser from\nHaveno, and representatives from Monejuro and EdgeWallet, on the topic of\n\"building bridges to Monero\".\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/DouglasTuman/status/1857921844621488580]The video of the panel is\nnow live, and the video of the talk should be made available soon by the\norganizers of the event.\n\nWe'd like to thank, once again this year, Doug and Sunita for yet another\nincredible event, and we look forward for next year's Monerotopia as well as\nother related events.\n\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/_PIVX/status/1859610995863199909]If\nyou've missed yesterday's Privacy Roundtable with our friends from PIVX, Firo,\nand Zcash, make sure to spin up the playback available here\n[https://x.com/_PIVX/status/1859610995863199909].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate, though we've got exciting and exclusive news to share.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nAs announced earlier today on X by mainnet_pat\n[https://x.com/mainnet_pat/status/1857335162125648102], one of the main\ncontributors to the BCH <> XMR atomic swap protocol, the integration of Bitcoin\nCash on BasicSwap DEX has been extensively tested on mainnet and is now ready\nfor release.\n\nWe have thus merged a substantial series of commits\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35] \nto the dev branch (more specifically, commits dated today November 15th),\nenabling users to test the Bitcoin Cash integration on mainnet. We anticipate\nbringing this integration to the master branch during our next dev -> master \nmerge.\n\nCommits · basicswap/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\nbasicswap/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35]\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to mainnet_pat for his exceptional work on this\nintegration. This valuable community contribution strengthens BasicSwap's\ndecentralized approach and represents another significant step toward achieving\nour mission.\n\nBasicSwap Codebase Improvements ✅\nAlong with today's large array of commits that have been added to the dev \nbranch, we've included a number of general codebase improvements and code\nclean-ups.\n\nNotably, we've resolved an issue with Monero wallets which should resolve a\nlong-standing issue that made BasicSwap become slower the longer you had been\nrunning your instance. This fix is a combination of BasicSwap improvements and\naccompanying fixes that have been published as pull requests to Monero earlier\ntoday (1 [https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9571], 2\n[https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9570]).\n\nOther updates, committed on November 15th\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev], include:\n\n * Large code formatting update, including tests (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555]\n   , 2\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/7b03ce476997ceee5f6b227c8a1b028175ed5b74]\n   )\n * Allow setting reserve below increment for market making script (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/373525b364249c493cc4dbd90fcfd62c38f009ff]\n   )\n * basicswap-prepare: don't start daemon if coin config exists in basicswap.json\n   (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/6be9a14335ac5b7893b231fd33983462bf90a93c]\n   )\n * Bypass Tor for .local domains (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b484827c15fdc306a9dc8b6ce52117371142dcc0]\n   )\n * Fix error when txid is unknown (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/51c11793265045edce7239372748dc74cfea2664]\n   )\n * Fix unbound error when no wallet data is cached (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b5f6eb65262fed1b731003b8248e34db57a32b45]\n   )\n * Adjust wallet name for Particl anon and blind interfaces (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/e28d41ed0caf4c3c28e6fbbf4d3385b48f7f38d6]\n   )\n * Add display_name to chainparams (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/00d70f8cc72096f6f132d108a453d0512ad22c47]\n   )\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWhile we have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer as\nreported last week, we've chosen to focus this week's front-end efforts on\nBasicSwap GUI updates. These updates will begin rolling out to the dev branch in\ngreater numbers over the next few days.\n\nThe installer release remains imminent. However, we want to clarify that this\ninstaller is simply a tool to facilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on\nWindows. For Windows users, we continue to recommend using the Docker version,\nwhich remains our only officially supported Windows implementation.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nAutomated Marketplace Content Moderation ?\nDecentralized Moderation Meets Local AIDiscover the new automated, LLM-powered\nParticl Marketplace moderation script.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]Earlier today, we\npublished the open-source code for the automated, LLM-powered Particl\nMarketplace content moderation script. \n\nThis helper script, which aims to streamline marketplace moderation by shifting\nthe moderation burden from end-users to more engaged community members (though\nend-users can still participate in content moderate as before), is built using\nPython and is available across Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms.\n\nFor detailed insights into the system's architecture, check out our latest blog\npost here [https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]. Ready\nto get started? The setup guide is available in our Github README here\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script/blob/master/README.md]\n.\n\nWe encourage you to try this new proactive moderation approach and share your\nfeedback. We're particularly excited about how this solution bridges two\ntransformative technologies - cryptocurrencies and LLMs - to address the complex\nchallenge of unbiased content moderation in decentralized systems.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nWe've continued assisting mainnet-pat with his Bitcoin Cash integration into\nBasicSwap, notably focusing on a few edge cases and the \"mercy path\". \n\nYou can keep track of some of the development on that end by monitoring\nTecnovert's fork of BasicSwap (here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/bch_staging/]), which serves as\na testing ground for features and updates that will later on make it to the\nofficial BasicSwap repository.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWe have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer following\nextensive testing this week. However, we haven't been able to release it just\nyet, though we expect it to go live very shortly.\n\nFor context, we've adopted a new approach to the setup wizard that simplifies\nits flow and handles the installation process differently. This redesign aims to\nreduce potential failures that can occur across various Windows configurations.\n\nNew Display Type for Orders ?\nAs part of BasicSwap's current development cycle, we're reimagining the order\nbook display by introducing a new visualization option for available offers.\n\nWhile continuing to source data from the same network offers, the new interface\nwill more closely resemble traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing\nmoderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core\nvalues of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden\non users.\n\nBuilt using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It\nanalyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models,\nrequiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your\ndata stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively\nto Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing\nenvironment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or\nvirtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.\n\nYou can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: \nhttps://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\n\nHow We Got Here: The Current Moderation System\nThis release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system\n(v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users'\nhands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the\nplatform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and\npro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.\n\nThe current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some\nconceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial\ndifferences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users\nencounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the\napplication, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public\nlist where the community can either support the original flag through additional\ndownvotes or contest it with upvotes.\n\nContent removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary\ndecisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of\nParticl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply\nof 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000\ncoins to be removed.\n\nImportantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since\nParticl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple\naddresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the\nvoting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated\nwithin an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote\ncarries.\n\nAddressing Current Limitations\nWhile this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its\ncontinued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:\n\nFirst, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain\neffective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can\nlead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.\n\nSecond, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must\nbe exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it.\nWhile early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary\ntrade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant\nbarrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.\n\nThese challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to\ndecentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving\nthe marketplace experience.\n\nThe Promise of Local LLM Technology\nThe breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology.\nWhile the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT,\nAnthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's\nprivacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean\nhigher total API costs.\n\nIndeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models.\nThese models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving\naccuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever\nconnecting to third-party service providers.\n\nThis technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve\nParticl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without\ncompromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through\nAPIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced\nscaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.\n\nThe New Automated Moderation Script\nGitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered\ncontent moderation script for Particl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without\nconnections to 3rd-parties.Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for\nParticl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without connections to 3rd-parties. -\ncryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-scriptGitHubcryptoguard\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script]We’re proud to\nintroduce, today, a new script that automates the process of moderating Particl\nMarketplace content with minimal user input.\n\nOperating Modes\nThe script offers two distinct approaches to marketplace moderation: manual mode \nand continuous mode.\n\nScript's main menuIn manual mode, you maintain complete control through a CLI menu interface that\nlets you oversee each step of the process. This gives you the ability to review\nand adjust moderation decisions before they reach the network, making it\nespecially valuable during your initial setup phase or when testing new\nmoderation rules.\n\nOptions for the script's manual modeContinuous mode transforms this process into an autonomous operation. The script\nindependently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings,\nanalyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the\nnetwork. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace\nscan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces\nuser exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only\nafter thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.\n\nRule System and Analysis\nAt the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule\nsystem powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor\nmarketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria.\nEach rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving\nyou precise control over the moderation process.\n\nThe system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language\ndescriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters.\nTo help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules\naccessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing\nimmediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can\nuse them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or\nentirely replace them with custom rules of your own.\n\nFor those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of\ntest listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to\nprohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the\ntest. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules\nbefore deploying them in the live marketplace.\n\nThe Judgement Engine\nProcessed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely\nuser-defined)The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to\ncontent analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and\ndescriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than\nusing potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when\nclassifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true',\n'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible\nand unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without\npredetermined assumptions.\n\nModel Selection and Performance\nAfter extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the\noptimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates\nremarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including\nseveral state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being\nvictim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it\nto run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to\nvirtual private servers.\n\nOur commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making\neffective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge.\nWe're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to\nfurther optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains\nunclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if\nany.\n\nWallet Configuration\nThe script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin controlTo operate\neffectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an\nactive Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up\nyour wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.\n\nThe first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which\nstreamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a\nParticl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves\nspecifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and\ninitializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and\nNode Settings/Initialize Wallet).\n\nThe initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It\nincorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling\nsecure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for\nboth accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system.\nWithout proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings\nor cast votes on content.\n\nVote Broadcasting System\nThe process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach\ndesigned to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the\nfirst time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the\nLLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu,\nwhere you can examine each decision in detail.\n\nDuring this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated\ndecisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves\nparticularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique\ncontent patterns.\n\nOnce satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting\nprocess through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in\nyour wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins\ncontained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically,\nensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the\nintegrity of your voting decisions.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use this application without running a local model? \nA: Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU\nnetwork running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option\nin the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider\navailability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the\ncommunity-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation\nperformance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this\nspace for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent\ncompromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its\nminimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like\nRaspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.\n\nQ: How is my data and privacy protected? \nA: Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script\nconnects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data\ncollection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision\nencoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which\naddresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy\nand data security principles, which guided the script's development.\n\nQ: What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? \nA: Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we\nemphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new\nmoderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until\nyou're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides\nan excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM\ninterprets different content types.\n\nQ: Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? \nA: Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority.\nBuilt using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The\ninstallation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all\ndependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's\nexisting Python packages or other software.\n\nQ: What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous\nmode? \nA: The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it\nto resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will\nautomatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime,\nensuring no content goes unprocessed.\n\nQ: How much storage space does the local LLM model require? \nA: The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The\nscript's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies,\nneed roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about\n2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to\naccommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.\n\nQ: What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? \nA: For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:\n\n * RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)\n * Storage: 6GB free space\n * Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity\n\nNote: The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be\nsignificantly reduced.\n\nQ: How does the script handle network connectivity issues? \nA: The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the\nmarketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at\nregular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored\nlocally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and\nprocesses any listings it missed during the downtime.\n\nQ: Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? \nA: Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their\nown wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each\ninstance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool\naccording to its wallet's stake.\n\nQ: How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? \nA: The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config\ndirectory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the\nrules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or\nused to recover your setup if needed.\n\nQ: Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data? \nA: No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond\nthe expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings\nthan what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided\ntest listings (available from the CLI menu).\n\nQ: How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? \nA: LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and\ninitiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become\navailable, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided\nthat you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).\n\nLooking Forward\nThe release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in\ndecentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve\neffective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy,\ndecentralization, and user autonomy.\n\nThis development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It\nshows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while\nminimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized\ncontrol. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and\nits privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other\ndecentralized projects facing similar challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community\nfeedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the\npotential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates,\nand further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even\nmore efficient and user-friendly.\n\nYour feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this\ntool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in\ndecentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with\ndifferent rules, and share your experiences with the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible and unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without predetermined assumptions.</p><h3 id=\"model-selection-and-performance\"><strong>Model Selection and Performance</strong></h3><p>After extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the optimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates remarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including several state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being victim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it to run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to virtual private servers.</p><p>Our commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making effective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge. We're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to further optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains unclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if any.</p><h3 id=\"wallet-configuration\"><strong>Wallet Configuration</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"406\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-15.png 669w\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png\" width=\"668\" height=\"401\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16.png 668w\"></div></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"409\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-16_1.png 666w\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png\" width=\"661\" height=\"402\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-07_22-17.png 661w\"></div></div></div><figcaption><em>The script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin control</em></figcaption></figure><p>To operate effectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an active Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up your wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.</p><p>The first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which streamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a Particl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves specifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and initializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and Node Settings/Initialize Wallet).</p><p>The initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It incorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling secure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for both accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system. Without proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings or cast votes on content.</p><h3 id=\"vote-broadcasting-system\"><strong>Vote Broadcasting System</strong></h3><p>The process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach designed to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the first time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the LLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu, where you can examine each decision in detail.</p><p>During this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated decisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves particularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique content patterns.</p><p>Once satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting process through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in your wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins contained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically, ensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the integrity of your voting decisions.</p><h1 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1><p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I use this application without running a local model? <br><strong>A: </strong>Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU network running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option in the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider availability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the community-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation performance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this space for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent compromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its minimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like Raspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is my data and privacy protected? <br><strong>A:</strong> Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script connects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data collection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision encoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which addresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy and data security principles, which guided the script's development.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? <br><strong>A:</strong> Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we emphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new moderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until you're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides an excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM interprets different content types.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority. Built using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The installation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all dependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's existing Python packages or other software.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous mode? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it to resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing moderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core values of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden on users.</p><p>Built using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It analyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models, requiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your data stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively to Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing environment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or virtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.</p><p><strong>You can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\">https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script</a></strong></p><h2 id=\"how-we-got-here-the-current-moderation-system\"><strong>How We Got Here: The Current Moderation System</strong></h2><p>This release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system (v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users' hands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the platform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and pro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p><p>The current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some conceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial differences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users encounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the application, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public list where the community can either support the original flag through additional downvotes or contest it with upvotes.</p><p>Content removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary decisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of Particl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply of 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000 coins to be removed.</p><p>Importantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since Particl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple addresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the voting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated within an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote carries.</p><h2 id=\"addressing-current-limitations\"><strong>Addressing Current Limitations</strong></h2><p>While this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its continued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:</p><p>First, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain effective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can lead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.</p><p>Second, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must be exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it. While early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary trade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant barrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.</p><p>These challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to decentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving the marketplace experience.</p><h2 id=\"the-promise-of-local-llm-technology\"><strong>The Promise of Local LLM Technology</strong></h2><p>The breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology. While the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean higher total API costs.</p><p>Indeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models. These models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving accuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever connecting to third-party service providers.</p><p>This technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve Particl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without compromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through APIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced scaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.</p><h1 id=\"the-new-automated-moderation-script\">The New Automated Moderation Script</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for Particl Marketplace.

Setting up your wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.</p><p>The first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which streamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a Particl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves specifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and initializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and Node Settings/Initialize Wallet).</p><p>The initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It incorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling secure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for both accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system. Without proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings or cast votes on content.</p><h3 id=\"vote-broadcasting-system\"><strong>Vote Broadcasting System</strong></h3><p>The process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach designed to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the first time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the LLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu, where you can examine each decision in detail.</p><p>During this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated decisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves particularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique content patterns.</p><p>Once satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting process through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in your wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins contained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically, ensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the integrity of your voting decisions.</p><h1 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1><p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I use this application without running a local model? <br><strong>A: </strong>Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU network running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option in the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider availability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the community-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation performance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this space for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent compromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its minimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like Raspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is my data and privacy protected? <br><strong>A:</strong> Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script connects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data collection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision encoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which addresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy and data security principles, which guided the script's development.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? <br><strong>A:</strong> Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we emphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new moderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until you're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides an excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM interprets different content types.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority. Built using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The installation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all dependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's existing Python packages or other software.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous mode? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it to resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nMarketplace Moderation Update ?\nWe've rebased the marketplace moderation app in Python for better performance\nand compatibility over Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The rebase is nearly complete\nand we're wrapping up the last few functions and cleaning up the code.\n\nAdditionally, we've tested the moderation system on a wide range of listings,\nboth from Particl Marketplace but also from a large sample of test listings\nwe've curated to test the system against edge cases and more difficult to\ncategorize listings. The performance of the system is quite impressive, with a\n95%+ accuracy rate using template moderation rules (you can set your own rules). \n\nOther than modifying the moderation rules, we're exploring various solutions to\nimprove from that 95%+ mark, although those would have to be implemented after\nthe initial release of the app if they are deem worthy enough.\n\nWe should be ready to release the app within the next two weeks. We'll keep you\nup-to-date on the matter and will accompany the release with a detailed blog\npost that explains how the system works, how to use, and its best practices. \n\nBasicSwap ?\nCodebase ?\nWe've pushed a improvements and bug fixes to the BasicSwap codebase.

Since then, we've continued\nimproving it and have merged portions of it into the dev branch, with more\nmerging to come in the next few days as we're still working on certain items.\n\nHere's what's been merged to the dev today:\n\n * Order book overhaul: implemented dynamic tables for offers (network offers)\n   and sentoffers (your offers), auto-refresh of the order book (without page\n   reloading), and the automated removal of expired offers and new listings,\n * Dynamic filters for tables,\n * Improved shutdown modal,\n * If shutdown created separate modal for in-progress swaps,\n * API: Fixed rate issues with main chart/prices,\n * API: Fixed rate issues with sent/sentoffers table,\n * API: Using one fetch for coins in one batch for all rates,\n * Fixed calculation market rate for profit/loss,\n * Added detailed tooltips for rate and profit/loss,\n * Fixed API calling separate, now using one requests,\n * Included assets (GFX) / implemented price/chart for Bitcoin Cash,\n * Update/fixes on main price chart,\n * Added 1M / 1W / 24H (main price chart),\n * Resolved auto-refresh bug (main price chart),\n * Code refactoring: Full refactor of offers/sentoffers JS,\n * Code refactoring: Full refactor of chart/price JS,\n *  Moved JS out of offers template,\n * Updated the spinning animation for enabling/disabling the auto-refresh chart\n   (now 3 seconds),\n * Added fiat denomination (USD) to the fiat value,\n * Moved fiat denomination to the top and fixed colors for dark theme\n   compatibility, \n * Fixed: Offers appearing multiple times when using filters,\n * Fixed: Filters on offers / sentoffers table.

the week ends, let's take a moment to look back at what we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nMarketplace Moderation Update ?\nThis week, we've conducted more extensive testing of the AI-based moderation\nscript, and we're pleased to report that it's performing exactly as intended\nwith the marketplace. We've also successfully integrated the majority of\nadditional features designed to optimize its user-friendliness.\n\nCurrently, we require a bit more time to evaluate the script's performance\nacross a broader range of test listings. Our goal is to cover as many edge cases\nas possible to ensure robustness.\n\nWe're nearing the stage where we'll be ready to publish a detailed blog post\nexplaining the script's functionality, along with releasing its code.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCodebase ?\nWe've pushed a improvements and bug fixes to the BasicSwap codebase. While these\nchanges are not yet available from the master branch, you can access them by\nbuilding from the dev branch (see here\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/]).\n\n * Updated DASH's version and added backwards compatibility (you can now update\n   your DASH node to the latest version)\n * Refactored seed generation code\n * Refactored basicswap_prepare script\n * Improved daemon management when user already has a certain coin's node set up\n   prior to installing BasicSwap\n * XMR core download automatically resumes if interrupted or fails\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe're finishing up the next batch of GUI updates, fixing a few bugs we've\nencountered, and plan on pushing them live in the next few days. \n\n * Done: Auto refresh (10min) of the chart + coin prices, with enable/disable\n   option.\n * Done: New shutdown modal, featuring a warning message if a swap is in\n   progress\n * Done: Added filter on chart for 30 days / 1 week / 1 day chart.\n * Done: Better offer pagination system\n * Done: User-selectable default coin display on the chart, with Bitcoin as the\n   default if no choice is made\n * Done: Display last refresh time chart.\n * Done: Fixed rate/percentage in offer(s) table.\n * Done: Dynamic network offers table (manually refreshing the page not required\n   anymore)\n * Wrapping up: Implementation of a Tor-compatible API for prices/rates across\n   all templates when Tor is enabled by the user\n * WIP: Adding alert messages when a coin core needs to be upgrade or when a new\n   version of BasicSwap is available (global notification + notification in the\n   wallets page).\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDr. Kap on MoneroTalk's Show ?️\nEarlier this week, Dr. Kap was invited to discuss BasicSwap DEX on MoneroTalk\nahead of the team's attendance at this year's Monerotopia conference.\n\nIf you're in or around Mexico City, make sure to stop by the event and come meet\nthe team!
