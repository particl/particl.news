Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nLast week’s livestream was a special edition as we had the great pleasure to\nwelcome Gerlof van Ek, Particl’s Lead Designer, on the livestream as a guest.\n\nGerlof, more commonly known as Crz within the community, has gained valuable\nexperience working for international companies like Disney, Yves Rocher and\nother major design companies. He’s made a name for himself working and\nfreelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as \nShadowcash, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand\nin EOS (logo/branding), Nexus, CryptoFR [https://cryptofr.com/], BitcoinFR\n[https://bitcoin.fr/], Blocktix, a few exchanges and — of course —Particl, to\nname a few.\n\nGerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is\nin charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about\nGerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at \n2:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s]!\n\n(10:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s]) Could you please elaborate a bit\non the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t\naffected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?\nThe Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually\npretty critical\n[https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362]\n, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the\nlargest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently\nintroduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions,\nmeaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by\nit (for example, PIVX).\n\nAs for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is\nsimply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our\ncore development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this\nvulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential\nTransactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even\nbefore we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been\naffected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of\nour core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this\nclaim!.\n\n(13:48 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s]) Has the Particl UI been designed\nin such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?\nYes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes\nusing HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing two default themes\n, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl\nDesktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings\npage and set up their client to automatically change the theme at a specific\ntime of the day, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by\nthe community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or\nparticularly appreciated by the team.\n\n(15:44 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s]) Gerlof, it’s been said that\nyou’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS),\nso with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as\nopposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?\nParaphrased: Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main\nproject. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an\nidea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see\nhow far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we\nhave a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented\nindividuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and\nmotivating, which makes for a great work environment.\n\n(17:39 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s]) When you first started working\nwith Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer,\npart of the initial team?\nParaphrased: We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come\nand go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The\nvision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on\nit and we found new core members along the way which are now important\ncomponents of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now\nwith around 15 developers actively working on the project and it is amazing to\nsee!\n\nEverything is carefully planned, and we have daily meetings (sometimes more than\none per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a\nreally professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team\nmember we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the\nclock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the\nbackend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking\nParticl to the next level!\n\n(20:31 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s]) Will Particl Desktop’s page\neventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream\npotential?\nYes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl\nDesktop, but we do want to redesign/rebuild the Overview page to change it to a\nmore customizable one with the help of Particl widgets. That is because buyers\nand vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch\nParticl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales\ndata, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their\npurchasing history or favored items.\n\nSimilarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers\nif the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they\ncan immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users\nmight be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues\non ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl\nDesktop a true dashboard.\n\nBecause every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop\nto be very customizable. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is\nto have a complete installer that launches the first time you launch the client.\nThis installer will allow users to choose what decentralized applications they\nwant to be included in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set\ntheir client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user\nmight be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she\ncould disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in\nterms of resources. This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design\ntheir most optimal Particl Desktop setup.\n\n> It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy\ndevelopment phase and mostly a testing environment for now.\nThese are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything\nbeing built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and\neverything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to\ntest the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give\nus as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our #testing\n[https://discord.gg/m27aqEq] or #Open-Development [https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q] \nchannels or directly on the Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. It’s important to try\ndifferent approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and\nwhat doesn’t.\n\nParticl-Desktop — Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\nParticl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\n\n(24:59 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&feature=youtu.be&t=24m59s])\nIs Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?\nYes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example,\nJoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or\n3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a\nton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on\nParticl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese\nfor the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive\nt-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as\na good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d\nlike to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and\ngo-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past\nfew weeks!\n\nParticl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nFriday, October 5, 2018\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\n\nWe also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK\npointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note\nthat we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a\ndesire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage\nanyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact\nus, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve\nalso started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may\nbe hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we\nare still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great\nopportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be\nlooking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and\nbeyond.\n\n(44:03 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s]) Is there a limit to the number of\nlistings Particl Marketplace can support?\nNo! There is no upper limit to how many items Particl Marketplace can support!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Particl Core and Particl Desktop Versions Released\nParticl Core 0.17.0.1 and Desktop 1.3 are released\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nToday, Particl Core 0.17.0.1 was released on the heels of Bitcoin Core 0.17.0\nreleased yesterday.\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\n\nWe’ve released yesterday two major updates to our clients: Particl Desktop 1.3,\nand Particl Core 0.17.0.1. Both these updates are important, especially for\nParticl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in\nour usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days\nor weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a\nreleased it ahead of time.\n\nMost of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue\nrelated. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop\nv1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) automatically on\nrestart.\n\n> It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to\nimmediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with\nCore 0.17.0.1.\nNote: If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman\napp by navigating to its folder and executing the “git pull” command (without\nthe “ ”). You might also be requested to update your Core node by executing the\n“./partyman update” command (again, without the “ ”).\n\nNew Status Report Out\nParticl.io — StatusReport [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nwww.particl.io [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\n\nAs is now tradition, a new Status Report has been released last Friday just\nbefore we’ve started streaming. While not entirely different from previous\nreports, there are still a few interesting developments worth pointing out. For\none, the report shows that the escrow refactoring and enhancement process has\nbeen completed.\n\nA one week old preview of the current Particl’s testnet environmentThe report\nalso shows the team has started adding coin weight to the governance mechanism,\nmeaning that soon enough, it will work on a 1 coin = 1 vote basis. Implementing\nthe coin weight is a necessary feature of the governance mechanism to help\nfights spammers and only let users with an actual stake in the platform govern\nit. Coin weight also allows anyone, staker or not, to participate in the\ndemocratic process. For an interesting discussion regarding coin weight, visit\nthis forum thread of an archived discussion some community members and Lead\nParticl Marketplace Developer Ludx had last week on Discord/Telegram:\n\nDebate on Decentralized Voting Methodology Optimization\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nARCHIVED] General Discussion Channel (Discord/Telegram) (28–09–2018) Link:\nhttps://discord.gg/uvSpbQN Lollr: You can’t…\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nparticl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\n\nAdditionally, following some requests from the community on Telegram, we’ve\nbegun working on a Support & Help tab which will guide and help new users,\nespecially those not very experienced with crypto, in using Particl Desktop.\nThis is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy\nto use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started\nworking on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its\nlifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.\n\nAs usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code\nbeing refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience\nsmoother and more user-friendly. To get more details about the development\nprogress, please refer to our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nNoteworthy Github Activity\nAside from the Status Report, Github [http://github.com/particl] is always the\nbest place to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest developments.

Once again, we’ve had a very high participation rate with around 90\nsubmissions from 18 different users. As suggested by some community members,\nwe’ve decided to change the rules a little bit and have a jury composed of team\nmembers handpick the best slogans and put them up for vote. This should reduce\n“user fatigue” when confronted with too many options, and hopefully will result\nin a higher voting participation rate.\n\nThe contest ends next Monday, so if you had a slogan in mind and haven’t posted\nit yet, now is the time to do it!\n\nNew Video & Article from CryptoRamble\nThe Startling Secret Between Google and MasterCard — Crypto Ramble — Medium\n[https://medium.com/@cryptoramble/14eb3cfbc172]\nImagine that you are the creator of a useful tool that you think will help\nsociety.

That is because buyers and vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch Particl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue.

We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way.

We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities.

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

He’s made a name for himself working and freelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as <strong>Shadowcash</strong>, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand in <strong>EOS </strong>(logo/branding), <strong>Nexus</strong>, <a href=\"https://cryptofr.com/\"><strong>CryptoFR</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://bitcoin.fr/\"><strong>BitcoinFR</strong></a>, <strong>Blocktix</strong>, a few exchanges and — of course — <strong>Particl</strong>, to name a few.</p><p>Gerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is in charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about Gerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s\"><strong>2:10</strong></a>!</p><h3 id=\"-10-10-could-you-please-elaborate-a-bit-on-the-bitcoin-ddos-bug-that-was-disclosed-how-is-it-possible-particl-isn-t-affected-since-it-s-built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s\">10:10</a>) Could you please elaborate a bit on the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t affected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?</h3><p>The Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually pretty <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362\">critical</a>, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the largest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions, meaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by it (for example, PIVX).</p><p>As for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is simply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our core development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this vulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even before we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been affected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of our core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this claim!.</p><h3 id=\"-13-48-has-the-particl-ui-been-designed-in-such-a-way-that-will-make-it-easy-to-apply-skins-to-it\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s\">13:48</a>) Has the Particl UI been designed in such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?</h3><p>Yes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes using HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing <strong>two default themes</strong>, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl Desktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings page and set up their client to <strong>automatically change the theme at a specific time of the day</strong>, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by the community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or particularly appreciated by the team.</p><h3 id=\"-15-44-gerlof-it-s-been-said-that-you-ve-helped-other-crypto-teams-with-their-graphics-and-branding-such-as-eos-so-with-that-in-mind-what-made-you-choose-to-join-particl-as-a-team-member-as-opposed-to-any-of-the-other-teams-you-ve-worked-with\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s\">15:44</a>) Gerlof, it’s been said that you’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS), so with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as opposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased:</strong> <em>Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main project.

As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

This is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy to use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started working on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its lifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.</p><p>As usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code being refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience smoother and more user-friendly.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
