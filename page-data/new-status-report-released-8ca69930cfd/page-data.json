This new report\ncontains a lot of information about the status of the project’s development as\nwell as a pretty good presentation of the features that are most likely to be\nincluded in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace.\n\nWhat We Are Busy With\nThis section of the report shows what the Particl development team is already\nworking on. These items are currently under active development and are the\nprimary short-term focus points of our developers.\n\nMarketplace\nAs many of you already know, the team is currently heavily focused on developing\nand putting together both the project and marketplace governance systems.\n\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThe project governance system\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] will allow users to\ncreate and submit proposals for the community to vote on. These proposals will\nbe extremely useful to reach consensus within the community in a provably fair\nfashion. This proposal system is required for the community to vote on what to\ndo with the remaining funds in the Community Initiative Fund\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e] \n(~33,000 PART, 100% community-owned).\n\nThe marketplace governance system, on the other hand, is the function that\nallows users to flag undesirable content on Particl Marketplace. As no party\nother than the community itself has moderation powers over the marketplace, this\nfeature is considered an absolute requirement for the marketplace DApp to be\nreleased on mainnet. Indeed, this mechanism gives community moderation powers\nover the content posted on it so that it can stay clean and free of\nreprehensible or spammy content.\n\nAside from both governance systems, there is also quite a few improvements being\nmade to the marketplace based on the various feedback we’ve received from all of\nthe people who have tested the Alpha version. This includes the refactoring of\nseveral aspects of the code, making it much smoother, faster, and intuitive to\nuse, and a few new feature enhancements such as advanced filtering options and\nexpiry time on listed products.\n\nA few items here are actually quite interesting. In fact, the team is currently\nworking on a new hardware wallet integration, Trezor, to give users more options\nwhen it comes to secure storage of funds.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nA major and long-awaited Particl Desktop feature has also started being worked\non [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], namely multi-wallets.\nThis function enables the possibility to set up several different wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is a great feature for both security,\nprivacy, and usability.\n\nTwo Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop InstanceMulti-wallets\nallow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of\nmismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen\nas different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each\nwallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace\nprofiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there\nis no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them,\nthe previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other\nwallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type\nof data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same\nParticl Desktop instance.\n\nThis feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles\nor accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing\nmarketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process.\nUsers can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one\nof them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.\n\nIndeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet,\neven if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each\nstaking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a\ndifferent address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per\nwallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by\nredirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they\nwant (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the\nother 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop\nprojects on the Particl network).\n\nTrezor Integration\nTrezor Hardware WalletWe’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration,\nbut we’re not stopping there. With the goal of providing our users with more\nflexibility by making more options available, we can announce that we have\nstarted working on an integration to the Trezor hardware wallet\n[https://trezor.io/]!\n\n> Trezor is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin\ntransactions. With Trezor, transactions are completely safe even when initiated\non a compromised or vulnerable computer. Because the use of Trezor is very easy\nand intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption among people not familiar\nwith the security issues. —https://wiki.trezor.io/FAQ:Overview\nWaiting for Review\nA few items have been completed and are awaiting the final review before being\nintegrated. Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for\nReview”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade,\nhave been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet\npre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated\nsoon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal\nscreen and notification system for order status changes.\n\nWhat’s on the Horizon — Beta\nThis section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items\nfor the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what\nthe Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the\ndevelopment team will be working in the short to mid-term.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nAs pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are\ngoing to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.\n\nStarting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace\nThis simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode\nonly when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl\nDesktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re\nlaunching it from (~400mb less memory required).\n\nPrivate Markets & Listings\nPrivate markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These\nmarkets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of\nParticl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link\n(usually provided by the market creator).\n\nPrivate listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like\nprivate markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market\nunless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings\nintend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you\nwere to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.\n\nWhile these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they\nare deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed\nwith a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold\nin order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing\nwould be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very\npopular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.\n\nEscrow Enhancements & Deposit Negotiations\nThe decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl\nMarketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the\nvery obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration\nof the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by\nthe NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm.\nOther enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its\nstability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and\nmore.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nAnother needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client\nis a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well\nas various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an\never-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more\noptions as the Particl platform grows.\n\nParticl Software Development Kit\nAnother long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development\ntoolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized\napplications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the\nrelease of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where\noutside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own. We\nfully intend on organizing hack-a-thons and development contests using Particl’s\nSDK, and firmly believe the release of this toolkit will cement Particl as a\nsolid decentralized application platform.\n\nDecentralized Funding & Decentralized Organizations on Particl\nCombining multi-wallets and the Particl SDK will allow people to request\nfundings from Particl stakers for any kind of development actively benefiting\nthe Particl network. While still a few months away from being a real\npossibility, any outside/third-party development team will be able to submit\nformal proposals to the Particl network and request stakers to passively donate\na portion of their staking rewards to a development fund.\n\nThis funding model is quite different than the now popular ICO model, as it\ndoesn’t automatically secure an upfront amount of money to a development team,\ninstead providing a steady but more reasonable stream of funds. This ensures the\ndevelopment teams stay motivated and incentivized to develop the product that\nthey promised the community, which is even truer when the funding itself can be\ncut at any moment by the stakers (they only need to stop redirecting their\nstaking rewards to this project’s development fund).\n\nThis form of funding model also encourages developers to build products that are\nbeneficial to the entire Particl ecosystem itself. That is because decentralized\napplications on Particl will work using the PART coin, at least initially, and\ndo not allow developers to create tokens for themselves and disregard the\nParticl ecosystem as a whole. This is true for stakers as well, redirecting\ntheir staking rewards to a project’s development fund does not award them with\nany kind of token, therefore they will want to donate to projects that are going\nto be directly beneficial to the Particl platform, coin, and ecosystem.\n\nStay Tuned!\nThere is so much development being made on Particl right now, stay tuned for\nmore detailed updates about each of the aforementioned items as they near\nmainnet or testnet implementation. The Status Report is always a good way to\nkeep yourself up-to-date with all development updates surrounding the project.\nDon’t forget to also take a look at our Github page, especially the Pull Request\ntabs of each of our repositories.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-shG0fKUWbiPYc27Fahxn-Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>If you haven’t noticed yet, <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">a new development Status Report has recently been posted on our website</a>.

One of the very obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration of the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm. Other enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its stability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and more.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>Another needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client is a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well as various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an ever-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more options as the Particl platform grows.</p><h2 id=\"particl-software-development-kit\">Particl Software Development Kit</h2><p>Another long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development toolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized applications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the release of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where outside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own.

That is because decentralized applications on Particl will work using the PART coin, at least initially, and do not allow developers to create tokens for themselves and disregard the Particl ecosystem as a whole. This is true for stakers as well, redirecting their staking rewards to a project’s development fund does not award them with any kind of token, therefore they will want to donate to projects that are going to be directly beneficial to the Particl platform, coin, and ecosystem.</p><h2 id=\"stay-tuned-\">Stay Tuned!</h2><p>There is so much development being made on Particl right now, stay tuned for more detailed updates about each of the aforementioned items as they near mainnet or testnet implementation.

Simply head over to this link and follow the\ninstructions: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking. Note that, while the process\ncan currently only be executed from the Particl-Qt client, an actual Particl\nDesktop integration will be coming at a later time.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are very excited to finally announce that as of today, Ledger has officially\nadded support for Particl on their Ledger Live application and Nano S device.\nThis means PART will now be available for cold storage on Nano S hardware\nwallets with cold staking capabilities enabled. This release marks the first\ntime pure PoS coins stored on a hardware device can be safely staked without any\nintermediary nor internet connection required.\n\nTo learn how to use Particl on the Ledger Nano S, follow this simple tutorial on\nour Wiki page: https://particl.wiki/ledger\n\nThe Most Secure Way to Store PART\nNo matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are,\nyou are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you\neither enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device.\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and\ncyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in\nthe total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.\n\nThe Ledged Nano S hardware deviceThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure\nhardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets:\nprivate keys are stored in a protected area of a micro-controller, and cannot be\ntransferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even\nwhen connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\n\nThe World’s Most Secure PoS Protocol\nA vulnerability often associated with PoS is the risk associated with the\nprocess of staking itself. In fact, Proof-of-Stake protocols usually require\nusers to keep their wallets online and “unlocked for staking”. While wallets in\nthat state are still locked and require a password to execute transactions, this\nvery password is stored in the device’s memory so that it can remain “unlocked\nfor staking”. As we’ve seen with the Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this\nyear\n[https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870]\n, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily\nresult in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.\n\nThis issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold\nstaking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which\ncontain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address,\neven coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets.\nThese staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than\nthe end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what\nthis means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake\nexposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility\nis assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be\nleft unencrypted).\n\nThe Ultimate Vulnerability\nHowever, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl\nstakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected\ncomputers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone\ndoes not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter\nhow secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to\neither spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means\nprivate keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for\na brief moment. With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for\nhackers and cyber thieves\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU]\n, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being\naware of it becomes greater. That is even more true as more and more\nvulnerabilities and exploits surrounding the ME Intel chip keep making headlines\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-me-new-firmware-bugs,37492.html].\n\n> Between all the new Spectre-class CPU flaws and the bugs the company and other\nresearchers keep finding for its Management Engine (ME) firmware, Intel can’t\nseem to catch a break. Now the company has publicly disclosed two more ME bugs,\none of which allows remote code execution on victims’ PCs.\nThe ME Intel chip\n[https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html] is a\nproprietary engine that powers hardware features that operate at the baseboard\nlevel, below the operating system. By enabling interaction with low-level\nhardware, this chip gives administrators (or any user that can find practical\nexploits) the ability to perform tasks that previously required someone to be\nphysically present at the desktop. The EFF itself describes the ME Intel chip\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it] \nas a “largely undocumented master controller for your CPU: it works with system\nfirmware during boot and has direct access to system memory, the screen,\nkeyboard, and network”.\n\nSimply put, transacting any coin, PoS or PoW, is something that is exponentially\nbecoming riskier as hackers get more experience in the crypto industry and\nimprove their techniques.\n\nHardware Cold Staking to the Rescue\nSecure Staking Brings Peace of MindThis is where the significance of this Ledger\nNano S integration comes into play as it is coded in such a way that no private\nkey needs to be exchanged between the Ledger Nano S hardware device and the\nclient (Particl-Qt). This means that users will now be able to store funds\nstored on a hardware device and still delegate the hardware wallet’s staking\npowers to a cold staking node.\n\nThis release, as it currently stands, is the first ever successful mainnet\nrelease of a pure PoS hardware cold staking setup, the ultimate solution for\nusers looking at getting the best level of security, flexibility, and\naccessibility without compromising decentralization. You know, when they say you \n“can’t have your cake and it eat too”, well it turns out with Particl you now\ncan!\n\nSecure Decentralized Voting Process\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThis Ledger Nano S integration currently only\nallow users to securely store and stake their funds offline on a hardware\ndevice, but it will also ultimately let users participate in both governance\nmechanisms available on Particl. Indeed, with a bit of additional work, users\nwill be able to use their coins stored on their hardware device to participate\nin both governance system without ever requiring to expose their private key or\npassword on the computer used to register their vote. This ensures that ALL\nParticl users, even those with the highest security standards, can partake in\nthe decentralized governance of the project and its platform. No voice left\nunheard!\n\nExciting Times Lie Ahead\nThis release marks the start of an exciting period for the Particl project as we\nwill start seeing more and more features hit both the testnet and mainnet\nnetworks. After a year or so of being in a deep development phase, the pieces\nare finally starting to come all together leading up to the release of the\nlong-awaited Particl Marketplace on mainnet.\n\nAs a matter of fact, ever since the team meeting in Prague, the team has adopted\nnew, better development and management processes and methodologies and has never\nbeen as effective as it currently is. That much can be noticed directly on our\nGithub page where activity has been soaring and commits are pouring in. It can\nsafely be stated that the development aspect of the project is currently at its\nbest and has never been as steady and effective as it currently is.\n\nContest\nTo celebrate this new security feature, we would like to give away 5 Ledger Nano\nS hardware devices to our community!

They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a protected area of a micro-controller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-secure-pos-protocol\">The World’s Most Secure PoS Protocol</h3><p>A vulnerability often associated with PoS is the risk associated with the process of staking itself. In fact, Proof-of-Stake protocols usually require users to keep their wallets online and “unlocked for staking”. While wallets in that state are still locked and require a password to execute transactions, this very password is stored in the device’s memory so that it can remain “unlocked for staking”. As we’ve seen with the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870\">Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this year</a>, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily result in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.</p><p>This issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold staking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which contain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address, even coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets. These staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than the end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what this means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake exposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility is assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be left unencrypted).</p><h3 id=\"the-ultimate-vulnerability\">The Ultimate Vulnerability</h3><p>However, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl stakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected computers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone does not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter how secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to either spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means private keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for a brief moment. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU\">With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for hackers and cyber thieves</a>, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being aware of it becomes greater.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
