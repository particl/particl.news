Due to changes in the data structure of\nBasicSwap-related SMSG messages, previous instances of the DEX are not\nforward-compatible with this new version. This means that offers posted from\nupdated instances will not appear on older instances. All users must update to\nmaintain full network connectivity.\nAfter 171 commits over 164 files changed coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4], we are\nexcited to announce the release of a significant BasicSwap update (v0.14.4)\nalong with an update to its user interface, now at version 3.2.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, new features, and significant refactors of\ndifferent core components of the system. The changes stem from extensive testing\nby both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step\nforward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nNoteworthy Updates ?\nWhile this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to\nimprove efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several\nsignificant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.\n\nVarious Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX.\nWhether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we\nhighly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.\n\nSignificant UI Refactor ?️\nA major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple\nof weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better\npractices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented\nnumerous UI upgrades, including:\n\n * Local reputation tracking\n * Enhanced order book formatting with additional information\n * New Bids page\n * Improved Swaps in Progress page\n * Better Offer pages\n * More responsive and dynamic page behavior\n * Better rate fetching\n * Much more...\n\nThe interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and\nyou'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.\n\nClient Authentication ?\nWe've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client\nauthentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a\npassword of your choosing. \n\nThis is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the\nmarket-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely\ntrust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation\ndocumentation.\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWe've pushed to master the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support\nfor BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure\nupdate to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called\n\"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages\nacross multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network\nexperiences high load.\n\nSince all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even\nnon-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without\ncompromising user privacy or security.\n\nThis new functionality delivers several key benefits:\n\n 1. Improved platform scalability and resilience\n 2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use\n    their preferred compatible networks for message relay\n 3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to\n    operate on the same network during swaps\n\nWhile the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before\nthe implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using\nSimplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific\nrecipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.\n\nThe core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various\nnetworks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency,\nalthough additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG\nmessages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting\npre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through\nP2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex\nnetworks.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its\nflexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be)\nfully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like\nTelegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols\nare particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth\nnoting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some\ninformation pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each\nother.\n\nAcceptance Strategy Knowledge ?\nWhen publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest\nof the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to\nautomatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page\nbefore submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which\noffers to bid on.\n\nPlease note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be\nable to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your\nBasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However,\noffer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so\nupgrading now carries no downside.\n\nDocs ?️\nWe've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses\nReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at \ndocs.basicswapdex.com [https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/]. While we'll\nmaintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates\nwill be provided at the new location.\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\nDue to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related\nmessages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in\nyour instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.\n\nTo install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface\nupdates, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/user-guides/update] (video walkthrough\n[https://youtu.be/obxcmEby64s?si=-kFNfEIJx8yQYJhP]) and launch the DEX again.\n\nDocker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image (docker-compose stop),\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build --no-cache command,\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\n> Note: Depending on your Docker version, adding a dash between docker and compose \nmay not be necessary and may instead throw an error.\nNon-Docker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the non-Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly,\n * From the ~/coinswaps/basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * Execute the following command: pip install --require-hashes -r\n   requirements.txt,\n * Execute the following command: pip3 install .,\n * Launch BasicSwap as usual.\n\nInstall Script\n> If you've installed BasicSwap using Nahuhh's Github installation script\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/]...\n * Execute the update command: bsx-update && bsx-update.\n\nChangelog ?\nCoin(s)\n * Bitcoin — Added support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets\n * Bitcoin — Update Bitcoins' fast sync blockchain file\n * Bitcoin — Add a workaround to prevent Bitcoin wallets' seeds changing after\n   enabling encryption\n * Bitcoin Cash — Upgraded Bitcoin Cash node to version 28.0.1\n * Bitcoin Cash — Refresh BCH keypool\n * Monero — Upgrade Monero node to version 0.18.4.0\n * Monero — Corrupt Monero wallets are now detected\n * Monero — Remove inaccurate fee rates for Monero and hide sweep all checkbox\n * Monero — Make Monero's fork height a transient error\n * Monero — Sets Monero's trusted_daemon setting to true by default\n * Litecoin — Fixed a bug with MWEB wallet generation\n * PIVX — Fixed issues with PIVX\n * Namecoin — Large array of fixes and improvements to the Namecoin integration\n * Wownero — Fixed Wownero's Windows download URL\n * Fixed a reseed wallet regression error\n\nAPI\n * Better handling of errors with the API\n * Fixed bug with Firo's API\n * Simplified API requests\n * Identities API updated\n * Use CryptoCompare pricemulti endpoint for multiple coins\n * Reduced lookupFiatRates debug message\n\nUI Code\n * Fixed various memory leaks and improved memory efficiency\n * Major UI refactor;

The changes stem from extensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step forward for user experience and platform stability.</p><h2 id=\"noteworthy-updates-\">Noteworthy Updates ?</h2><p>While this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to improve efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several significant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.</p><h3 id=\"various-coin-core-updates-\">Various Coin Core Updates ✅</h3><p>We've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX. Whether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we highly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.</p><h3 id=\"significant-ui-refactor-\">Significant UI Refactor ?️</h3><p>A major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple of weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better practices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented numerous UI upgrades, including:</p><ul><li>Local reputation tracking</li><li>Enhanced order book formatting with additional information</li><li>New Bids page</li><li>Improved Swaps in Progress page</li><li>Better Offer pages</li><li>More responsive and dynamic page behavior</li><li>Better rate fetching</li><li>Much more...</li></ul><p>The interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and you'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.</p><h3 id=\"client-authentication-\">Client Authentication ?</h3><p>We've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client authentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a password of your choosing. </p><p>This is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the market-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely trust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation documentation.</p><h3 id=\"multi-net-support-\">Multi-Net Support ?</h3><p>We've pushed to <code class=\"language-text\">master</code> the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support for BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure update to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called \"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.</p><p>Since all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even non-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without compromising user privacy or security.</p><p>This new functionality delivers several key benefits:</p><ol><li>Improved platform scalability and resilience</li><li>Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use their preferred compatible networks for message relay</li><li>Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to operate on the same network during swaps</li></ol><p>While the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before the implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using Simplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific recipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.</p><p>The core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various networks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency, although additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG messages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting pre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through P2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex networks.</p><p>Not to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its flexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be) fully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like Telegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols are particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth noting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some information pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each other.</p><h3 id=\"acceptance-strategy-knowledge-\">Acceptance Strategy Knowledge ?</h3><p>When publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest of the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to automatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page before submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which offers to bid on.</p><p>Please note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be able to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your BasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However, offer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so upgrading now carries no downside.</p><h3 id=\"docs-\">Docs ?️</h3><p>We've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses ReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at <a href=\"https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/\">docs.basicswapdex.com</a>.

an\nupdate to its user interface, now at version 3.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

the week ends, let's take a moment to look back at what we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nMarketplace Moderation Update ?\nThis week, we've conducted more extensive testing of the AI-based moderation\nscript, and we're pleased to report that it's performing exactly as intended\nwith the marketplace. We've also successfully integrated the majority of\nadditional features designed to optimize its user-friendliness.\n\nCurrently, we require a bit more time to evaluate the script's performance\nacross a broader range of test listings. Our goal is to cover as many edge cases\nas possible to ensure robustness.\n\nWe're nearing the stage where we'll be ready to publish a detailed blog post\nexplaining the script's functionality, along with releasing its code.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCodebase ?\nWe've pushed a improvements and bug fixes to the BasicSwap codebase. While these\nchanges are not yet available from the master branch, you can access them by\nbuilding from the dev branch (see here\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/]).\n\n * Updated DASH's version and added backwards compatibility (you can now update\n   your DASH node to the latest version)\n * Refactored seed generation code\n * Refactored basicswap_prepare script\n * Improved daemon management when user already has a certain coin's node set up\n   prior to installing BasicSwap\n * XMR core download automatically resumes if interrupted or fails\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe're finishing up the next batch of GUI updates, fixing a few bugs we've\nencountered, and plan on pushing them live in the next few days. \n\n * Done: Auto refresh (10min) of the chart + coin prices, with enable/disable\n   option.\n * Done: New shutdown modal, featuring a warning message if a swap is in\n   progress\n * Done: Added filter on chart for 30 days / 1 week / 1 day chart.\n * Done: Better offer pagination system\n * Done: User-selectable default coin display on the chart, with Bitcoin as the\n   default if no choice is made\n * Done: Display last refresh time chart.\n * Done: Fixed rate/percentage in offer(s) table.\n * Done: Dynamic network offers table (manually refreshing the page not required\n   anymore)\n * Wrapping up: Implementation of a Tor-compatible API for prices/rates across\n   all templates when Tor is enabled by the user\n * WIP: Adding alert messages when a coin core needs to be upgrade or when a new\n   version of BasicSwap is available (global notification + notification in the\n   wallets page).\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDr. Kap on MoneroTalk's Show ?️\nEarlier this week, Dr. Kap was invited to discuss BasicSwap DEX on MoneroTalk\nahead of the team's attendance at this year's Monerotopia conference.\n\nIf you're in or around Mexico City, make sure to stop by the event and come meet\nthe team!

sovereignty has been a\ndriving force behind many blockchain projects, but few have come as close to\nrealizing this vision as the Particl Marketplace. \n\nWith its comprehensive ecosystem, Particl aims to create an all-inclusive and\ncircular economy where users can opt-out of the traditional financial system and\nlive completely free from middlemen. \n\nHowever, to achieve this level of independence, a robust and decentralized way\nto trade the platform's native currency, PART, is essential. This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

thrilled to announce a major milestone: the initial phase of integrating\nLitecoin MWEB into BasicSwap DEX. With this latest update, users now have the\nability to send MWEB transactions to MWEB deposit addresses on BasicSwap and\neffortlessly convert coins between standard and MWEB balances.\n\nThis integration marks the first step in our commitment to fully integrate\nLitecoin MWEB atomic swaps into BasicSwap DEX. We are closely following\nLitecoin's upcoming major update — which is required for a full integration of\nMWEB swaps — and plan to incorporate full MWEB swaps as soon as feasible. \n\nOur goal is to support innovation in the cryptocurrency space, especially in\nregards to privacy, data protection, and pro-freedom initiatives, and we are\nconfident that adding Litecoin's MWEB capabilities to our DEX will go a long way\nin making this important privacy contribution from the Litecoin community more\naccessible to a wider audience. \n\nTable of Contents\n * How to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\n * Providing Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\n * (Contest) Win a Physical Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)\n * Dr. Kap to Speak at the Litecoin Summit 2024\n * About Litecoin's MWEB\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\nTo begin using Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap, you need to either install the DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html] \non your computer or update it to the latest version\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n. Detailed instructions for installation and updating can be found at the \nParticl Academy [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/index.html].\n\n> Note: If you're using Windows, you can use our all-in-one .exe installer here\n[https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI] which fully\nautomates the process: \nhttps://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases (latest\ninstaller version)\nOnce installed, navigate to the Wallets page on the DEX where you'll see all the\ncoins you've enabled. To manage your Litecoin wallet, click on the 'Manage\nWallet' button at the top right corner of the Litecoin tile. There, you'll find\nboth your standard and MWEB Litecoin deposit addresses. You can send your coins\nto these addresses as needed.\n\nTo switch coins between standard and MWEB balances, simply make a withdrawal\nfrom one address type to the other. This will create an internal transaction,\neffectively converting your balance between the two states.\n\nFor example, to transfer coins from your standard deposit address to your MWEB\naddress, simply copy and paste your MWEB address into the LTC address field,\nenter the number of LTC you want to transfer, and click on the Withdraw LTC\nbutton.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProviding Liquidity to Litecoin Pairs\nWhile full MWEB swaps aren't yet an option on BasicSwap, you still have the\nability to swap Litecoin using either the Secret Hash method or the more\nprivacy-centric Adaptor Signature protocol for atomic swaps. This means you can\ntrade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX,\nincluding Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.\n\nTo make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a \ncompanion automated market making script\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts]. This tool runs in\ntandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book\nonce they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market\nrate. \n\nAdditionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers\nwith a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for\npassive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.\n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the\ncompanion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is\nextremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your\ncomputer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your\npersonal computer.\n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in\noffsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other\npeople pick up your swap offers.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThe second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This\nallows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated\nmanner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\nand add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential passive\nincome whenever others pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node and providing liquidity to Litecoin pairs entirely effortless\nonce the initial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy\nthe market making script, and earn some sweet passive income as people enjoy\nyour liquidity for their swapping needs.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)\nTo celebrate the launch of Litecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX — the world's safest,\ncheapest and most anonymous decentralized exchange — we're giving away five (5) \n2013 Lealana 1 Litecoin “First Run” bullions, valued at approximately $1,000\neach\n[https://stacksbowers.com/cryptocurrency/litecoin-ltc/#:~:text=Overview%3A%20The%20Lealana%20Litecoin%20series,physical%20bitcoins%20introduced%20in%202011]\n.\n\nTo participate, simply (1) place a bid on the contest listing on Particl's\ndecentralized marketplace dApp (listing title: Particl x Litecoin MWEB Contest),\n(2) like and retweet the contest tweet, and (3) tag three of your friends in the\ntweet's comments section.

Tickets now available.\n[https://www.litecoin.net/summit]We're thrilled to share that Particl and\nBasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap will be presenting on stage at the Litecoin Summit\n2024 [https://www.litecoin.net/summit] in Nashville this summer. His talk will\nfocus on the significant privacy and freedom benefits associated with using\nMWEB-powered Litecoin swaps on BasicSwap DEX, and why this new Litecoin release\nis so significant in light of the current crypto and world events.\n\nIf you're in or around Nashville during the summit, we highly recommend\nattending as it's shaping up to be one of the standout conferences of the year.\nFor more information and to see the impressive list of speakers, click here\n[https://www.litecoin.net/summit].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Litecoin's MWEB on BasicSwap DEX\nLitecoin's MWEB protocol is a significant optional enhancement aimed at\nimproving privacy and scalability, two critical aspects in the world of\ncryptocurrencies. Derived from the name 'MimbleWimble' originating from the\nHarry Potter series, this protocol was initially proposed by an anonymous user\nnamed Tom Elvis Jedusor in a Bitcoin research chatroom, signaling its roots in\nthe broader crypto community.\n\nTechnically, MWEB is distinct because it fundamentally alters how transactions\nare constructed in Litecoin's blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain models,\nwhere individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions\ninto a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential\ntransactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted.\nThe encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the\ntransaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel\napproach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to\nobscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.\n\nThe benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly\nenhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by\nobscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark\ncontrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin,\nwhere transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves\nscalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using\ncryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store\nexcessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the\nnetwork. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making\nLitecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Derived from the name 'MimbleWimble' originating from the Harry Potter series, this protocol was initially proposed by an anonymous user named Tom Elvis Jedusor in a Bitcoin research chatroom, signaling its roots in the broader crypto community.</p><p>Technically, MWEB is distinct because it fundamentally alters how transactions are constructed in Litecoin's blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain models, where individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions into a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential transactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted. The encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the transaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel approach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to obscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.</p><p>The benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly enhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by obscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark contrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin, where transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves scalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store excessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the network. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making Litecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This means you can trade Litecoin for any of the other cryptocurrencies available on the DEX, including Monero, Bitcoin, Particl, and many more.</p><p>To make it easier for you to provide liquidity on the DEX, we've introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/tree/master/scripts\">companion automated market making script</a>. This tool runs in tandem with the DEX, automatically republishing your offers on the order book once they expire and adjusting their prices to align with the current market rate. </p><p>Additionally, you have the option to configure the script to list your offers with a premium over the market rate. This feature provides an opportunity for passive income as others pick up and trade with your offers.</p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first thing we recommend if you intend on providing liquidity via the companion script is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run the automated market making script on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs by setting a premium over the market rate and have other people pick up your swap offers.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up.

Unlike traditional blockchain models, where individual transactions are visible, MWEB combines multiple transactions into a single large transaction. This is achieved by using confidential transactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted. The encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the transaction parties can decrypt the amounts. Moreover, MWEB employs a novel approach called \"CoinJoin,\" which merges multiple payment inputs and outputs to obscure the link between individual transactions, greatly enhancing privacy.</p><p>The benefits of MWEB in Litecoin are substantial. Firstly, it significantly enhances privacy by concealing the amount of Litecoin being transacted and by obscuring the connection between sender and receiver. This feature is a stark contrast to the transparent nature of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin, where transaction details are publicly visible. Secondly, the protocol improves scalability. By condensing multiple transactions into one and using cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store excessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the network. This leads to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, making Litecoin more efficient and practical for everyday transactions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This is achieved by using confidential transactions, which allow the sending and receiving of amounts to be encrypted. The encryption is done using blinding factors, ensuring that only the transaction parties can decrypt the amounts.

By condensing multiple transactions into one and using cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without having to store excessive data on the blockchain, MWEB reduces the amount of data stored on the network.

cryptocurrency for\nanother in full privacy and without any counterparty risk at all. And to top it\nall, it's completely free to use.\n\nThe platform's unique benefits sure are drawing attention, but as it's still in\nthe early stages of development, some users find its quirks a bit challenging to\nwork with. This has unfortunately affected the liquidity available on the DEX's\norder book.\n\nTo help overcome these challenges and improve liquidity, we present you today\ntwo video tutorials that will show you how to smoothly run BasicSwap on a cloud\nserver and automate the process of providing liquidity on the DEX using\nBasicSwap's automated market making script. When combined together, this will\nlet you set your desired spread based on current market prices and potentially\nearn you arbitrage profits whenever other traders pick up your offers.\n\nIf you want to jump straight to the video tutorials, click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAddressing Some of BasicSwap's Main Challenges\nAs BasicSwap is currently in its beta phase, it's natural and expected that\nusers might need to put in extra effort to get it up and running. Fixing these\nobstacles is all a part of our development roadmap, and we're actively working\nto address them through ongoing updates; our goal being to evolve BasicSwap into\na highly user-friendly and intuitive trading platform.\n\nHowever, for those eager to leverage the benefits of BasicSwap today, there are\na few challenges to navigate in the meantime.\n\nThe Need to Run and Store BasicSwap Nodes Locally \nOne of the current challenges with BasicSwap is the necessity to run the DEX\nlocally. This can be resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU usage and storage\nspace as it requires running full nodes — and storing blockchains — for each\ncryptocurrency you wish to enable and swap.\n\nWhile BasicSwap works with pruned blockchains, which considerably reduce the\nstorage footprint, the DEX still demands several gigabytes of space. And while\nthis approach offers the highest level of security and privacy, it comes with\nsignificant resource requirements that may not be feasible for everyone.\n\nAnother consideration when running a full node is the need to keep your computer\nrunning continuously if you want your offers to remain visible on the order book\nand to execute swaps. This can be inconvenient for those who aim to provide\nliquidity reliably and continuously, and makes your setup vulnerable to power\ncuts and internet downtimes. \n\nThe Need to Manually Update and Republish Offers\nWith BasicSwap's current version, offers listed on the order book are\ntime-sensitive, expiring after a maximum of 48 hours. Once an offer expires, it\nrequires you to manually republish it so that it reappears on the order book.\nThis process sure can be cumbersome, especially for those looking to passively\nprovide liquidity and with hopes of earning profits from it.\n\nAdditionally, BasicSwap does not currently have a built-in feature for\nautomatically calculating current market rates for the trading pairs you offer.\nThis means each time you refresh your offers, you need to manually determine the\nmarket rates, another potentially time-consuming task especially when working\nwith multiple pairs.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a 24/7 BasicSwap Cloud Instance\nAs we progress in our development roadmap, addressing these challenges and\nimproving the user experience to make the DEX more intuitive is a top priority.\n\nIndeed, our roadmap includes plans to enable light nodes, remote services, web\ngateways, and the integration of advanced market making strategies directly into\nthe DEX, among other items.\n\nBut in the meantime, we understand the importance of providing immediate\nsolutions to these issues. To that end, we have prepared two specific video\ntutorials that are designed to help you navigate through the aformentioned\nchallenges effectively, offering practical solutions that you can implement\nright away. \n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first step is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is\nextremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your\ncomputer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your\npersonal computer.\n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting\nthe costs via any potential trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThe second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This\nallows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated\nmanner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\nand add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential profits\nwhenever people pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node and providing liquidity to the DEX entirely effortless once the\ninitial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy the\nmarket making script, and earn arbitrage profits as people trade using your\nliquidity.\n\nWhy Providing Liquidity is Important\nBasicSwap, as an order book-based DEX, significantly differs from Automated\nMarket Maker (AMM) style exchanges. While AMM DEXs can achieve deeper liquidity\nthrough algorithmic aggregation of all provided liquidity, they face several\ncritical issues that BasicSwap effectively addresses. These include\nsusceptibility to front-running, the prevalence of rug pulls, lack of financial\nprivacy, potential slippage on large trades, and other related challenges.\n\nHowever, order book-based platforms like BasicSwap require more liquidity to\nfill various price ranges for each pair, as this liquidity isn't being\nalgorithmically driven towards a calculated market price. A lack of sufficient\nliquidity can make the exchange less appealing, leading to larger spreads and\nfewer trading opportunities. Conversely, when there's an abundance of liquidity,\norder book-based DEXs can outperform AMM platforms by offering traders more\ncontrol over the prices at which they wish to trade.\n\nIn essence, for BasicSwap and other order book-based exchanges (including most\ncentralized exchanges), liquidity is the name of the game. It's the key factor\nthat determines the platform's effectiveness and appeal. As such, we are calling\non you to contribute to BasicSwap's growth by helping to increase its liquidity. \n\nUshering a Better World for Crypto Trading\nAs liquidity on BasicSwap increases, it will improve the appeal of each trading\npair, offering traders what they need to permanently move away from centralized\nexchanges; a shift that is essential for taking back control over their own\ncoins and financial privacy.\n\nCentralized exchanges have long maintained a firm grip over the cryptocurrency\nmarket, acting as gatekeepers and creating central points of failure. This is in\ndirect contradiction to the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies. After all,\nrecent events have clearly demonstrated the severe repercussions of\nover-reliance on such centralized systems.\n\nIncidentally, this is precisely the reason behind the creation of BasicSwap DEX.\nIts non-custodial nature, commission-free model, and privacy-first approach\nrepresent the comprehensive solution needed for the crypto ecosystem to progress\nand withstand the upcoming regulatory attack against it. \n\nBy contributing liquidity to BasicSwap, you're not just participating in the\nplatform's growth; you're becoming a part of the historical movement fighting\nfor our digital sovereignty. Your involvement plays a crucial role in shaping a\nmore secure and decentralized future for cryptocurrency trading.\n\nFor this reason, we invite you to join us in this initiative today. Together, we\ncan make a significant impact, and we thank you for standing alongside with us\nin this important life mission.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

MoneroKon 2023 in Prague\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-talk-at-monerokon/], where our team from\nBasicSwap DEX was represented. Our developer, Kewde, gave an insightful\npresentation on the evolution, future, and historical context of atomic swaps,\nwith a particular focus on their application with Monero.\n\nThe presentation is available, in full, on our Youtube channel, and you can\nwatch it here.\n\nWhat we've Achieved Since the Presentation\nSince presenting in June 2023, we achieved significant milestones in our road\ntowards making the DEX more usable, accessible, and feature-complete.\n\nBidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nProbably the most significant achievement since has been the deployment of\nbidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n.\n\nAdaptor signature swaps were groundbreaking when they were first published\nbecause they enabled atomic swaps between two blockchains, even if only one had\nprogrammable outputs. \n\nThis development was a game-changer, particularly for Monero, as it allowed for\natomic swaps with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Particl, marking a\nsignificant leap forward in our collective goal of preserving our financial\nprivacy and sovereignty.\n\nHowever, these swaps had a limitation: they were unidirectional. This meant they\ncould only occur when the coin with programmable outputs (i.e., Bitcoin) was the\none being offered. In practical terms, that means Monero couldn't be the coin\noffered in the swap; it could only be received in exchange for another coin like\nBitcoin.\n\nThe introduction of bidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps by BasicSwap\nDEX is a pivotal contribution to this technology. By utilizing Particl's\nSecureMessaging Network (SMSG), we've developed a method that, from the user's\nperspective, enables the coin without scriptable outputs to be swapped from both\nthe offerer and bidder sides.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper understanding of this significant advancement\nin atomic swap technology, we highly recommend reading this blog post\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/] \non the subject or exploring our DEX Revolution series available here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n. Additionally, we've published a detailed article here\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] that compares standard HTLC\natomic swaps with adaptor signature-based atomic swaps, providing more insights\ninto the differences between these two atomic swap technologies.\n\nBetter User Interface\nBasicSwap’s GUI 2.0.2 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 2.0.2 user interface is now\navailable, featuring a wide range of improvements to the user experience and UI\ncodebase.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/]We've been\ncontinuously improving BasicSwap's user interface, and we're pleased to share\nthat a major UI/UX update (version 2.1) is on the horizon.\n\nFor those interested in what this update entails, we've provided a detailed\noverview in our weekly development progress update here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n. We encourage you to head over there to learn more about all the improvements\nand changes that will be part of this upcoming release. \n\nGraphical Installers\nBasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows Released (.exe)The installation wizard\n(.exe) for BasicSwap DEX is now available for Windows users.Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-installer-for-windows-released-exe/]We've\nrecently released a graphical installation wizard for Windows users (.exe) for\nthose looking for an easier approach to setting everything up. This new feature\nnot only simplifies the installation process for Windows users but has also\ndriven a series of back-end improvements.\n\nCurrently, the installation wizard is exclusive to Windows, but we're actively\nworking on extending it to MacOS and Linux users. We aim for a release on these\noperating systems shortly, stay tuned for more any news in that regard published\non Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\nWhat's on the Horizon\nWhile 2023 was focused a lot on the DEX's back-end and developing some of its\ncore features, 2024 is poised to be a pivotal year for BasicSwap as we will\nrelease some of its most significant updates in terms of usability and\naccessibility.\n\nHere are just a few main items we plan on working on. Note that this isn't a\nfully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well,\nespecially back-end improvements and new functionalities.\n\nLight Nodes / Remote Services\nThis improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place,\nit eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which\ncurrently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup\ntimes. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX,\npotentially by more than 90%.\n\nCurrently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive\nprocess and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements.\nHowever, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level\nof security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and\nremote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands,\nthey will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize\nmaximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who\nprefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking\nfor.\n\nWeb Framework\nAs an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a\nweb framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services\ndirectly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even\n\"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.\n\nHowever, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that\nhosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore,\nsimilar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based\nversion of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a\nweb-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional\noptions, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to\nattracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's\norder book which is critical to its success.\n\nThe exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and\nthe specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet\ncommit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular\nupdates on this development in our weekly progress reports here\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/].\n\nMore Coins\nWe are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in\nprivacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize\nthe importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To\nthis end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and\nits various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.\n\nAgain, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it\ndirectly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This,\nin turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and\npractical for trading purposes.\n\nSince our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on\nessential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new\ncoins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of\nnew coins and tokens to the DEX.\n\nWe're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build\nmore bridges between communities! ?\n\nTaproot Integration\nBecause Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the\nSchnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot\nupdate which will bring massive privacy benefits.\n\nWhile our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the\nblocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature\ntransaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for\nexample, Bitcoin in a BTC <> XMR swap). It's important to note that this does\nnot disclose any information about the swap to outside observers.

Note that this isn't a fully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well, especially back-end improvements and new functionalities.</p><h3 id=\"light-nodes-remote-services\">Light Nodes / Remote Services</h3><p>This improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place, it eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which currently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup times. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX, potentially by more than 90%.</p><p>Currently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive process and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements. However, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level of security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and remote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands, they will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize maximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who prefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking for.</p><h3 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h3><p>As an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a web framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services directly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even \"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.</p><p>However, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that hosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore, similar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based version of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a web-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional options, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to attracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's order book which is critical to its success.</p><p>The exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and the specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet commit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular updates on this development in our weekly progress reports <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"more-coins\">More Coins</h3><p>We are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in privacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize the importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To this end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and its various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.</p><p>Again, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it directly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This, in turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and practical for trading purposes.</p><p>Since our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on essential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new coins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of new coins and tokens to the DEX.</p><p>We're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build more bridges between communities! ?</p><h3 id=\"taproot-integration\">Taproot Integration</h3><p>Because Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the Schnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot update which will bring massive privacy benefits.</p><p>While our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the blocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature transaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for example, Bitcoin in a BTC &lt;&gt; XMR swap). It's important to note that this does not disclose any information about the swap to outside observers.

series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n, we touched on the progressive evolution of atomic swap technology, bringing us\nall the way to a comprehensive atomic swap-based DEX framework that is able to\nsupport coins with no scripting language support, such as Part(Anon) and XMR.\nThis, of course, plays towards our eventual goal to integrate the BasicSwap\nprotocol into other access gateways, most notably a web-based DEX and a\nseamlessly integrated Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] \nintegration, in an ongoing effort to bring truly decentralized, private\ne-commerce to the widest audience possible.\n\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol already boasts a wide array of different coins,\neach with their own advantages and communities, two big pieces are still being\nconsidered for integration into BSX: stablecoins, and the extremely popular\nEthereum ecosystem. Of course, being able to integrate the latter would\nimmediately make the integration of a number of stablecoins trivial, as many\nstablecoins already exist as ETH tokens.\n\nThese are some thoughts on what a PART(Anon)-ETH and XMR-ETH swap integration\ninto a comprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap could look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Existing XMR-ETH Swap\n\nPeople who had the pleasure to witness Elizabeth Bink [https://github.com/noot]\n’s Monerotopia presentation on XMR-ETH swaps may have developed a curiosity\ntowards hyper-private Ethereum swaps and what they entail, perhaps most\nimportantly in the hopes of facilitating untraceable, decentralized swaps\nbetween privacy coins and stablecoins (or simply ETH itself).\n\nElizabeth and the open source project AthanorLabs\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] achieved the first XMR-ETH atomic\nswap earlier this year, and presented it to the world at the Monerotopia\nconference in Mexico City, on May 6th. Using their own breakthrough protocol,\nAthanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring\nto the table, to achieve for the first time a bona fide atomic swap between the\ntwo currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations\nto integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap\nworks and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly\nmore interesting for our purposes.\n\nUnder The Hood\nXMR, of course, and as we’ve discussed at length\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic HTLC swap\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], where both coins need some\nbasic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.\n\nETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people\nfamiliar with the semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4] \nthat the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that\nthe “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nAs it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless\nadaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of\ntoday fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is\nthat Ethereum is account-based\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/], and not UTXO-based.\n\nThe Challenges of an Account-based Architecture\nIn short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to\ndecrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account\nbalance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based\ntransaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique nonce\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp]. To that end, the nonce is\npublicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that\nthe same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.\n\nThis breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires\nrefund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a\ntransaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could\nthen send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and\nwhen the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed\ntransaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).\n\nPre-signing in adaptor signature swapsAthanorLab's solution is to make use of\nEthereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the\nswap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless\n- but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the\nnecessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by\nthe powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC\n(where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than\nadaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the\nside without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other\ntransaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the\ntransaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even\nwith sophisticated chain analysis tools.\n\nSo, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal\nlogic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds —\nincluding Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both\ninadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a\nfull integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.\n\nA snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG networkCurrent\nProtocol Limitations\nAn important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is\nthat ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in.\nThat means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only\none side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. \n\nThe RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund\nin case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks\nfirst, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder\nlocks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked\nforever. This means that the swap itself always has to be structured in one way,\nwith XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at\nthe protocol level.\n\nAnother underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even\nadvertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the\nEthereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided\nfor by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another\nreason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder\nto lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could\neasily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or\nmultiple offers, and back out.\n\nThis unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's\nparameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective\nquantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have\nlittle say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the\npreferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. \n\nAthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interfaceLooking Ahead\nMuch like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, BasicSwap's intention is to leverage\nthe SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed\nXMR-ETH swap protocol.\n\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nRemember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps\ndidn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic\nswap protocol.

That means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only one side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. </p><p>The RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund in case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks first, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder locks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked forever. This means that <strong>the swap itself always has to be structured in one way</strong>, with XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at the protocol level.</p><p>Another underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even advertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the Ethereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided for by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another reason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder to lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could easily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or multiple offers, and back out.</p><p>This unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have little say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the preferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-9.png 600w, /glink/2023/08/image-9.png 981w\"><figcaption><em>AthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interface</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking Ahead</h2><p>Much like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, <strong>BasicSwap's intention is to leverage the SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed XMR-ETH swap protocol</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Cangrejo</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/18420229ea02ad69f34759df50d149e3/bidireciton_medium.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>Remember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps didn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol.

in May 2023, we traveled to Mexico City as the BasicSwap team to attend\nMonerotopia 2023. For this edition of the Monero-centric conference, they've\ndecided to welcome various privacy-focused cryptocurrency and blockchain\nprojects. There, we not only hosted a booth and forged valuable connections, but\nalso presented, on the event's main stage, BasicSwap DEX, its mission, story,\nand role within the broader privacy subset of the cryptocurrency economy.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce that the presentation is now officially\navailable on MoneroTalk's Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/@MoneroTalk/videos], and that you can finally watch it\nfrom home!\n\nTry BasicSwap DEX Today\nBasicSwap DEX's open beta is live and you can use it today! All you need to do\nis follow the instructions either on its section of the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html]\n, or from the Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEZ-a00uSM&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfxAswJnqlh_KbHvWCUFqFVF]\n.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's Order BookWhat Happened Since This Presentation\nSince this presentation, we've been hard at work improving BasicSwap's core tech\nand elevating its user experience. \n\nFirstly, we've introduced a basic liquidity providing / market making tool\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/] that anyone can deploy and\noperate from home. While it falls short of any advanced feature, such as what\nwould be possible via something like a Hummingbot integration, it enables more\nautomated and logic-based management of your liquidity and offers. Of course, we\nplan on much more all-emcompassing solutions moving forward; this is merely the\nfirst initial step towards more comprehensive solutions in the future.\n\nWe've also pursued our work on implementing a series of user interface\nimprovements [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/],\nsimplifying and refining the end-user experience. These updates have also\nsignificantly streamlined the code, enhancing the app's efficiency.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most notably since the Monerotopia presentation, we've\nadded the long-awaited bidirectional atomic swap functionality for Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. As explained in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, Monero atomic swaps, despite their groundbreaking nature, were previously\nlimited by a significant technical constraint: offers could only request Monero,\nnot offer it for other cryptocurrencies, leading to a 'one-way swapping only'\nscenario.\n\nOur latest update addresses this limitation, enabling 'two-way' Monero swapping \nor, in other words, allowing you to offer Monero when creating swap offers on\nBasicSwap's order book. While this clever workaround, made possible by the SMSG\nnetwork, doesn't resolve the technical limitation at the protocol level, it does\nso at the end-user level, making the user experience seamless with no additional\nsteps, fees, or encumbrances.\n\nThis development positions atomic swap-based Monero DEXs like BasicSwap as a\nviable alternative to data-hungry and oftentimes straight up irresponsible\ncentralized exchanges. It significantly enhances the resilience of Monero and\nPART (Anon) to external attacks and censorship campaigns.\n\nWhat's Next for BasicSwap DEX? \nWith the successful launch of the major bidirectional Monero atomic swap update,\nour attention, in regards to BasicSwap, is now concentrated on three key areas.\n\nFirstly, we are actively exploring the addition of more cryptocurrencies to the\nplatform. Though we've had to postpone this expansion to prioritize core aspects\nof the DEX, the demand for new additions has remained strong, with many requests\noriginating directly from representatives of projects seeking to be included on\nour platform. Therefore, we are now assessing the integration feasibility of\nseveral coins and hope to add a few of them in the coming weeks, alongside our\nongoing work on other areas.\n\nSecondly, we are in the process of developing a web framework that will enable\nBasicSwap-powered web services to be easily accessed through a web browser. For\nexample, envision web-based exchanges akin to Changelly or ChangeNow, but driven\nby a completely decentralized exchange protocol (BasicSwap). This significant\nadvancement is crucial in making BasicSwap DEX accessible to the wider crypto\ncommunity, including those with less technical expertise. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of this web framework will allow integrations with various\napplications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr.\nKap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl\nMarketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during\ncheckout, while still settling the transaction in PART. This is but one example\nof what can be possible with a web framework built for integrations.\n\nLastly, we are committed to enhancing BasicSwap's scalability. We are\nconsidering two potential solutions for this. The first involves creating what\nwe have temporarily named \"SMSG 2.0\". Although referred to as 2.0, this\ninitiative actually requires constructing a new SMSG-like mixnet from the ground\nup, designed for near-infinite scalability. Though we have a design and some\ninitial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand\nsignificant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative\nmixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of\nincorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap. Depending on the daily\nusage of BasicSwap, a balancing system could distribute the messaging load\nacross all integrated mixnets, thus ensuring the DEX's scalability for early but\nsubstantial adoption.\n\nAnd while we believe strongly in the scalability potential of SMSG 2.0, the\nsystem balancing messaging load across multiple mixnets might remain even after\nits readiness, if it proves effective, as it may further bolster the resiliency\nand decentralization of the DEX.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOf course, the elements we are currently focusing on, including the integration\nof more complex cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap, are substantial and will\nrequire time to fully develop. However, these efforts are paramount to realizing\nour vision of a seamlessly interconnected, privacy-first, and pro-liberty\ndigital economy. Equally important is making this economy as accessible as\npossible, to ensure that it can be embraced by a wide audience.\n\nOnce implemented, these three significant advancements will position BasicSwap\nDEX to challenge traditional centralized exchanges and catalyze the broader\nadoption of a crypto economy that's truly independent of the legacy \"fiat\nsystem\".\n\nIn the interim, we invite you to support BasicSwap by testing its capabilities,\nsharing feedback and comments with us, and adding liquidity to the order book.\nEvery contribution, regardless of its size, plays a vital role in building the\nbrighter future we all strive to achieve.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This significant advancement is crucial in making BasicSwap DEX accessible to the wider crypto community, including those with less technical expertise. Moreover, the development of this web framework will allow integrations with various applications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr. Kap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl Marketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during checkout, while still settling the transaction in PART.

Though we have a design and some initial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand significant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative mixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of incorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap.

This is\ndue to certain technological constraints behind the semi-scriptless adaptor\nsignature scheme that is required for XMR swaps.\n\nToday, we’re extremely proud to announce the implementation of bi-directional\nMonero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps on BasicSwap DEX, meaning swaps can now be\nfacilitated in both directions.\n\nIn this blog post, we will delve deeper into the significance of this\nachievement, the methodology used to accomplish it, and its impact on the\npreservation of our privacy and liberties moving forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * Why are Bidirectional Swaps Significant?\n * Brief History of Monero Atomic Swaps\n * The Big Caveat with PART(Anon) and XMR Atomic Swaps\n * Bidirectional PART(Anon) and XMR Swaps Are Here!\n * How was it Accomplished?\n * Leveraging the SMSG Network\n * Simulating Offers Requesting Part (Anon) and XMR\n * Technical Documentation\n * How to Use\n * What Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\n * Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\n * The Road Ahead\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy are Bidirectional Swaps Significant?\nTo fully comprehend the significance of bidirectional adaptor signature atomic\nswaps, it's essential to first explore the historical development and\nfunctionality of conventional, unidirectional semi-scriptless swaps.\n\nBrief History of Monero Atomic Swaps\nAs we outlined in a recent blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, atomic swaps have long-been available to the general public ever since the\nadvent of basic HTLC-based atomic swaps, a technology that was first\nimplemented\nby the Decred team [https://github.com/decred/atomicswap].\n\nSimplied flow chart for an HTLC atomic swapHTLC swaps permit the free and\ntrustless exchange of digital assets between two parties. However, they\nnecessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have\nprogrammable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for\na wide array of coins, but not for Monero.\n\nAs the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important\nfor BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of\nfinancial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital\ncash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom\nactors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.\n\nThat’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed a\nnew Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf]. This breakthrough development, a\nproduct of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years,\nfinally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without\nthe need for programmable outputs.\n\n> Note: For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our\nrecent blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n.\nThe Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps\nWhile the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a\nsignificant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only\noperate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an\natomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer'\nand a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).\n\nThe offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap\nrequest, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder,\nin contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon\nagreement, initiates the swap process.\n\nThe offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested\ncoins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other\nparameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are\nnot specifically pertinent to this article's context.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's order bookDue to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless\natomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more\naccurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This\nstipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable\noutputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being\noffered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.\n\nTo better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which\ndescribes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from\nthe perspective of the 'offerer'.\n\nSee flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\nNote that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin —\na Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the\nMonero user could then accept and initiate a swap.

Now, in contrast to the previous setup where Monero could only be\nchosen as the requested coin, you also have the option to offer it when placing\na new offer on the order book.\n\nThere are no extra steps or additional prerequisites involved. However, remember\nthat this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with\nsome additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're\nrequesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just\nlike any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. \n\nTo benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure\nthat your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version. To\ninstall it, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image.\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command.\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build command.\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nIf you're not using the Docker setup, you can follow the Particl Academy's\nstep-by-step update guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nWhat Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\nThe introduction of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps for all symbolizes a\nmonumental step towards establishing a privacy-first, resilient global economy\nthat is fair to all.\n\nIndeed, we've observed a steady increase in aggressive, restrictive measures\ntargeting privacy coins like Particl and Monero in recent years, a trend that\nhas only accelerated in recent weeks. As evidenced by the removal of the\ncryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the\naccessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals\nworldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are\nbeing enforced is only likely to speed up over time.\n\nFurthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial\ncryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or,\nat the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the\nworld, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as\nBasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that\ncryptocurrencies like Monero and truly decentralized and self-custodial\nsolutions like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various\nglobal regulations, are needed.\n\nDecentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\nFortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate\nentirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed\nand serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's\nwidespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its\nsurvival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.\n\nHowever, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing\nchallenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has\nresulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular\ncryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor\nsignature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to\nexecute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant\nbarrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.\n\nThe integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX\nmarks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance\nof today's announcement.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nOf course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance,\nBasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains\nrelatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process\nwith the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher,\nthe resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized\nexchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.\n\nThis fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that\nwill equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading\nplatforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness\nBasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without\nhaving to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web\nwallets.\n\nWhile this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of\nbidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for\nthe development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime\nfocus moving forward.\n\nWe encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at Particl News\n[https://particl.news] for updates on this topic.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness BasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without having to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web wallets.</p><p>While this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for the development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime focus moving forward.</p><p>We encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a></strong> for updates on this topic.

However, they necessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have programmable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for a wide array of coins, but not for Monero.</p><p>As the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important for BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of financial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital cash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom actors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.</p><p>That’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed <strong><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf\">a new Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures</a></strong>. This breakthrough development, a product of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years, finally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without the need for programmable outputs.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our recent blog post on the topic <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">here</a></strong>.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-big-caveat-to-monero-atomic-swaps\">The Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2><p>While the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a significant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only operate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This stipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable outputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being offered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.</p><p>To better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which describes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from the perspective of the 'offerer'.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-4.png 1264w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Note that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin — a Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the Monero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

Now, in contrast to the previous setup where Monero could only be chosen as the requested coin, you also have the option to offer it when placing a new offer on the order book.</p><p>There are no extra steps or additional prerequisites involved. However, remember that this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with some additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're requesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just like any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. </p><p>To benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure that your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness BasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without having to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web wallets.</p><p>While this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for the development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime focus moving forward.</p><p>We encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a></strong> for updates on this topic.

Furthermore, simply\naccessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and\nattention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for\nmany.\n\nThankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably a more\nstraightforward and less complicated install process\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-] \n— are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but\nparticularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on\nthe BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the\nBasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror\nto the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users\nto connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light\nservices or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have\nto pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third\nparties involved at any point.\n\nIn addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap\napplication already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important\nfeature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of\nadditional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current\ndevelopment focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized HTLC and Adaptor Sig\nswaps [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] available on the BSX\nnetwork. \n\nThe goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a\nplug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps,\nwhich addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on\nthe other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience\nthat characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.\n\nOur Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways\n\nTo honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap\nprotocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.\n\nFirst of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with\nregards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some\nof the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must\nkeep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from\nthe convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general\ntransparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses,\nsmart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and\npeer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.\n\nA second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based\nBasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web\nusers to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order\nbook, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private\norder books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end,\ninvesting development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and\nincentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be\ninstrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based\nDEX.\n\nThirdly, continuing our commitment to modular software architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] will ensure the\nexceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform\nvia the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG\nnetwork (1\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/])\nin the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high\nexpectations of BasicSwap DEX. This design philosophy also makes the platform\nmore scalable, both at the gateway level and at the protocol level.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeveloping the Economy of Tomorrow\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol itself is still in beta and that many of the\nnecessary building blocks towards a smooth, user-friendly atomic swap web DEX\nare still in the works, behind-the-scenes development of BasicSwap is going\nsplendidly, and a working beta of such a revolutionary web-based exchange\nplatform is well in progress.
