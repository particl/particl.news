While Particl wasn’t listed in their research [lame], this\nlogic is embedded in our vision:\n\n> … to foster a fully independent, decentralized economy and provide a sustainable\nenvironment of collaboration and innovation that empowers peers across different\nblockchain projects while respecting their rights to freedom and privacy.\nIt’s a mouthful, but key words in it —decentralized, economy, collaboration,\nfreedom, privacy— affect every decision the team has made since day one and\nevery decision going forward.\n\nFirst Days\nToken exchange\nPrior to going live in July we held a successful token exchange\n[https://particl.news/particl-successfully-closes-out-its-seed-funding-round-highlighted-by-1658-participants-5-1-38dee90d1a91] \n(March/April 2017). Dwarfed by funding raised by ICO projects and supported by\nour generous contributors, we reached all three milestones and our goal of\n$750,000 to support a focus team for 10 months for the development of Particl\nCore and the Particl Marketplace MVP.\n\nWhitepaper\nDeveloper Ido Kaiser presented the first draft of our marketplace in March 2017. \nhttps://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\n\nParticl Foundation\nA crucial step prior to launching the PART blockchain was to create the Particl\nFoundation [https://particl.news/particl-foundation-is-approved-6cad0343e04f]. A \nnon-profit\n[https://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/company/particl-stiftung-7829033751/detail] \nlocated in Zug, Switzerland, the Foundation controls all the donations received\nin the token exchange and financially supports the development of Particl.\n\n> The foundation and its board will strictly function as an entity with the\nmission of providing funding and support for the Particl ecosystem, the\ncontinued development of the Particl network and academic, non-profit &\nfor-profit development of enhancements for the Particl platform and privacy\ndomain. The foundation will not govern nor make choices for the network itself,\nas the network will be governed in a decentralized manner by the native voting\nsystem directed by the network token holders themselves\nCurrency\nWhen Particl launched the PART token in July it was the only coin besides BTC\nand LTC running the latest secure code (0.14.2 at the time) and the first coin\nwith native SegWit (all transactions on Particl use segregated witness).\n\nOn top of Bitcoin, PART was also the first/only coin with Confidential\nTransactions (CT) privately blinding transactions amounts (breaking\ntraceability), and was the first/only coin with Ring Confidential Transactions\n(RingCT) allowing truly private transactions that privately obfuscate both\namounts and addresses (breaking traceability and linkability).\n\n> \nThe Particl development team launched PART with these “first in the industry”\nfeatures, day one… you’re welcome!\n\n> \nTo stop at the private, PART cryptocurrency was never in the cards for the team\nor our supportive community. The beginnings of an economy built on the\ndecentralized network effects of blockchain starts with a currency but in no way\nends there.\n\nFirst Steps\nSecurity\nThere is a responsibility put on a foundation/project to protect its userbase\nwith the latest security research/development offers. Rule 1: maintain the\ncodebase. Your codebase is your infrastructure, and in economics spending\ntime/money on infrastructure paves the way for growth and prosperity.\n\nThis year Bitcoin has updated its codebase 3\n[https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history] times since the launch of Particl. Our\nteam has merged those changes each time at a speed unmatched in the industry.\n\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.1 (17.11.11)| Particl Core 0.15.1 (6 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 (17.09.19)| Particl Core 0.15.0.2 (10 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 (17.09.14) | Merged with above (15 days later)\n\nTo put this in perspective with other top cryptocurrency projects with Bitcoin\nas their codebase:\n\nPlease let me know if these codebase releases aren’t correct, I’ll fix np.It’s\nworth noting even straight forks of the Bitcoin blockchain this year aren’t\nbeing responsible to stay up-dated after the ceremony of splitting, gifting “\nfree [http://www.btcd.io/index.html#/]” coins to historical BTC addresses and\ninstant piggybacking on existing services\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/coinbase-adds-bitcoin-cash-offering-momentum-to-bitcoin-rival]\n.\n\nThe importance of fixing security breaches should be self evident in our\ntechnology dominated lives…\n\nThe above video is from the #BreakingBitcoin conference this year and this was\nthe controversial presentation given by Chris Jeffrey\n[https://twitter.com/_chjj] exposing a big permissions bug that was later fixed\nin Bitcoin 0.15 [https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0]. All project codebases\nolder than protocol 0.15 are vulnerable to this bug and the farther away from\nthe latest code a project is the potentially harder it is to make fixes and\nprotect its users.\n\nTestnet\nThe moxie of a project can be gauged by their development community and testing\nenvironment. Before going live in July we opened up our open source code to\ntesters and developers in June\n[https://particl.news/particl-testnet2-is-now-live-e14b12301a14]. Thank you to\nall the people that helped prepare for our genesis block and successful launch!\n\nTwo of our most important developments started on testnet this year: RingCT and\nCold Staking (conditional staking). Cold Staking has since moved onto mainnet\nwhile RingCT is being reviewed with the help from researchers\n[http://cs.njit.edu/people/qiang-tang] at New Jersey Institute of Technology.\n\nThere’s no reason for Particl to not stay lock-n-step with Bitcoin researchers\nand developers throughout 2018 and beyond, and PART users should expect nothing\nless. Our privacy like CT & RingCT are enhancements to current protocol; making\nBitcoin private… no matter what project forks BTC blockchain next year making\nthe same claims ?\n\nLearning to Run\nWallets\nWith creating a top-tier privacy cryptocurrency in the books, our focus shifted\nto our other 2017 roadmap items that included tools to make PART use more mobile\nand user friendly.

While Particl wasn’t listed in their research [lame], this logic is embedded in our vision:</p><blockquote>… to foster a fully independent, decentralized economy and provide a sustainable environment of collaboration and innovation that empowers peers across different blockchain projects while respecting their rights to freedom and privacy.</blockquote><p>It’s a mouthful, but key words in it —<em> decentralized, economy, collaboration, freedom, privacy</em> — affect every decision the team has made since day one and every decision going forward.</p><h2 id=\"first-days\">First Days</h2><h3 id=\"token-exchange\">Token exchange</h3><p>Prior to going live in July we held a successful <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-successfully-closes-out-its-seed-funding-round-highlighted-by-1658-participants-5-1-38dee90d1a91\">token exchange</a> (March/April 2017).

A <a href=\"https://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/company/particl-stiftung-7829033751/detail\">non-profit</a> located in Zug, Switzerland, the Foundation controls all the donations received in the token exchange and financially supports the development of Particl.</p><blockquote>The foundation and its board will strictly function as an entity with the mission of providing funding and support for the Particl ecosystem, the continued development of the Particl network and academic, non-profit &amp; for-profit development of enhancements for the Particl platform and privacy domain. The foundation will not govern nor make choices for the network itself, as the network will be governed in a decentralized manner by the native voting system directed by the network token holders themselves</blockquote><h3 id=\"currency\">Currency</h3><p>When Particl launched the PART token in July it was the only coin besides BTC and LTC running the latest secure code (0.14.2 at the time) and the first coin with <strong>native</strong> SegWit (all transactions on Particl use segregated witness).</p><p>On top of Bitcoin, PART was also the first/only coin with Confidential Transactions (CT) privately blinding transactions amounts (breaking traceability), and was the first/only coin with Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) allowing truly private transactions that privately obfuscate both amounts and addresses (breaking traceability <strong>and</strong> linkability).</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>The Particl development team <strong>launched</strong> PART with these “first in the industry” features, day one… you’re welcome!</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>To stop at the private, PART cryptocurrency was never in the cards for the team or our supportive community.

While Particl wasn’t listed in their research [lame], this logic is embedded in our vision:</p><blockquote>… to foster a fully independent, decentralized economy and provide a sustainable environment of collaboration and innovation that empowers peers across different blockchain projects while respecting their rights to freedom and privacy.</blockquote><p>It’s a mouthful, but key words in it —<em> decentralized, economy, collaboration, freedom, privacy</em> — affect every decision the team has made since day one and every decision going forward.</p><h2 id=\"first-days\">First Days</h2><h3 id=\"token-exchange\">Token exchange</h3><p>Prior to going live in July we held a successful <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-successfully-closes-out-its-seed-funding-round-highlighted-by-1658-participants-5-1-38dee90d1a91\">token exchange</a> (March/April 2017). Dwarfed by funding raised by ICO projects and supported by our generous contributors, we reached all three milestones and our goal of $750,000 to support a focus team for 10 months for the development of Particl Core and the Particl Marketplace MVP.</p><h3 id=\"whitepaper\">Whitepaper</h3><p>Developer Ido Kaiser presented the first draft of our marketplace in March 2017. <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf</a></p><h3 id=\"particl-foundation\">Particl Foundation</h3><p>A crucial step prior to launching the PART blockchain was to create the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-foundation-is-approved-6cad0343e04f\">Particl Foundation</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/company/particl-stiftung-7829033751/detail\">non-profit</a> located in Zug, Switzerland, the Foundation controls all the donations received in the token exchange and financially supports the development of Particl.</p><blockquote>The foundation and its board will strictly function as an entity with the mission of providing funding and support for the Particl ecosystem, the continued development of the Particl network and academic, non-profit &#x26; for-profit development of enhancements for the Particl platform and privacy domain. The foundation will not govern nor make choices for the network itself, as the network will be governed in a decentralized manner by the native voting system directed by the network token holders themselves</blockquote><h3 id=\"currency\">Currency</h3><p>When Particl launched the PART token in July it was the only coin besides BTC and LTC running the latest secure code (0.14.2 at the time) and the first coin with <strong>native</strong> SegWit (all transactions on Particl use segregated witness).</p><p>On top of Bitcoin, PART was also the first/only coin with Confidential Transactions (CT) privately blinding transactions amounts (breaking traceability), and was the first/only coin with Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) allowing truly private transactions that privately obfuscate both amounts and addresses (breaking traceability <strong>and</strong> linkability).</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>The Particl development team <strong>launched</strong> PART with these “first in the industry” features, day one… you’re welcome!</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>To stop at the private, PART cryptocurrency was never in the cards for the team or our supportive community. The beginnings of an economy built on the decentralized network effects of blockchain starts with a currency but in no way ends there.</p><h2 id=\"first-steps\">First Steps</h2><h3 id=\"security\">Security</h3><p>There is a responsibility put on a foundation/project to protect its userbase with the latest security research/development offers. Rule 1: maintain the codebase. Your codebase is your infrastructure, and in economics spending time/money on infrastructure paves the way for growth and prosperity.</p><p>This year Bitcoin has updated its codebase <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history\">3</a> times since the launch of Particl. Our team has merged those changes each time at a speed unmatched in the industry.</p><ul><li>Bitcoin Core 0.15.1 (17.11.11)| Particl Core 0.15.1 (6 days later)</li><li>Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 (17.09.19)| Particl Core 0.15.0.2 (10 days later)</li><li>Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 (17.09.14) | Merged with above (15 days later)</li></ul><p>To put this in perspective with other top cryptocurrency projects with Bitcoin as their codebase:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1-q-tLM7P9Vl7RU0bMch9i9Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Please let me know if these codebase releases aren’t correct, I’ll fix np.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth noting even straight forks of the Bitcoin blockchain this year aren’t being responsible to stay up-dated after the ceremony of splitting, gifting “<a href=\"http://www.btcd.io/index.html#/\">free</a>” coins to historical BTC addresses and instant piggybacking on existing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/coinbase-adds-bitcoin-cash-offering-momentum-to-bitcoin-rival\">services</a>.</p><p>The importance of fixing security breaches should be self evident in our technology dominated lives…</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0WCaoGiAOHE?start=8940\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The above video is from the #BreakingBitcoin conference this year and this was the controversial presentation given by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_chjj\">Chris Jeffrey</a> exposing a big permissions bug that was later fixed in Bitcoin <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0\">0.15</a>. All project codebases older than protocol 0.15 are vulnerable to this bug and the farther away from the latest code a project is the potentially harder it is to make fixes and protect its users.</p><h3 id=\"testnet\">Testnet</h3><p>The moxie of a project can be gauged by their development community and testing environment. Before going live in July we opened up our open source code to testers and developers in <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-testnet2-is-now-live-e14b12301a14\">June</a>. Thank you to all the people that helped prepare for our genesis block and successful launch!</p><p>Two of our most important developments started on testnet this year: RingCT and Cold Staking (conditional staking). Cold Staking has since moved onto mainnet while RingCT is being reviewed with the help from <a href=\"http://cs.njit.edu/people/qiang-tang\">researchers</a> at New Jersey Institute of Technology.</p><p>There’s no reason for Particl to not stay lock-n-step with Bitcoin researchers and developers throughout 2018 and beyond, and PART users should expect nothing less. Our privacy like CT &#x26; RingCT are enhancements to current protocol; making Bitcoin private… no matter what project forks BTC blockchain next year making the same claims ?</p><h2 id=\"learning-to-run\">Learning to Run</h2><h3 id=\"wallets\">Wallets</h3><p>With creating a top-tier privacy cryptocurrency in the books, our focus shifted to our other 2017 roadmap items that included tools to make PART use more mobile and user friendly. We built <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/particl-clients\">4</a> wallets this year for Particl users, specifically our Copay Wallet and our Electron Particl Wallet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1-KGb2r2jNP9h1YKrKQoq6aA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>https://github.com/particl/copay/releases/tag/v3.7.1.2</figcaption></figure><p>The Particl team was the first crypto project this year to offer a Copay Wallet based off the open source, HD‑multisignature wallet from <a href=\"https://copay.io/\">BitPay</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay\">wallet</a> is like a swiss-army knife for PART with the ability to have multiple wallets, shared wallets, multi-signature addresses and more.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1-LuM8x_iY8qAEiI1wM-MIog.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>https://github.com/particl/partgui/releases/tag/v1.0.0</figcaption></figure><p>Our <a href=\"https://electronjs.org/apps/particl\">Electron</a> Particl Wallet is a first-of-its-kind wallet in the cryptocurrency space. Opting for a better user experience and greater security, we moved away from the classic Bitcoin “Qt” wallet, instead building a full-blown WebEngine.</p><p>This approach allowed us to create a beautiful interface and a standardized API to build extensions upon. The team is using <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> as the main framework.</p><h3 id=\"utility\">Utility</h3><blockquote>“You’re supposed to use these coins to consume services like identity lookups or decentralized DNS lookups but there is no platform to use these coins yet,” —<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/mastering-shitcoins-the-poor-mans-guide-to-getting-crypto-rich-2e469b762ba9\"> Daniel Jeffries</a></blockquote><p>Mr. Jeffries rightfully identifies one of the pitfalls of crypto coins (currency) or in this case utility coins. 90% of crypto in the space this year are currency only coins that have no intrinsic value and are only as meaningful as the person buying on the other end.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1-XuP4Pmg2LlKpKKziL34e4g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Again, circling back to Particl’s vision of building a decentralized economy, every decision we make is informed by this vision. Creating the currency was step 1, creating a marketplace for people with cryptocurrency to be spent helps form an economy. A cycle of spending and earning provides utility on the blockchain.</p><p><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> is scheduled for <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\">alpha</a> release in Q1 of 2018.

One of the pieces he shared was the development of our OMP specification for the platform.</p><p>The intent of this specification is to create a standardized and open format that can encompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace. It is a good reference for the functions the team is building into Particl Marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"stacking-on-muscle\">Stacking on Muscle</h2><p>Ok, in this review I’m about 3 months into our 6 months of being live on the blockchain. There’s <strong>no way</strong> we could do so much this year, <strong>so fast</strong>, without our amazing global team!</p><h3 id=\"growth\">Growth</h3><p>At this time we’re approaching 20 people on the Particl Team. All team members are paid and 18 are full-time. The development team makes up the largest group with 14 full-time developers, 1 part-time developer.</p><p>Currently, the team is optimally loaded more on the development side to deliver the Particl Marketplace MVP as promised, Q1 2018. The marketing and communications team will be growing next to start 2018 as a big push for community growth, awareness and adoption across the cryptocurrency landscape is priority #1 ahead of the markeplace release.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-cold-staking\">Hardfork / Cold Staking</h3><p>Particl had our first hardfork <a href=\"https://particl.news/alert-particl-hardfork-nov-10th-4ca5b994017c\">Nov.10th</a>, 2017. A planned hardfork to activate Cold Staking, the community came through with spreading the word through creative graphics and viral tweets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1-9HVw7XGrsEgVN-wm5iI-aA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1--eGBziBIVasyIfixUH9BZw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1-DZxiC6SwrNAbQeOSdm1HZQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>❤️</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"atomic-swaps\">Atomic Swaps</h3><p>In October, 2017 the Particl and Decred teams <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/29#event-1308087082\">completed</a> cross-chain atomic swaps between both chains.

It is very important to follow the instructions in the box that says, \n“Please keep this wallet online until the cold staking activation process is\ncomplete.”\n\nKeep in mind, it may take several weeks to finish the activation process. With\neach stake the percentage increases towards 100%.\n\nSummary\nThis guide is now complete. Here is a list of accomplishments you have achieved\nby reaching the end.\n\n * Created a Staking Node wallet\n * Created a Staking Node Public Key\n * Linked a Staking Node wallet with 0 PART to a 2nd wallet on another computer\n   that has the PART you want to stake.\n * Unlocked wallet with PART tokens for staking only\n * Enabled the Cold Staking Activation Process\n\nOnce you’ve reached 100% complete on the Cold Staking progress bar your two\nwallets are linked. The staking node wallet needs to be online 24/7 to receive\nstaking rewards.

In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public. While you share\nyour Particl address with others so that they can send you coins, your Particl\naddress is only a hash of your public key, not the public key itself.\n\n> A hash function is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and\nturns it into a cryptographic output. By one-way I mean that you can’t derive\nthe input from the output. It’s kind of like encrypting something then losing\nthe key.\nWhat does that mean in English?\nAll of that is a complicated way of saying that while an attacker with a quantum\ncomputer could derive the private key from the public key, they couldn’t derive\nthe public key from the Particl address since the public key was run through\nmultiple quantum-resistant one-way hash functions.\n\n— Classic!So how does this all fit together?\nThe cold staking feature consists of several key components:\n\n * your “staking node” (running a new wallet)\n * your “wallet” with your coins (much like today) and\n * a “cold staking script” — this is like the script in bitcoin or smart\n   contracts on other alts\n\nOnce activated your staking node signs transactions with its private key, thus\nyour real public key for your actual PART tokens is never exposed onto the\nblockchain, until you actually spend them, in which case the change always goes\ninto a new address where the public key is not known.\n\nCold Staking In Action\nAgain, cold staking consists of the following components — your staking node,\nyour wallet and a cold staking script.\n\nWhat is the cold staking script?\n\nIt is essentially a smart contract that says `if this is a cold staking\ntransaction, then allow the private key from the staking node to sign the\ntransaction; otherwise the private key from the wallet is required.`\n\nLet’s walk through the process of setting cold staking up\n1First step is to setup a new “staking node”. A staking node is a full\nblockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet”\n(aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a\ndedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.\n\n> It is important to note that CPU does matter when staking, so do not expect to\nget the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.\nOnce the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then\ngenerate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in\nthe next step).\n\n**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will\nbe made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is\ndeemed secure.**\n\n2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold\nStaking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1).\nEnter this and click activate.\n\nSo what exactly did we just do?\nFirst, you have created a cold staking script config which includes the public\nkey for the staking node to whom you have delegated staking powers to.\n\nSecond, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block\nfrom staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress\nbar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS\ncurrently does) but these outputs will be part of the cold staking script.\n\nThird, the next time you spend any Particl from your wallet the client will also\nautomatically include the cold staking script— from thereon. Once the Cold\nStaking progress bar reaches 100% activation your wallet can remain offline and\nthe staking node you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without\nrisking any of the PART in your wallet.\n\nIt is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script”\nsmart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies\nto cold staking:\n\n> if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same\naddress with the same minimum value as the input\nIn short, what this means is “If I staked 1,000 PART from my\nPar7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address then 1,000 PART must go back to the\nsame address” for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.\n\nThis is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake\nyour coins and not spend them.\n\nIt is also worth noting here that any value greater than the input value, aka\nthe reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node. So in\ntheory you could — as part of cold staking — send your staked coins back to your\nwallet address (as per consensus) and send the stake reward to a different\naddress.\n\n?Future Applications\nThis flexibility at the protocol consensus level pave the road for several new\nfeatures in the future such as:\n\n * staking pools\n * donating staking rewards to other causes\n * sending staking rewards to exchange to provide liquidity\n\nThe cold staking protocol is agnostic, so that it works with all public balances\n(anon and blind cannot stake) including those protected by multi-signature\naddresses.\n\nIn the future we envision an upgrade to our Particl Copay App that will add Cold\nStaking support. That will allow us to take advantage of the wallet’s excellent\nmulti-signature support and enable a whole host of new security benefits,\nincluding but not limited to:\n\n * cold staking with multi-signature (ie. your “staking node” will stake but to\n   spend funds you will need m-of-n signatures\n * integration with hardware devices (like Ledger or Trezor) for key signing\n   (providing the utmost level of security when combined with multi-signature\n   and cold staking).\n\nBrief statement about tomorrow’s hardfork\nAs the hardfork cometh at midnight, we’re going to let everyone continue to\nupgrade and track the health of the blockchain for around 12–24 hours. We know\neveryone is anxious to build their Cold Staking contract but what is most\nimportant is ensuring the blockchain and all PART are secure.\n\nThe GUI is getting waxed and buffed for tomorrow’s debut and we’re also\npreparing some guides for the GUI so people can walk through setting up your\ncold staking contracts.\n\nThank you\nParticl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Primer--Cold-Staking-on-Particl/0-HrZMzdYyRd0LIyut.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"quantum-computer-resistant\">Quantum Computer Resistant</h2><p><strong>How? </strong>In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public.

This can be a dedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.</p><blockquote>It is important to note that CPU <strong>does</strong> matter when staking, so do not expect to get the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.</blockquote><p>Once the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then generate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in the next step).</p><p><strong>**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will be made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is deemed secure.**</strong></p><p>2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold Staking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1). Enter this and click activate.</p><h3 id=\"so-what-exactly-did-we-just-do\">So what exactly did we just do?</h3><p>First, you have created a <strong>cold staking script</strong> config which includes the public key for the <strong>staking node</strong> to whom you have delegated staking powers to.</p><p>Second, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block from staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress bar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS currently does) but these outputs will be part of the <strong>cold staking script</strong>.</p><p>Third, the next time you spend any Particl from your <strong>wallet</strong> the client will also automatically include the <strong>cold staking script</strong> — from thereon. Once the Cold Staking progress bar reaches 100% activation your <strong>wallet</strong> can remain offline and the <strong>staking node</strong> you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without risking any of the PART in your wallet.</p><p><strong>It is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script” smart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies to cold staking:</strong></p><blockquote>if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same address with the same minimum value as the input</blockquote><p>In short, what this means is <em>“If I staked 1,000 PART from my Par7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address </em><em><strong>then</strong></em><em> 1,000 PART must go back to the same address”</em> for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.</p><p><strong>This is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake your coins and not spend them.</strong></p><p>It is also worth noting here that any value <strong>greater</strong> than the input value, aka the reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node. So in theory you could — as part of cold staking — send your staked coins back to your wallet address (as per consensus) and send the stake reward to a different address.</p><h2 id=\"-future-applications\">?Future Applications</h2><p>This flexibility at the protocol consensus level pave the road for several new features in the future such as:</p><ul><li>staking pools</li><li>donating staking rewards to other causes</li><li>sending staking rewards to exchange to provide liquidity</li></ul><p>The cold staking protocol is agnostic, so that it works with all public balances (anon and blind cannot stake) including those protected by multi-signature addresses.</p><p>In the future we envision an upgrade to our Particl Copay App that will add Cold Staking support.

Particl Foundation has been using Particl Copay to manage its affairs\nfor both BTC and PART since inception in July. Available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay] and our Particl\nGithub repository [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases].\n\nQ3 2017 | Particl Electron Wallet App—News Update\n[https://particl.news/built-on-electron-we-proudly-introduce-particl-wallet-v0-1-0-4f312c3df41f]\n\nThe first official builds for this product were for testnet only. However,\neveryone has been free to compile this wallet for mainnet since its release in\nSeptember. The Particl team will be releasing their first official builds of our\nGUI release for mainnet this week. The past 5 weeks have been all hands on deck\nto ensure we have a beautiful, smooth wallet ready for Cold Staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClosing Out\nQ4 2017 | Cold Staking—News Update\n[https://particl.news/alert-particl-hardfork-nov-10th-4ca5b994017c]\n\nThis Friday, Cold Staking will be activated on mainnet meaning it has graduated\nfrom the testing environment (testnet) into the arms of every user working on\nthe network!\n\nDon’t be left behind! You may be one of the nodes still running old protocol.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Additions\nQ4 2017 | Atomic Swaps\n\nThis quarter the PART blockchain will realize it’s not alone in this world! The\ngreat guys at Decred Project tested and approved the PR a couple weeks ago. Keep\na lookout for promotion of DCR/PART atomic swaps. We will continue to test and\ncollaborate cross chain transactions with other projects.

Indeed, at 00:00\nUTC, the Particl blockchain will hardfork to bring many critical changes to its\nProof-of-Stake protocol, insuring that its foundation is as strong and secure as\npossible before the long-awaited Particl privacy marketplace is released. The\ntwo main changes to the protocol are the introduction of cold staking and a\ndramatic increase in quantum computer resistance. The hardfork also enables\nprotocol support for staking pools and staking rewards management, meaning that\nwhile they will now be able to be implemented, they will not be present at the\ntime of the fork.\n\nParticl’s 10th of November Hardfork in one imageCold Staking\nThe main feature the hardfork will bring to Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol is\nthe ability to securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes”. The purpose\nof these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the\nParticl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to\nspend its coins.\n\nThe reason it is called “cold staking” is because this feature is intended to be\nused in combination with cold/hardware/paper wallets as well as multisig\naddresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being\nhacked.\n\nStaking nodes can be set up on public/cloud servers, virtual machines or even on\nRPIs. The staking environment theoretically doesn’t even need to be that much\nsecure since these nodes do not contain or cannot be linked to any coin, meaning\nthat you can pretty much stake from anywhere.\n\nIn the future, this feature is likely to become even more relevant when the\nParticl team will start developing the mobile wallet. This wallet is intended to\nhave most or all of the desktop features, but actually staking from a mobile\nphone is far from being ideal. Not only would the network connection be unstable\nat times, it would also use a lot of data as you’d need to constantly download\nevery blocks. With cold staking, you could simply stake your mobile funds from a\nRPI at home or any dedicated server and still get staking revenues from your\nmobile funds without busting the phone bill.\n\nQuantum Resistance\nCurrent Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in\nProof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they\nfind and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against\npublic key cryptography. On traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128\nbasic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public\nkeys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional\ncomputers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would\ntake a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic\nquantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm.\nThis might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are\nlikely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical. It could be\nestimated that it is maybe 2 to 5 years until quantum computers become an issue,\nbut any project that plans on staying relevant on a long period of time should\ntackle these vulnerabilities way before they become problematic.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that public keys are NOT public addresses. To reverse a\nprivate key from a public address, it would require more energy than what is\navailable in the universe, therefore a quantum hacker cannot just go pick public\naddresses with large amounts and reverse those.\n\nWhen a Particl block is created, the private key of the address that staked it\nis used to sign the block, effectively broadcasting its public key to the entire\nnetwork. After the hardfork, “staking nodes” that do not contain any coin will\nbe able to sign staked blocks on behalf of any wallet, hot or cold. Even if a\nquantum hacker successfully did reverse the staking node’s private key from its\npublic key, he would not find any coin to steal.\n\nStaking Pools (Protocol Support Only)\nOne very practical use case this hardfork enables is that it enables protocol\nsupport for staking pools. It means this feature will not be available at the\ntime of the fork, but is rendered possible to code due to the changes brought by\nthe hardfork.\n\nIt may not be immediately obvious why staking pools would be useful when you can\nsecurely stake from anywhere, but there are a couple of reasons some users may\nbe drawn towards using them. First of all, staking a low Particl balance may not\nalways be ideal. Since each staking reward is around 1.5 PART and the minimum\nyearly interest is 5%, there could be a lot of time in between staking rewards.\nFor example, if someone wanted to buy $500 worth of Particl priced at 25$, he\nwould end up with 20 PARTs. At 5% inflation rate, that person would earn around\n1 Particl a year, which is even less than a single staking reward.\n\nSimilarly to PoW mining where solo mining Bitcoin with a single GPU card is now\ncompletely impractical, users with small Particl balances could simply delegate\nstaking powers to pools and have them stake their coins on their behalf. As\nmentioned above, this will not be coded at the time of the fork, but it would be\npossible to configure staking nodes to be able to spend staking rewards only (no\naccess to the actual staking funds whatsoever).\n\nA pool operator could simply broadcast its staking node’s public key and have\nusers “connect” and stake from it. Since these nodes could spend the rewards but\nnot the staking funds, the pool operators could simply aggregate staking rewards\ninto their own wallets and make custom payouts (i.e. daily or small 0.05 PART\npayouts).\n\nAnother use-case for staking pools is that the entire process of setting up and\nmaintaining a secure staking node is outsourced to the pool operator. Users\nwould only need to “connect” to the staking pool and not have to worry about\nsetting up their own server/RPI. This is ideal for the less technical users that\nmay eventually end up using Particl.\n\nThe current problem with staking pools is the transaction fees. Since the goal\nis to send smaller than 1.5 PART payouts, there may be a point where sending\nvery small payouts would cost too much in terms of transaction fee. This is an\nissue that could easily be solved with the Lightning Network. Payment channels\ncould be opened between users and the pool wallets and could eventually achieve\nnear-zero transaction costs.\n\nStake To Alternative Address(es) (Protocol Support Only)\nA second powerful but underestimated feature the hardfork adds protocol support\nfor is the ability to fully manage staking rewards. This allows users to select\nwhere the rewards should go and in what percentage. This function will not be\ncoded at the time of the fork, but it will now be possible to do it.\n\nBy default, staking rewards are given to the same address that stake (find and\nsign) a block. With this “alternative address” feature enabled, users would be\nable to automatically have these staking rewards sent to any public addresses\nand in any percentage. This killer feature leverages the amazing power of the\nParticl Proof-of-Stake protocol and enables a brand new way to spend, invest and\ndonate money in a completely passive way. Here are a couple of examples that I\nbelieve could really help the Particl project make a name for itself:\n\n1) Passive donations to crypto influencers\nThis, in my opinion, is a very powerful grassroots marketing strategy. The idea\nis to have crypto public figures such as youtubers or crypto celebs get a\nParticl address and share it. Then any Particl staker can choose the\ninfluencer’s address as a receiver of X% of his staking rewards. If enough\nstakers participate, the aggregated effect could make these passive donations\nquite large. If a crypto youtuber received 500$ worth of Particl everyday for\nsome time, he’s for sure going to look in to the project at one point and the\nother and then maybe start talking about it.\n\n2) Passive funding of community initiatives\nAnother brilliant way to use this potential feature is by creating community\nfunds and bounties. If a community member has an idea for a Particl Dapp,\nwidget, integration or marketing idea he could simply set up a public address\nand have X% of his staking rewards sent to it. If his idea gains traction within\nthe community, other stakers could also start funding the initiative’s address\nand eventually create a sizable bounty to attract contributors. Combined with\nParticl’s decentralized voting, it is an entire decentralized ecosystem that\nenables the users to make things happen and get ideas funded without the need of\nany middleman.\n\n3) Passive donations to organizations\nThis use-case is a bit more philanthropic, but practical nonetheless. Passive\ndonations could be set up to any organization or charity that sets up a Particl\npublic address. These organizations could be, for example, ones that seeks to\nfight for privacy and security like the TOR organization or the EFF. Not only\nwould this help them accomplish their goals, but it would also be a good\nmarketing strategy as many of these organizations display/showcase their big\ndonors.\n\n4) Budgeting & Diversification\nMany addresses could be set up with different purposes and be passively funded\nusing Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol. This would make it easier for stakers\nto save or invest money and would be an ideal budgeting strategy. For example, a\nuser could set up a “Vacations Fund”, “Real Estate Downpayment Fund” or a\n“University Fund” and have any percentage of their daily staking rewards sent\nover there. Then, once they would reach their respective funding target, the\nfunds they hold could be traded for fiat and then used to fulfil the goal they\nwere initially created for. Alternatively, this same user could also set up a\n“Bitcoin Investment Fund” or “altcoin Investment Fund” where every week the\nPARTs they hold would be traded for BTCs or other altcoins using a GUI in-wallet\ntoken exchange application (such as Changelly, Shapeshift or flyp.me). This\nwould make it easy for stakers to diversify their holdings into different coins\nwhile at the same time providing exchanges with more liquidity and volume\n\nWhile not implemented yet, this is how Shapeshift would look on the\nParticl walletParticl currently has ~1.5 PART staking rewards and blocks of 2\nminutes, meaning that roughly 1080 PARTs are created everyday. Priced at 7.50$,\nit is worth $8,100 and this daily source of funds will keep growing in value as\nParticl’s price increases. If enough stakers use this feature as a marketing\nstrategy, the aggregated effect it could generate would definitely get people\ntalking. You can only last so long not digging into a project that is funding\nyou hundreds of dollars everyday!\n\nThe hardfork is scheduled for November 10th 2017, 00:00 UTC so make sure you\nupgrade your client to at least version 0.15.2 before that time. You do not need\nto move any wallet file, simply run the client from the updated folder! Since\nthe Particl marketplace will also require a hardfork, it will be interesting to\nobserve how the cold staking hardfork will unfold. At the time of this writing,\n54% of the network has updated, so it seems things should go smoothly.","html":"<p>Particl, a decentralized privacy platform and cryptocurrency, is just about to go through its first hardfork on the 10th of November 2017.

Indeed, at 00:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain will hardfork to bring many critical changes to its Proof-of-Stake protocol, insuring that its foundation is as strong and secure as possible before the long-awaited Particl privacy marketplace is released. The two main changes to the protocol are the introduction of cold staking and a dramatic increase in quantum computer resistance. The hardfork also enables protocol support for staking pools and staking rewards management, meaning that while they will now be able to be implemented, they will not be present at the time of the fork.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-10th-of-November-Hardfork--Cold-Staking---Quantum-Resistance/1-y9pBRrNFWhMCSE2i49Jsiw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s 10th of November Hardfork in one image</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"cold-staking\">Cold Staking</h2><p>The main feature the hardfork will bring to Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol is the ability to securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes”. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the Particl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins.</p><p>The reason it is called “cold staking” is because this feature is intended to be used in combination with cold/hardware/paper wallets as well as multisig addresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being hacked.</p><p>Staking nodes can be set up on public/cloud servers, virtual machines or even on RPIs. The staking environment theoretically doesn’t even need to be that much secure since these nodes do not contain or cannot be linked to any coin, meaning that you can pretty much stake from anywhere.</p><p>In the future, this feature is likely to become even more relevant when the Particl team will start developing the mobile wallet. This wallet is intended to have most or all of the desktop features, but actually staking from a mobile phone is far from being ideal. Not only would the network connection be unstable at times, it would also use a lot of data as you’d need to constantly download every blocks. With cold staking, you could simply stake your mobile funds from a RPI at home or any dedicated server and still get staking revenues from your mobile funds without busting the phone bill.</p><h2 id=\"quantum-resistance\">Quantum Resistance</h2><p>Current Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in Proof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they find and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against public key cryptography. On traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128 basic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public keys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional computers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would take a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm. This might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are likely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical.
