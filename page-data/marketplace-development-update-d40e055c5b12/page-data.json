This feature has now successfully been implemented\non RegTest (pre-testnet) and is fully working\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]. Some of the Particl\ndevelopers are now using the time between now and the mainnet release to make it\nmore resource-efficient and smoother to use. As Arnold Bansemer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] says, “Better to use the time we have until\nthe release to get it done properly now rather than just enough to make it work”\n.\n\nRealigns market-beta branch with market branch by zaSmilingIdiot · Pull Request\n#1512 ·… [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]\nThis opts for the non-destructive (albeit 'muddy') commit history. This is in\npreparation for reviewing and merging of…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1512]\n\nThe multi-wallets feature should hit testnet somewhere this week or early next\nweek. Visit particl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826] \n later this week as we will publish a full article explaining everything there\nis to know about multi-wallets.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nDemonstrating in real-time the Open Marketplace in Hong Kong has been a very\nconstructive exercise. It showed the current V2.0 build to be pretty stable and\nable to handle hours of demonstration without really causing any issue. It has\nalso been the best opportunity we’ve ever had to test the decentralized\ngovernance mechanism of the marketplace.\n\nIn fact, while we were at the conference demonstrating the marketplace,\nundesirable products started to be listed by some testnet user. Remember, the\nOpen Marketplace is entirely decentralized. No party can singlehandedly remove\nlistings from it. Still, we wanted to keep the marketplace as clean as possible\nas we were showing it off.\n\nLuckily, the Particl testnet network is different from the mainnet network. It\nis tweaked in a way where the Particl team holds a large sum of testnet coins.\nThis is to ensure the network can run smoothly with a low number of nodes and\nthat the team can easily test the decentralized governance mechanism.\n\nWe did successfully take those listings off using the builds we had at the\nconference. This confirms and validates that the decentralized governance\nmechanism is now ready for mainnet!\n\nCT Escrow (Privacy Enabled by Default)\nThe implementation of CT transactions in the escrow smart-contract makes all\nmarketplace transactions untraceable — amounts will be hidden — by default. This\nrequires a special form of escrow that processes transactions using only CT. —\nSee OMP Library and Bitcoin 0.18 below for more info.\n\nThe Particl developers already have a working escrow in RegTest (pre-testnet)\nthat works using RingCT transactions only. By playing around with it, they\nrealized modifying it so that it could work using CT transactions (instead of\nRingCT) would be relatively easy. It would also protect the integrity of the\nproject. Particl is, after all, a privacy-focused project. It is not looking\ninto compromising privacy or security for anything else. This is why we’ve\ndecided to implement CT transactions before releasing the Open Marketplace on\nmainnet.\n\nAs it stands today, the escrow mechanism has been successfully converted to work\nwith CT transactions. The team is currently fine-tuning some of the system’s\nparameters and working on the full integration into the marketplace. This escrow\nsystem will effectively replace the one currently in place on testnet.\n\nThe good news is that most of the heavy lifting has already been done in regards\nto this task. The integration and fine-tuning processes are trivial in\ncomparison.\n\nOMP Library\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is based on the Open Market Protocol (OMP)\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/] developed by Particl developer \nKewde [https://github.com/kewde]. It is a standardized and open format\ncontaining most of the economic interactions of an online marketplace. This\nlibrary gives the Open Marketplace’s backend much more flexibility and options\nthan it currently has. While it was already implemented into the marketplace, \nits full integration is necessary for the new escrow model to function.\n\nExcept for the new CT escrow, the OMP Library will not offer any\nnoticeable/visible improvements until some point in the future. In fact, all it\ndoes is give the back-end of the marketplace more tools and parameters to\nleverage (i.e. custom listing fields\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/public-listing-format/extended/extended-listing.html]\n, escrow refunds & negotiations\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/private-message-format/overview.html]\n, etc). The library will, however, prove itself to be essential as we move\nforward into the Beta phase of development.\n\nThe OMP Library is still currently being implemented into the marketplace and\nParticl Desktop application.\n\nUI/UX Tweaks\nNew Hover Function Shows Spendable, Locked, and Total Balance Anywhere on\nParticl DesktopWhile we were presenting the marketplace in Hong Kong, we met\nmany people coming from different backgrounds and with different experiences.\nThis has generated for us a long list of feedback, comments, and suggestions,\nlots of them being about UI/UX improvements.\n\nSome of our developers have taken this list and started implementing the\nsuggestions we think will improve the user experience. These tweaks are minor\nand won’t take much time to resolve. They are not function-related issues, but\nmerely visual fixes. At this moment, The Open Marketplace’s interface is ready\nfor mainnet. These tweaks will only make it better.\n\nBitcoin Codebase 0.18\nHave you noticed that all the latest testnet versions of the Open Marketplace\nhave been running on Particl Core 0.18 while the mainnet version of Particl\nDesktop still operates on Particl Core 0.17? That’s because most of the\nmodifications we’ve made to the marketplace in the last few weeks have been\nbuilt with Particl Core 0.18 in mind.\n\nThere have been lots of issues when testing testnet (0.18) within the same\nenvironment as a mainnet wallet (0.17). This is due to a so-called “backward\ncompatibility” issue — some of the new features may need to be integrated\ndifferently on 0.17 than on 0.18. Yes, we are definitely serious when praising \nTecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert] for his amazing work. Keeping Particl’s\ncodebase, as well as everything built on top of it, up-to-date with Bitcoin’s\nlatest core version is a complex, ever-evolving, and time-consuming task.\n\nWe’ve been following the development of Bitcoin Core 0.18 very closely. We’ve\nalso been constantly preparing all the changes required for the update\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]. Earlier this month,\nthe Bitcoin developers have released the tentative release date of April 3rd for\nthe 0.18 Bitcoin update.\n\nRelease schedule for 0.18.0 · Issue #14438 · bitcoin/bitcoin\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]\nHere is a proposed release schedule for 0.18.0, the next major release of\nBitcoin Core. Like for previous major…\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]github.com\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438]\n\n * Click here to read the full Bitcoin Core 0.18 Release Notes\n   [https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.18.0-Release-Notes-Draft]\n\nSince the release date of Bitcoin Core is scheduled for after the end of Q1, we\nwould need to modify a lot of components of the marketplace so that they could\nwork on Particl Core 0.17. They would then need to be reverted back to their\ninitial form (built for 0.18) only a few days after the first mainnet release.\nThis would be an unnecessarily time-consuming process that wouldn’t provide any\nadded benefit to the marketplace. This is the main driver for why the mainnet\nrelease of the “official” Open Marketplace builds will go just a few days into\nQ2.\n\nWe’ve also always said we didn’t want to release a Bitcoin codebase version\nprior to Bitcoin doing it. This is not only a mark of respect for the developers\nworking on this incredible codebase but a security measure for the Particl\nproject. This is why we always wait a couple of days before updating our\ncodebase — should there be any issue on Bitcoin’s end, we would wait for it to\nbe resolved before updating our codebase.\n\nThis is why we have taken the decision to wait for Particl Core to update to its\n0.18 version before releasing the marketplace on mainnet. Not only will this\nsave a good amount of development time (which will be used more efficiently),\nbut it will also allow developers to keep perfecting the release and run more\ntests while we wait for the Particl Core 0.18 update.\n\n> Note: The current Alpha Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 has successfully been tested\non mainnet. There hasn’t been any new identifiable issue as a result of this\ninternal test.\nGeneral Small Tweaks & Fixes\nAs always, the Particl developers are constantly making tweaks, fixes, and\nimprovements to all the components of the marketplace. This will always be the\ncase as we strive to offer the best, blockchain product in the industry, bar\nnone. Don’t forget to log any feedback, suggestion, bug, or comment on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. This is the best way to\nattract the attention of one of Particl’s developers and is the quickest way to\nmake changes happen!\n\n> NOTE: For more information about what item are being worked on and reviewed,\nplease visit the Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report/] page on\nParticl.io\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainnet Release Timeframe\nWith all the above considered, we’d like to make the mainnet release timeframe\nclearer. At this moment, we’ve successfully tested the Open Marketplace Alpha\n2.0 on mainnet, without any issue. We will, however, publicly release the first\nmainnet version of it only after Particl Core 0.18 is released —taking us into\nmid-April if the current Bitcoin release schedule\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438] sticks. That’s because we need\nto let Bitcoin Core 0.18 run on Bitcoin for a couple of days, make sure no issue\narises, update Particl Core to 0.18, and then push the Open Marketplace on\nmainnet.\n\nThe short time between now and the date of the mainnet release for the\nmarketplace will allow Particl developers to implement the changes and fixes\nidentified in TOKEN2049 as well as fine-tune and improve the initial mainnet\nfeatures (CT escrow, multi-wallets, interface, etc). This small extra time will\nalso allow them to run more tests and deliver a more stable first mainnet build.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you’ve been looking into selling and buying stuff on the Open Marketplace,\nthen now is definitely the time to get prepared! Particl is going to unlock the\nfull potential of global online commerce and will lead to the biggest revolution\nthe eCommerce sector has ever had. It only gets more exciting from this point\nonward.\n\nWe have a lot of content coming in the next few days — announcements, future\nfeatures sneak peeks, explainers, blog posts, videos, tutorials, and etc. Don’t\nmiss any of it by joining us on the awesome Particl Discord\n[http://discord.me/particl] server!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Marketplace-Development-Update/1-XhMg71IgwzJvwt1wCmxSOQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"mainnet-features-progress-outstanding-items\">Mainnet Features, Progress, &amp; Outstanding Items</h3><p>We packed our bags and headed off to TOKEN2049 last week with the Open Marketplace in tow.

This is why we always wait a couple of days before updating our codebase — should there be any issue on Bitcoin’s end, we would wait for it to be resolved before updating our codebase.</p><p>This is why <strong>we have taken the decision to wait for Particl Core to update to its 0.18 version before releasing the marketplace on mainnet.</strong> Not only will this save a good amount of development time (which will be used more efficiently), but it will also allow developers to keep perfecting the release and run more tests while we wait for the Particl Core 0.18 update.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The current Alpha Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 has successfully been tested on mainnet.

At this moment, <strong>we’ve successfully tested the Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on mainnet, without any issue. </strong>We will, however, publicly release the first mainnet version of it only after Particl Core 0.18 is released — <strong>taking us into mid-April</strong> if the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><strong>current Bitcoin release schedule</strong></a> sticks. That’s because we need to let Bitcoin Core 0.18 run on Bitcoin for a couple of days, make sure no issue arises, update Particl Core to 0.18, and then push the Open Marketplace on mainnet.</p><p>The short time between now and the date of the mainnet release for the marketplace will allow Particl developers to implement the changes and fixes identified in TOKEN2049 as well as fine-tune and improve the initial mainnet features (CT escrow, multi-wallets, interface, etc). This small extra time will also allow them to run more tests and deliver a more stable first mainnet build.</p><hr><p>If you’ve been looking into selling and buying stuff on the Open Marketplace, then now is definitely the time to get prepared!

It showed the current V2.0 build to be pretty stable and able to handle hours of demonstration without really causing any issue. It has also been the best opportunity we’ve ever had to test the decentralized governance mechanism of the marketplace.</p><p>In fact, while we were at the conference demonstrating the marketplace, undesirable products started to be listed by some testnet user. Remember, the Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized. No party can singlehandedly remove listings from it. Still, we wanted to keep the marketplace as clean as possible as we were showing it off.</p><p>Luckily, the Particl testnet network is different from the mainnet network. It is tweaked in a way where the Particl team holds a large sum of testnet coins. This is to ensure the network can run smoothly with a low number of nodes and that the team can easily test the decentralized governance mechanism.</p><p>We did successfully take those listings off using the builds we had at the conference. <strong>This confirms and validates that the decentralized governance mechanism is now ready for mainnet!</strong></p><h3 id=\"ct-escrow-privacy-enabled-by-default-\">CT Escrow (Privacy Enabled by Default)</h3><p>The implementation of CT transactions in the escrow smart-contract makes all marketplace transactions untraceable — amounts will be hidden — by default. This requires a special form of escrow that processes transactions using only CT. — <em>See OMP Library and Bitcoin 0.18 below for more info.</em></p><p>The Particl developers already have a working escrow in RegTest (pre-testnet) that works using RingCT transactions only. By playing around with it, they realized modifying it so that it could work using CT transactions (instead of RingCT) would be relatively easy. It would also protect the integrity of the project. Particl is, after all, a privacy-focused project. It is not looking into compromising privacy or security for anything else. This is why we’ve decided to implement CT transactions before releasing the Open Marketplace on mainnet.</p><p>As it stands today, <strong>the escrow mechanism has been successfully converted to work with CT transactions. The team is currently fine-tuning some of the system’s parameters and working on the full integration into the marketplace.</strong> This escrow system will effectively replace the one currently in place on testnet.</p><p>The good news is that most of the heavy lifting has already been done in regards to this task. The integration and fine-tuning processes are trivial in comparison.</p><h3 id=\"omp-library\">OMP Library</h3><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is based on the <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>Open Market Protocol (OMP)</strong></a> developed by Particl developer <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a>. It is a standardized and open format containing most of the economic interactions of an online marketplace. This library gives the Open Marketplace’s backend much more flexibility and options than it currently has. While it was already implemented into the marketplace, <strong>its full integration is necessary for the new escrow model to function</strong>.</p><p>Except for the new CT escrow, the OMP Library will not offer any noticeable/visible improvements until some point in the future. In fact, all it does is give the back-end of the marketplace more tools and parameters to leverage (i.e. <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/public-listing-format/extended/extended-listing.html\"><strong>custom listing fields</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/private-message-format/overview.html\"><strong>escrow refunds &#x26; negotiations</strong></a>, etc). The library will, however, prove itself to be essential as we move forward into the Beta phase of development.</p><p><strong>The OMP Library is still currently being implemented</strong> into the marketplace and Particl Desktop application.</p><h3 id=\"ui-ux-tweaks\">UI/UX Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Marketplace-Development-Update/1-D6BnpiVqXou3h9LJUEKeVg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>New Hover Function Shows Spendable, Locked, and Total Balance Anywhere on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>While we were presenting the marketplace in Hong Kong, we met many people coming from different backgrounds and with different experiences. This has generated for us a long list of feedback, comments, and suggestions, lots of them being about UI/UX improvements.</p><p>Some of our developers have taken this list and started implementing the suggestions we think will improve the user experience. <strong>These tweaks are minor and won’t take much time to resolve.</strong> They are not function-related issues, but merely visual fixes.<strong> At this moment, The Open Marketplace’s interface is ready for mainnet. </strong>These<strong> </strong>tweaks will only make it better.</p><h3 id=\"bitcoin-codebase-0-18\">Bitcoin Codebase 0.18</h3><p>Have you noticed that all the latest testnet versions of the Open Marketplace have been running on Particl Core 0.18 while the mainnet version of Particl Desktop still operates on Particl Core 0.17? That’s because most of the modifications we’ve made to the marketplace in the last few weeks have been built with Particl Core 0.18 in mind.</p><p>There have been lots of issues when testing testnet (0.18) within the same environment as a mainnet wallet (0.17). This is due to a so-called “backward compatibility” issue — some of the new features may need to be integrated differently on 0.17 than on 0.18. Yes, we are definitely serious when praising <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a> for his amazing work. Keeping Particl’s codebase, as well as everything built on top of it, up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest core version is a complex, ever-evolving, and time-consuming task.</p><p>We’ve been following the development of Bitcoin Core 0.18 very closely. We’ve also been <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\">constantly preparing all the changes required for the update</a>. Earlier this month, the Bitcoin developers have released the <strong>tentative release date of April 3rd </strong>for the 0.18 Bitcoin update.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><strong>Release schedule for 0.18.0 · Issue #14438 · bitcoin/bitcoin</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14438\"><em>Here is a proposed release schedule for 0.18.0, the next major release of Bitcoin Core.

They would then need to be reverted back to their initial form (built for 0.18) only a few days after the first mainnet release. This would be an unnecessarily time-consuming process that wouldn’t provide any added benefit to the marketplace.

Today, we’d\nlike to dive deeper into the upcoming multi-wallet capabilities of Particl\nDesktop.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Multi-Wallets?\nMulti-Wallets, as they were displayed on previous test builds (subject\nto change)Multi-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been\navailable on Particl-Qt ever since Particl forked to codebase version 0.15. We\nare, however, now bringing this important feature onto our most popular client:\nParticl Desktop.\n\nWhat if you could manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop\ninstance? What if you could do it without breaking a sweat? This is exactly what\nthis multi-wallet feature allows you to do! It enables the ability to securely\nmanage multiple wallets from a single Particl Desktop instance without requiring\nyou to restart the wallet or mess with the wallet files (wallet.dat).\n\nWhen using multi-wallets, your identity, transaction history, and any other\nParticl-related data (i.e. listings, contact information, messages, etc) are\nperfectly isolated from the other wallets hosted on your Particl Desktop. This\nmakes it impossible for this information to leak into another wallet.\n\nMulti-wallets serve multiple purposes within the Particl ecosystem and will be\nan important feature moving forward. As time goes by, and as the Particl\ninfrastructure expands, they will become truly indispensable.\n\nSecurity & Privacy\nMulti-wallets are first and foremost a security and privacy feature. The reason\nwhy is that all the data from a wallet (i.e. transaction details, listings,\ncontact information, messages, votes, listing flags, etc) is perfectly isolated\nfrom other wallets installed on the same Particl Desktop. All multi-wallets are\nalso encrypted independently and have their own password.\n\nIn computer security, this ability can be compared pretty closely to the \nsecurity by isolation model. This model proposes that one of the best and most\neffective ways to secure data from multiple environments is by isolating them\nfrom each other. Particl Desktop achieves similar results by completely\nisolating the wallet files (wallet.dat) from each other.\n\nIn other words, if you are managing two (or more) different wallets from the\nsame Particl Desktop instance, it is as if you were managing them from different\ncomputers entirely. Wallet data cannot leak out into another wallet, just like\ndata from a computer cannot leak out into another computer by itself.\n\n> Note: This doesn’t mean your data is safe if your computer gets hacked into.\nWhile the wallet files themselves are isolated on the Particl Desktop client,\nthey are not isolated inside your computer itself. They are still stored in the\nsame place in your Particl configuration folder. The only way to secure your\nfunds against hackers that would breach into your computer is to store them on a\nhardware device like the Ledger Nano S (1 [https://particl.wiki/ledger], 2\n[https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking], 3\n[https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac]\n).\nSecurity — Eliminating Human Errors\nOf course, managing multiple wallets has always been kind of possible to do, but\nit’s definitely never been convenient. In fact, if you want to switch wallets on\nParticl Desktop without using multi-wallets, you can actually go through a\npainful manual routine that goes as follow:\n\n * Create a folder containing all of your wallet files (named differently)\n * Shut Particl Desktop down\n * Navigate to your Particl configuration folder\n * Backup your wallet.dat file and move it to the wallet folder you just created\n * Give it a different name (i.e. wallet_spending.dat)\n * In your wallet folder, pick the wallet file of the wallet you want to switch\n   to\n * Move it into your Particl configuration folder\n * Rename it to wallet.dat\n * Start Particl Desktop\n * Rinse and repeat every time you want to switch wallet\n\nAlmost cringeworthy, right? Not only is this very tedious set of steps a serious\nobstacle to regularly using multiple wallets, but it’s also a bit of a security\nrisk. That’s because, on a long enough timeline, we are all guaranteed to make\nmistakes. Indeed, research suggests that the great majority of information\nleaks\nand incidents are due to human errors\n[https://iapp.org/news/a/data-indicates-human-error-prevailing-cause-of-breaches-incidents/]\n, not hacks or malicious breaches.\n\nImage Source: iapp.org> “There is a tendency to assume incidents exposing\nsensitive, regulated data occur as a result of an organization being “under\nattack.” Seasoned privacy professionals, however, know that in reality, the\nmajority of incidents are inadvertent and unintentional, and can be classified\nas human error.” —Mahmood Sher-Jan\n[https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlQM8AAN/]\nWho’s to say you won’t ever forget to back a wallet file up before manually\nswitching? That you won’t overwrite a file by mistake? With multi-wallets, you\ndon’t need to worry about these human errors anymore. This feature makes\nswitching between wallets safe, quick, and easy.\n\nPrivacy — Address Association Prevention\nYou probably know by now that you shouldn’t reuse deposit addresses for privacy\nreasons. In fact, anyone that knows an address of yours can look it up on a\nblock explorer and analyze the transactions you’ve made with it in the past.\nWhat’s worse is that, not only can anyone look up your address on the\nblockchain, they can also do the same to all of the addresses associated,\ndirectly or indirectly, with it. To keep it simple, an address is “associated”\nwith another address if it has received or sent payments to it.\n\nImage Source: @iang (Steemit.com)This is why using new deposit addresses when\naccepting payments is the recommended behavior for the great majority of\ncryptocurrencies. To increase the number of users doing just that, more and more\ncrypto wallets have started generating brand new addresses by default when\nrequesting payments. This type of wallet is called a Hierarchical Deterministic\n(HD) wallet\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp]\n. It is what Particl uses for its wallet clients.\n\nThere are, however, other privacy-related issues that still stand unresolved.\nEven when receiving payments with new addresses, you can still easily reveal\nyour other ones. That’s because unused addresses get associated with any other\naddress to which it sends a payment to. It also gets associated with any address\nfurther down the transactional chain, meaning “associated addresses of\nassociated addresses”.\n\nIn other words, if someone sends you a payment to an unused address, and then\nafter some time you send that payment to your main stash, you effectively reveal\nyour main stash information (number of coins, who you’ve made and received\npayments to, who they’ve sent and received payments to as well, and etc) to the\nperson that paid you. Of course, blockchain analysis can reveal public addresses\nthat receive and send payments. It can’t, however, tell ‘who’ exactly the\naddresses belong to unless it is already known that an associated address\nbelongs to a certain entity (i.e. by sending funds to an exchange).\n\nWould you want a stranger to know how much you own? Would you want an exchange\nto know everything you do with your personal coins not stored on their platform?\nWould you want any person, organization, or company associated with blockchain\ndata analysis firms\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com] \nto be able to mine all of your data?\n\n> Last week, cryptocurrency industry giant Coinbase sparked outrage when it \nannounced\n[https://blog.coinbase.com/welcoming-neutrino-to-coinbase-b3f56171850d] that it\nhad purchased a small startup called Neutrino.Normally, such an acquisition\nwouldn’t make many waves, but Neutrino isn’t your average startup. The company\nwas founded by three former employees of Hacking Team\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=hacking+team+vice&oq=hacking+team+vice&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.4680j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8]\n, a controversial Italian surveillance vendor that was caught several times \nselling spyware to governments\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nzeg5x/here-are-all-the-sketchy-government-agencies-buying-hacking-teams-spy-tech] \nwith dubious human rights records, such as Ethiopia\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypwk4j/ethiopia-allegedly-used-spyware-against-us-based-journalists-again]\n, Saudi Arabia\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xvzyp/hacking-team-investor-saudi-arabia]\n, and Sudan. —Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/contributor/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai]\n\nWith these technologies becoming increasingly effective AND accessible, we need\nmore diverse and solid solutions to protect our digital privacy.\n\nPrivacy — Stop Mixing UTXOs\nWhat’s more, there is another privacy concern when making transactions after\nyour received payments. Let’s say you accept two 10 PART payments (20 PART\ntotal, deposited on two different unused addresses). Then, for some reason, you\nneed to make a payment worth 15 PART AFTER receiving your two 10 PART payments.\nEven though both payments were received on different addresses, making a 15 PART\npayment would use outputs from both addresses, effectively linking them\ntogether. That’s because these addresses have less than 15 PART, so coins from\nboth addresses need to be used.\n\nThis would effectively link both addresses since the party you send the payment\nto will see the funds coming from two different addresses. This is a big privacy\nissue (and the reason why the Coin Control feature of Particl-Qt is so\npowerful)!\n\nwtokensw.com> Note: In the example above, TX 6 used outputs from both TX 4 and TX5 (two\ndifferent addresses) to fund its inputs. Although both TX 4 and TX 5 were\nalready linked together because of TX 0 and TX 2, one of the output used to send\nfunds to TX 6 could have also come from a fictive TX 7 — an output not\npreviously associated with any part of that chain of transactions. This would\nlink TX 7 and TX 6 together, as well as all outputs and inputs directly or\nindirectly associated with TX 7 and TX 6.\nBy using multi-wallets, you can create new wallets every time you want to accept\npayments or use different wallets per types or categories of transactions (i.e.\na wallet to receive marketplace payments, another to receive staking rewards,\nanother to deposit and withdraw coins from exchanges, and etc).This method of\nsecuring your privacy by isolating the wallets from each other mix really well\nwith the privacy protocols of the PART coin. In fact, you can achieve much\nstronger privacy by combining RingCT/CT transactions to a solid wallet isolation\nstrategy.\n\nConvenience — How Do I Change Wallets?\nAs with everything Particl Desktop, convenience and ease-of-use is a big focus,\nbut there are no compromises made on the security end of things. Multi-wallets\nare directly in line with this approach and make switching between different\nwallets as easy as it can possibly be. Remember the tedious 9-step process for\nswitching wallets mentioned above? It’s been reduced to only one easy step:\n\n * Click on the tab of the wallet you want to use\n\nThat’s right, as simple as clicking a button! Ain’t that security made easy? No\nneed to rename or even mess with wallet.dat files, no need to restart Particl\nDesktop every time you want to switch wallets, and most importantly, no need to\npass on benefiting from security through isolation because the process of doing\nso is too annoying! ?\n\nCold Staking & Multi-Wallets — A Match Made in Heaven\nThis new multi-wallet feature is certainly a great security and privacy add-on\nto Particl Desktop, but its usefulness doesn’t stop there! In fact, each wallet\nhosted under the same Particl Desktop instance can be linked to its own cold\nstaking key. That means you can have multiple wallets staking from different\nsources, with different addresses to receive (or send) your staking rewards.\n\nLet’s say you have three different wallets and want to set your staking setup\nwith failsafe capabilities. You could then create three cold staking node, and\nlink each of them to a different wallet. If one node goes down, then only a part\nof your coins stop staking, not all of them. Even better, you could set up a\nnode on an RPi, one on a VPS, and use the public key of a cold staking pool as\nyour third node. This way, you would be staking from three different cold\nstaking nodes hosted under three very different environments. This adds a bit of\nredundancy to your staking setup and is a failsafe measure in case an issue\narises with one of the nodes.\n\nPerhaps even more interesting, though, is the ability to better manage staking\nrewards. With the possibility to stake on multiple nodes within the same Particl\nDesktop instance, multi-wallets enable a whole range of new possibilities. What\nif you don’t want to keep all your staking rewards in PART? What if you only\nwant to keep 50%, have 25% sent to an address used for trading and the other 25%\nas donations? What if you wanted to set multiple addresses up, each having its\nown purpose (i.e. spending, saving, trading, vacations, joint address with a\nloved one, purchases on the marketplace, health fund, and etc).\n\nDoing exactly this has always been possible, of course. All you needed to do was\nto set up multiple wallets and cycle through them using the tedious 9-step\nprocess mentioned above. But now, with multi-wallets, it’s going to be as easy,\naccessible, and quick as it’s ever been!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMulti-wallets bring added privacy, security, and convenience to Particl Desktop\nand open a lot of possibilities for almost every type of users.

The reason why is that all the data from a wallet (i.e. transaction details, listings, contact information, messages, votes, listing flags, etc) is perfectly isolated from other wallets installed on the same Particl Desktop.

The reason why is that all the data from a wallet (i.e. transaction details, listings, contact information, messages, votes, listing flags, etc) is perfectly isolated from other wallets installed on the same Particl Desktop. All multi-wallets are also encrypted independently and have their own password.</p><p>In computer security, this ability can be compared pretty closely to the <em><strong>security by isolation </strong></em>model. This model proposes that one of the best and most effective ways to secure data from multiple environments is by isolating them from each other. Particl Desktop achieves similar results by completely isolating the wallet files (wallet.dat) from each other.</p><p>In other words, <strong>if you are managing two (or more) different wallets from the same Particl Desktop instance, it is as if you were managing them from different computers entirely</strong>. Wallet data cannot leak out into another wallet, just like data from a computer cannot leak out into another computer by itself.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This doesn’t mean your data is safe if your computer gets hacked into. While the wallet files themselves are isolated on the Particl Desktop client, they are not isolated inside your computer itself. They are still stored in the same place in your Particl configuration folder. The only way to secure your funds against hackers that would breach into your computer is to store them on a hardware device like the Ledger Nano S (<a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\"><strong>2</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac\"><strong>3</strong></a>).</blockquote><h3 id=\"security-eliminating-human-errors\">Security — Eliminating Human Errors</h3><p>Of course, managing multiple wallets has always been<em> kind of</em> possible to do, but it’s definitely never been convenient. In fact, if you want to switch wallets on Particl Desktop without using multi-wallets, you can actually go through a painful manual routine that goes as follow:</p><ul><li>Create a folder containing all of your wallet files (named differently)</li><li>Shut Particl Desktop down</li><li>Navigate to your Particl configuration folder</li><li>Backup your wallet.dat file and move it to the wallet folder you just created</li><li>Give it a different name (i.e. wallet_spending.dat)</li><li>In your wallet folder, pick the wallet file of the wallet you want to switch to</li><li>Move it into your Particl configuration folder</li><li>Rename it to wallet.dat</li><li>Start Particl Desktop</li><li>Rinse and repeat every time you want to switch wallet</li></ul><p>Almost cringeworthy, right? Not only is this very tedious set of steps a serious obstacle to regularly using multiple wallets, but it’s also a bit of a security risk. That’s because, on a long enough timeline, we are all guaranteed to make mistakes. Indeed, <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/data-indicates-human-error-prevailing-cause-of-breaches-incidents/\"><strong>research suggests that the great majority of information leaks and incidents are due to human errors</strong></a>, not hacks or malicious breaches.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-evJaI7FtM6TigszkiDFhOA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Image Source: iapp.org</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“There is a tendency to assume incidents exposing sensitive, regulated data occur as a result of an organization being “under attack.” Seasoned privacy professionals, however, know that in reality, the majority of incidents are inadvertent and unintentional, and can be classified as human error.” — <a href=\"https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlQM8AAN/\">Mahmood Sher-Jan</a></blockquote><p>Who’s to say you won’t ever forget to back a wallet file up before manually switching?

In fact, anyone that knows an address of yours can look it up on a block explorer and analyze the transactions you’ve made with it in the past. What’s worse is that, not only can anyone look up your address on the blockchain, they can also do the same to all of the addresses associated, directly or indirectly, with it. To keep it simple, an address is “associated” with another address if it has received or sent payments to it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-6_Hg2rf31nErsKnFK0k4Tw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Image Source: @iang (Steemit.com)</figcaption></figure><p>This is why using new deposit addresses when accepting payments is the recommended behavior for the great majority of cryptocurrencies. To increase the number of users doing just that, more and more crypto wallets have started generating brand new addresses by default when requesting payments. This type of wallet is called a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp\"><strong>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet</strong></a><strong>. </strong>It is what Particl uses for its wallet clients.</p><p>There are, however, other privacy-related issues that still stand unresolved. Even when receiving payments with new addresses, you can still easily reveal your other ones. That’s because unused addresses get associated with any other address to which it sends a payment to. It also gets associated with any address further down the transactional chain, meaning “associated addresses of associated addresses”.</p><p>In other words, if someone sends you a payment to an unused address, and then after some time you send that payment to your main stash, you effectively reveal your main stash information (number of coins, who you’ve made and received payments to, who they’ve sent and received payments to as well, and etc) to the person that paid you. Of course, blockchain analysis can reveal public addresses that receive and send payments. It can’t, however, tell ‘who’ exactly the addresses belong to <strong>unless it is already known that an associated address belongs to a certain entity </strong>(i.e. by sending funds to an exchange).</p><p>Would you want a stranger to know how much you own? Would you want an exchange to know everything you do with your personal coins not stored on their platform? Would you want any person, organization, or <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com\"><strong>company associated with blockchain data analysis firms</strong></a> to be able to mine all of your data?</p><blockquote>Last week, cryptocurrency industry giant Coinbase sparked outrage when it <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/welcoming-neutrino-to-coinbase-b3f56171850d\">announced</a> that it had purchased a small startup called Neutrino.Normally, such an acquisition wouldn’t make many waves, but Neutrino isn’t your average startup.

Let’s say you accept two 10 PART payments (20 PART total, deposited on two different unused addresses). Then, for some reason, you need to make a payment worth 15 PART AFTER receiving your two 10 PART payments. Even though both payments were received on different addresses, <strong>making a 15 PART payment would use outputs from both addresses, </strong>effectively linking them together. That’s because these addresses have less than 15 PART, so coins from both addresses need to be used.</p><p>This would effectively link both addresses since the party you send the payment to will see the funds coming from two different addresses. This is a big privacy issue (and the reason why the Coin Control feature of Particl-Qt is so powerful)!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-ZssJx1GKIGhEZio_xOdfmg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>wtokensw.com</figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>In the example above, TX 6 used outputs from both TX 4 and TX5 (two different addresses) to fund its inputs. Although both TX 4 and TX 5 were already linked together because of TX 0 and TX 2, one of the output used to send funds to TX 6 could have also come from a fictive TX 7 — an output not previously associated with any part of that chain of transactions. This would link TX 7 and TX 6 together, as well as all outputs and inputs directly or indirectly associated with TX 7 and TX 6.</blockquote><p>By using multi-wallets, you can create new wallets every time you want to accept payments or use different wallets per types or categories of transactions (i.e. a wallet to receive marketplace payments, another to receive staking rewards, another to deposit and withdraw coins from exchanges, and etc).This method of securing your privacy by isolating the wallets from each other mix really well with the privacy protocols of the PART coin. In fact, <strong>you can achieve much stronger privacy by combining RingCT/CT transactions to a solid wallet isolation strategy.</strong></p><h3 id=\"convenience-how-do-i-change-wallets\"><strong>Convenience — How Do I Change Wallets?</strong></h3><p>As with everything Particl Desktop, convenience and ease-of-use is a big focus, but there are no compromises made on the security end of things. Multi-wallets are directly in line with this approach and make switching between different wallets as easy as it can possibly be. <strong>Remember the </strong><a href=\"#009d\"><strong>tedious 9-step process for switching wallets</strong></a><strong> mentioned above? It’s been reduced to only one easy step:</strong></p><ul><li>Click on the tab of the wallet you want to use</li></ul><p>That’s right, as simple as clicking a button! Ain’t that security made easy? No need to rename or even mess with wallet.dat files, no need to restart Particl Desktop every time you want to switch wallets, and most importantly, no need to pass on benefiting from <em>security through isolation </em>because the process of doing so is too annoying! ?</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-multi-wallets-a-match-made-in-heaven\">Cold Staking &#x26; Multi-Wallets — A Match Made in Heaven</h3><p>This new multi-wallet feature is certainly a great security and privacy add-on to Particl Desktop, but its usefulness doesn’t stop there! In fact, each wallet hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance can be linked to its own cold staking key. That means you can have multiple wallets staking from different sources, with different addresses to receive (or send) your staking rewards.</p><p>Let’s say you have three different wallets and want to set your staking setup with failsafe capabilities. You could then create three cold staking node, and link each of them to a different wallet. If one node goes down, then only a part of your coins stop staking, not all of them. Even better, you could set up a node on an RPi, one on a VPS, and use the public key of a cold staking pool as your third node. This way, you would be staking from three different cold staking nodes hosted under three very different environments. This adds a bit of redundancy to your staking setup and is a failsafe measure in case an issue arises with one of the nodes.</p><p>Perhaps even more interesting, though, is the ability to better manage staking rewards. With the possibility to stake on multiple nodes within the same Particl Desktop instance, multi-wallets enable a whole range of new possibilities. What if you don’t want to keep all your staking rewards in PART? What if you only want to keep 50%, have 25% sent to an address used for trading and the other 25% as donations? What if you wanted to set multiple addresses up, each having its own purpose (i.e. spending, saving, trading, vacations, joint address with a loved one, purchases on the marketplace, health fund, and etc).</p><p>Doing exactly this has always been possible, of course. All you needed to do was to set up multiple wallets and cycle through them using the <a href=\"#009d\"><strong>tedious 9-step process</strong></a> mentioned above. But now, with multi-wallets, it’s going to be as easy, accessible, and quick as it’s ever been!</p><hr><p>Multi-wallets bring added privacy, security, and convenience to Particl Desktop and open a lot of possibilities for almost every type of users.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.
