Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nCommunity Questions\nLast week’s livestream had to be delayed for a week, so the community had quite\na few questions for Paul. Note that some of these answers have been updated with\nthe most recent news and developments that happened since the livestream.\n\nWhen can a new Particl Desktop be expected?\n\nCold staking widget is back!A new update (1.2.2) for Particl Desktop is almost\nready and should be released any day from now. Currently at the pre-release\nstage, it is going to be a big release with several bug fixes (i.e. cold staking\nwidget), stability improvements as well as a lot of new additions. Most\nimportantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and\nuser-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our\nmainnet Particl Marketplace.\n\nWe strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are\nabsolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to\ncreating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics\nalso go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building\nan online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.\n\nFor a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social\nmedia coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME]\n\nIs there any update about exchanges listing?\n\nWe are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to\nget the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very\nimportant, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl\nMarketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother\nand more seamless the experience will be.\n\nWe’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due\nto our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges,\nrather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive\nwith securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to\nexchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence\nand working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange\nfrom adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.\n\nWhat would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?\n\nDarpal Rating’s June Github Audit ReportWhile a more valuable PART coin allows\nus to do more, the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the\nPART coin. In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year,\nand may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.\n\nThe Particl Foundation website [https://particl.foundation] is the best resource\nfor most questions surrounding financials.\n\nNo matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work\nwe put into developing the Particl project.\n\nIndeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest\nvalue, Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/@DPRating], a rating agency conducting\na monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, \nranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and\nprivacy coins\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the\ndevelopment process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.\n\nThese consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120] only confirms the\nrelentlessness of the development force behind Particl.\n\nWe are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This\nfunding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take\nParticl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and\ninvest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of\nParticl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups\nusually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then\nraising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.\n\nThe primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it\nwill signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one\nwhere marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will\nbe more prevalent than they currently are.\n\nAny update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?\n\nThere is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger\nintegration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger\nso that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We\nencourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to\nintegrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing\norganic community support.\n\nNote that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is\nrecommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with\npublic transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.\n\nThere is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware\nintegration: Trezor.\n\nIs the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?\n\nWe are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not\nproduction-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time.\nWhat we’re looking into, however, is the new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj\n[https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1] that would\nallow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing\nfeasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to\ngenerate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic\nrouting protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.\n\nIs it looking at Bulletproofs?\nAs for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are\nsomething we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the\nproper research & development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain\nhasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan,\nhowever, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of\nBulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy\ntransactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of\npriorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that\nprotocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.\n\nFor more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper\nhere: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n\nAny plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?\n\nYes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything\nelse, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the\nmarketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and\nhardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop\nversion).\n\nWe also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The\nentire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the\ncommunity. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also\npossible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be\nadded to it.\n\nWill there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in\nParticl Desktop such as the marketplace?\n\nYes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is\ndone with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially\nthose in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones\ninstead. For these reasons, we strongly believe we absolutely need a mobile\nversion for the marketplace and will put the resources in place for this further\ndown the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on\nthe multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a secure \ndecentralized web interface and mobile application possible.\n\nAs we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set\nup a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this\nmobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary\nround where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest\nassured, we know we need this and will make it happen!\n\nSuch a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when\nwe said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.\n\nWhen will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?\n\nParticl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis\nblock but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the\nmessaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to\ncommunicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The\nteam is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently\nnot in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.\n\nWill there be a marketing push for RingCT?\n\nYes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based\nhardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release\nsimilarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy\nprotocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other\ncodebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be\nproperly advertised as such.\n\nWhat’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?\n\nIntegrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re\ncurrently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a\nhardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation\nfor it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance\nsystem also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource\nefficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the\nlikely strategy the team will pursue.\n\nWith that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation\nmay be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can\nbe included at the same time as the governance system.\n\nDo you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?\n\nWeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting,\nauditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code\naudit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl\nfor the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10\ncustom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that\nno major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only\nsome minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to\nreceive the fully detailed report.\n\nGraphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in\nthe Particl protocolAre Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?\n\nYes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing\nour private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress\nwhich will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system\nis going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that\nultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first\npost-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet\nexclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes\nonly.\n\nWhen will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?\n\nThe report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website. Keep an eye\nout here: http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates & Tidbits\nPaul also had a few comments and information for the community not covered by\nthe questions asked by the community.\n\nGithub\nOne of the best ways to keep updated with the development side of the Particl\nproject is to go to the source. In fact, our Github page contains a lot of\ninformation and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting\nway to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of\nour repositories.\n\nFor example, the Particl Desktop pull request tab\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls] shows a few interesting pull\nrequests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find\ninformation about multi-wallets\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], project governance\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] (community proposals), \nand more\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed].\n\nNew Status Report Published\nFor those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with\nthe Particl development news, the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/] on our website (particl.io) is the perfect\npoint of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about\nwhat is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well\nas what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!\n\nStatus ReportProject Governance (Community Proposals)\nAs you can see in both the GIF above and in the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/], we’re currently actively working on putting\ntogether the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their\nown proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not\nrepresent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they\nwere voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand,\nare proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of\nproposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be\nadopted and acted upon.\n\nFor more screenshots of the project governance user interface, click here\n[https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q], and for more information about the development of\nthis Particl Desktop feature, click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087].\n\nCommunity Fund\nIn light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there\nhas never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our\nKialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of\naround 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community,\nnot the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held\non the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the\ncommunity to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on\nParticl Desktop by creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME].\n\nFirst Anniversary\nWe celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary! In fact, Particl’s\ngenesis block was staked on the 17th of Jul 17, 2017, at 9:00:00 AM\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c]\n, and we took the opportunity to thank our supporters and recap on the progress\nmade in just a short year\n[https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95]. The best is yet\nto come!\n\nNJIT’s Academic Paper\nWe currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and\nwork on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them\nthe green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within\nacademic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime\nbefore we make it public on ours.\n\nParticl in Johannesburg\nMembers of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in\nJohannesburg, South Africa. The conference is a one-day event with a focus on\nBlockchain Technology and is in part sponsored by the Particl Foundation. Stop\nby the Particl booth to talk with team members and get Particl swag!\n\nFor more information about the schedule and to get tickets, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-on-location-at-johannesburg-blockchain-conference-july-27th-2018-7e19fa083b08\n\nDiscord\nWe will gradually be moving to Discord officially, which means it will become\nthe preferred or “default” chat platform for most of the team and chat support.\nWe will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord\ncan still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms\nwill not be focused on as much as before.\n\nWe believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its\nflexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse\nforum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience\nwith bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.\n\nMusic Channel\nOne cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music\nchannel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music\nthat anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on\nDiscord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite\nmusic with other Particl community members!\n\nParticl on Discourse\nWe are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it\nup. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it\nshould probably be resolved for next week.\n\nDemonstration of the coming Particl forumLaunching the forum will change a few\nthings around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the\nPartaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found\na few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate\nwithdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform\nwhich we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking\ninto potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We\nwill keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding\neverything forum related.\n\nOne other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be\nfor vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference\nto get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a\nproduct (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We\nstrongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow\nand the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone\nto dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.\n\nNew Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace\nWe will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl\nMarketplace. One of these goodies we want to make available are the pins\ngenerously offered to us by ICOsensei. Keep an eye out for any announcement\nregarding marketplace giveaways!\n\n—\n\nCryptoRamble Videos Since Last Community Update\n * Beginner’s Guide to Cryptocurrency 2018\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHmzVvloFFo]\n * Particl Development Update [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6IHDNw0BTQ]\n * Immigrant Data is Being Sold to ICE (WUWP#3)\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRJINSRmHSE]","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-aEYJjiffXVsGW_UnHl0LlA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Did you miss our last AMA/FAQ livestream on Youtube?

Note that some of these answers have been updated with the most recent news and developments that happened since the livestream.</p><p><strong>When can a new Particl Desktop be expected?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-HvxF1evJHXiJqO-NkfSxwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Cold staking widget is back!</figcaption></figure><p>A new update (1.2.2) for Particl Desktop is almost ready and should be released any day from now. Currently at the pre-release stage, it is going to be a big release with several bug fixes (i.e. cold staking widget), stability improvements as well as a lot of new additions. Most importantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and user-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace.</p><p>We strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are absolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to creating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics also go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building an online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">For a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social media coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.</a></p><p><strong>Is there any update about exchanges listing?</strong></p><p>We are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to get the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very important, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother and more seamless the experience will be.</p><p>We’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due to our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges, rather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive with securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to exchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence and working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange from adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.</p><p><strong>What would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-DMZNvDVsJwSGgpj57S2nqg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Darpal Rating’s June Github Audit Report</figcaption></figure><p>While a more valuable PART coin allows us to do more, <strong>the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the PART coin.</strong> In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year, and may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.</p><p>The Particl Foundation <a href=\"https://particl.foundation\">website</a> is the best resource for most questions surrounding financials.</p><p><strong>No matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work we put into developing the Particl project.</strong></p><p>Indeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest value, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\">Darpal Rating</a>, a rating agency conducting a monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, <a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\">ranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and privacy coins</a>. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the development process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.</p><p>These <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120\">consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating</a> only confirms the relentlessness of the development force behind Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>We are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This funding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take Particl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and invest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of Particl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups usually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then raising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.</p><p>The primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it will signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one where marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will be more prevalent than they currently are.</p><p><strong>Any update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?</strong></p><p>There is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger integration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger so that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We encourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to integrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing organic community support.</p><p>Note that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is recommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with public transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.</p><p>There is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware integration: Trezor.</p><p><strong>Is the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?</strong></p><p>We are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not production-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time. What we’re looking into, however, is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1\">new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj</a> that would allow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing feasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to generate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic routing protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.</p><h3 id=\"is-it-looking-at-bulletproofs\">Is it looking at Bulletproofs?</h3><p>As for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are something we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the proper research &amp; development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain hasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan, however, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of Bulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy transactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of priorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that protocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.</p><p>For more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper here: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Any plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything else, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the marketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and hardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop version).</p><p>We also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The entire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the community. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also possible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be added to it.</p><p><strong>Will there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in Particl Desktop such as the marketplace?</strong></p><p>Yes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is done with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially those in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones instead. For these reasons, we strongly believe <strong>we absolutely need a mobile version for the marketplace</strong> and will put the resources in place for this further down the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on the multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a <strong>secure </strong>decentralized web interface and mobile application possible.</p><p>As we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set up a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this mobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary round where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest assured, we know we need this and will make it happen!</p><p>Such a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when we said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.</p><p><strong>When will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?</strong></p><p>Particl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis block but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the messaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The team is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently not in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.</p><p><strong>Will there be a marketing push for RingCT?</strong></p><p>Yes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based hardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release similarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy protocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be properly advertised as such.</p><p><strong>What’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?</strong></p><p>Integrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re currently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a hardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation for it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance system also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource efficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the likely strategy the team will pursue.</p><p>With that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation may be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can be included at the same time as the governance system.</p><p><strong>Do you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?</strong></p><p>WeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting, auditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code audit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl for the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10 custom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that no major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only some minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to receive the fully detailed report.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NIKYtvnIcCCfLi2otcVl2w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Graphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in the Particl protocol</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Are Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?</strong></p><p>Yes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing our private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress which will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system is going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that ultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first post-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet exclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes only.</p><p><strong>When will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?</strong></p><p>The report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website.

Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very important, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother and more seamless the experience will be.</p><p>We’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due to our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges, rather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive with securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to exchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence and working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange from adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.</p><p><strong>What would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-DMZNvDVsJwSGgpj57S2nqg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Darpal Rating’s June Github Audit Report</figcaption></figure><p>While a more valuable PART coin allows us to do more, <strong>the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the PART coin.</strong> In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year, and may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.</p><p>The Particl Foundation <a href=\"https://particl.foundation\">website</a> is the best resource for most questions surrounding financials.</p><p><strong>No matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work we put into developing the Particl project.</strong></p><p>Indeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest value, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\">Darpal Rating</a>, a rating agency conducting a monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, <a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\">ranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and privacy coins</a>.

This funding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take Particl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and invest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of Particl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups usually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then raising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.</p><p>The primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it will signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one where marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will be more prevalent than they currently are.</p><p><strong>Any update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?</strong></p><p>There is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger integration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger so that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We encourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to integrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing organic community support.</p><p>Note that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is recommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with public transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.</p><p>There is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware integration: Trezor.</p><p><strong>Is the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?</strong></p><p>We are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not production-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time. What we’re looking into, however, is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1\">new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj</a> that would allow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing feasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to generate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic routing protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.</p><h3 id=\"is-it-looking-at-bulletproofs\">Is it looking at Bulletproofs?</h3><p>As for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are something we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the proper research &#x26; development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain hasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan, however, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of Bulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy transactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of priorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that protocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.</p><p>For more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper here: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Any plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything else, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the marketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and hardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop version).</p><p>We also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The entire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the community. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also possible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be added to it.</p><p><strong>Will there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in Particl Desktop such as the marketplace?</strong></p><p>Yes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is done with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially those in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones instead. For these reasons, we strongly believe <strong>we absolutely need a mobile version for the marketplace</strong> and will put the resources in place for this further down the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on the multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a <strong>secure </strong>decentralized web interface and mobile application possible.</p><p>As we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set up a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this mobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary round where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest assured, we know we need this and will make it happen!</p><p>Such a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when we said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.</p><p><strong>When will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?</strong></p><p>Particl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis block but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the messaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The team is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently not in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.</p><p><strong>Will there be a marketing push for RingCT?</strong></p><p>Yes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based hardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release similarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy protocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be properly advertised as such.</p><p><strong>What’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?</strong></p><p>Integrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re currently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a hardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation for it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance system also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource efficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the likely strategy the team will pursue.</p><p>With that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation may be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can be included at the same time as the governance system.</p><p><strong>Do you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?</strong></p><p>WeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting, auditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code audit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl for the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10 custom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that no major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only some minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to receive the fully detailed report.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NIKYtvnIcCCfLi2otcVl2w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Graphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in the Particl protocol</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Are Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?</strong></p><p>Yes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing our private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress which will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system is going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that ultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first post-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet exclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes only.</p><p><strong>When will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?</strong></p><p>The report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website.

In fact, our Github page contains a lot of information and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting way to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of our repositories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NMRZXp9c4-okdV3gNRN3dw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls\">Particl Desktop pull request tab</a> shows a few interesting pull requests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find information about <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096\">multi-wallets</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">project governance</a> (community proposals), <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">and more</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published\">New Status Report Published</h3><p>For those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with the Particl development news, the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a> on our website (particl.io) is the perfect point of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about what is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well as what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NFoIFPJqgKElhAPMWReMiA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Status Report</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"project-governance-community-proposals-\">Project Governance (Community Proposals)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-3UqZHLKP-rRwh8VI8lvCeg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As you can see in both the GIF above and in the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a>, we’re currently actively working on putting together the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their own proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not represent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they were voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand, are proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of proposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be adopted and acted upon.</p><p>For more screenshots of the project governance user interface, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q\">click here</a>, and for more information about the development of this Particl Desktop feature, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">click here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h3><p>In light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there has never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our Kialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of around 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community, not the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held on the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the community to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on Particl Desktop by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread</a>.</p><h3 id=\"first-anniversary\">First Anniversary</h3><p>We celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary! In fact, Particl’s genesis block was <a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c\">staked on the 17th of Jul 17, 2017, at 9:00:00 AM</a>, and we took the opportunity to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95\">thank our supporters and recap on the progress made in just a short year</a>. The best is yet to come!</p><h3 id=\"njit-s-academic-paper\">NJIT’s Academic Paper</h3><p>We currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and work on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them the green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within academic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime before we make it public on ours.</p><h3 id=\"particl-in-johannesburg\">Particl in Johannesburg</h3><p>Members of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in Johannesburg, South Africa. The conference is a one-day event with a focus on Blockchain Technology and is in part sponsored by the Particl Foundation.

We will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord can still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms will not be focused on as much as before.</p><p>We believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its flexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse forum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience with bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.</p><h3 id=\"music-channel\">Music Channel</h3><p>One cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music channel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music that anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on Discord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite music with other Particl community members!</p><h3 id=\"particl-on-discourse\">Particl on Discourse</h3><p>We are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it up. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it should probably be resolved for next week.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-cBKLFANfZQHq8Ij8yMgDTg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Demonstration of the coming Particl forum</figcaption></figure><p>Launching the forum will change a few things around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the Partaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found a few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate withdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform which we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking into potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We will keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding everything forum related.</p><p>One other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be for vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference to get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a product (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We strongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow and the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone to dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.</p><h3 id=\"new-merch-available-for-free-on-particl-marketplace\">New Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace</h3><p>We will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl Marketplace.

Nakamoto and their “magic internet money”?\n\n| btw, Particl mentioned in there ;)That naivety to understanding technology is\na double-edged sword in the decentralized ecosystem because fancy marketing and\n30 minutes spent writing an ERC20 contract can generate a lot of buzz (and\nmoney) around magical solutions to everyday problems.\n\nThe question becomes, when does the tech make sense and when doesn’t it?\n\nEnable Privacy\nSetting out to create a platform for privacy-focused decentralized applications\nis not a challenge for the faint of heart. In fact, among the thousands of\ncryptocurrency projects in existence, Particl is still one of the only\nopen-source platform being developed with privacy in its DNA.\n\nPrivacy is a well-discussed topic in blockchain solutions but 99% of the time it\nis merely an afterthought or even by product when building on a decentralized\nnetwork. Particl is private by design which makes everything our team develops\nmultiple times harder to achieve and is why no other project is comparable when\nlooking at the full breadth of products and features Particl already offers\nafter 1 year.\n\nWhenever shareholders are involved and need to be kept happy, privacy becomes a\nmarketing buzz word that is attached to data collection tools in fancy ways like \n“Personal Recommendations”, “Shoppers Also Liked”, “Your friends are talking\nabout…”, “You parked here…”.\n\nUser data is a powerful metric all companies use to their advantage in order to\nmaximize profits. A good marketing team will package it within a “privacy”\nwrapper to make users feel safe and cozy like warm alpaca socks, while the\npersonal information people willingly provide helps giant internet companies\nbuild better tools to appease shareholders and make the most money possible.\n\nThere is a case for privacy-focused decentralized applications in the tech\nindustry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nand, at one year young, Particl is one of the only project building an\nopen-source privacy platform that is truly private by design.\n\nOrigination & Innovation\nParticl Core [https://github.com/particl/particl-core] is the backbone of the\nproject and is the source for a number of privacy enhancements to the underlying\nBitcoin codebase this past year. All revolve around privacy and security and are\nindustry pioneering innovations:\n\n * Confidential Transactions (CT)\n * Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)\n * Particl Proof of Stake (PPoS) with Cold Staking\n * Secure Message (SMSG)\n\nParticl Core has averaged a new release every 3 weeks (20 releases) this year. A\nvery impressive development pace, wouldn’t you agree? And these aren’t trivial\ncode commits; many are industry firsts as you can see by the list above.\n\nMuch of this credit goes to our Lead Core Developer, Tecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert], and his team. Besides researching and\nimplementing intense cryptographic standards into Particl, they are also staying\ncurrent with Bitcoin Core development.\n\nBitcoin developers have updated Bitcoin’s codebase 5\n[https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history]* times since the launch of Particl\n(0.14.2). Our team merged those changes every time, after a proper testing\nperiod had passed and the code was ready for Particl mainnet.\n\n> Bitcoin code commits alone (nearly 5000) account for 1,185 changed files with \n124,688 additions and 56,438 deletions.\n * Bitcoin Core 0.16.1 (18.06.15) | Particl Core 0.16.1.0 (18 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 (18.02.26) | Particl Core 0.16.0.1 (28 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.1 (17.11.11) | Particl Core 0.15.1 (6 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 (17.09.19) | Particl Core 0.15.0.2 (10 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 (17.09.14) | Merged with above (15 days later)\n\nNeedless to say, copy-pasta [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta] project\nteams don’t care about this level of security or compatibility with Bitcoin and\n99.9% of projects can’t make the above claim over the past year.\n\n*Bitcoin Core 0.16.2 is already in the pipeline: 0.16.2rc2\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.16.2rc2] | Particl Core is\nstaying in step: master_btc\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/bd0445c306e0aa0a4bc13023b6149f3d00d65fca]\n\nParticl Roadmap\nWe released our current roadmap\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-roadmap-update-891d898ad47b] in March\nand the progress of development can be seen on our website\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/].\n\nIf you watch our AMA livestreams every couple weeks you hopefully caught our\nlast one with Ryno joining me to talk development and the marketplace\n[https://youtu.be/Xtmc2qCWmvc]. He mentioned in that episode we would be looking\nat our scrum/sprint platform plan to see if we can open the scheduling and\nprogress wireframes up to public viewing in an effort to be more transparent.\nThat will be something to keep an eye out for for those who want to get more\ndetails on Particl R&D.\n\nAll our roadmap items are highly anticipatory because they directly tie to\nfuture products on Particl’s first-of-its-kind privacy platform. One item that\nis personally exciting to me is the Particl Open Market Protocol (OMP) that \nKewde [https://github.com/kewde] is working on. A library\n[https://github.com/particl/omp-lib] for the OMP has begun on Github that is\ntied to the Software Development Kit (SDK)\n\nParticl Network\nParticl is a testing environment by nature and all of our development is open\nsource and runs through multiple levels of testing and refinement. We don’t\nclose source our Desktop [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop] GUI or our \nMarket [https://github.com/particl/particl-market] backend. Every piece of our\nprivacy platform is out in the open.\n\nParticl has maintained 2 active and functioning blockchains since our mainnet\ngenesis block was generated; which all our products and applications run on in\nvarious level of development and deployment. Our Mainnet chain is what most\npeople use to send and receive PART. Our Testnet chain is our research and\ndevelopment environment where new privacy features and security technology is\ncreated.\n\nMainnet\nThe first and only live version of Confidential Transactions (CT) on a Bitcoin\nbased blockchain has been on Particl’s mainnet since launch day 1 last year. We\nalso have the first and only cold storage staking protocol\n[https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac] on the main\nchain — no matter what others may say\n[https://www.coindesk.com/a-3-3-billion-claim-has-cardanos-blockchain-solved-proof-of-stake/] \n?.\n\nParticl was one of the first projects to have Native Segwit as well, meaning,\nevery transaction on Particl is a fast, low-cost, Segwit transaction.\n\nSecure Messages can be sent using our cli/Qt Core wallet builds\n[http://particl.io/downloads/]. Particl Copay and Particl Desktop are 2 more\nofficial mobile and desktop clients (respectively) running on mainnet.\n\n> We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that\nworks. — Douglas Adams\nParticl Desktop\nI find this quote fitting for our flagship client, Particl Desktop. Mainstream\nadoption for cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications isn’t going to come\ndown to how much is “under the hood”. Ultimately, widespread adoption will come\ndown to how easy this or that is to use. There is no denying the level of care\nthe CRZ [https://github.com/gerlofvanek] and xludx [https://github.com/xludx] \nlead teams have placed on usability, design and simplicity within the entire\nline of Particl products/apps.\n\nMost crypto project teams can create pretty pictures of what they plan to make\nand what they want to deliver, but very, very few can actually show you a well\ndesigned working app or even prototype until they’ve cycled through 12 to 24\nmonths of funding.\n\nDesktop is one example of what Particl developers roadmap to build\n\nHere is what the Particl team delivered\n\nTestnet\nParticl testnet currently has the only working version of RingCT\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] on a Bitcoin based codebase in\nexistence. This is a really big deal, even bigger than Particl also having the\nonly version of CT live on mainnet. RingCT is a very intense and complex privacy\nenhancement the Particl team implemented on our codebase and, as such, we went\nto great lengths to properly review and audit our design. Read more about the\nstatus of those reports further down the article.\n\nParticl Marketplace (ALPHA)\nOf course the biggest news for Particl this year has been the release of our MVP\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, Particl Marketplace. Our Alpha version of the marketplace is live on our\ntestnet. We have an active community of testers debugging it and our team is\noccasionally placing real Particl swag on the decentralized marketplace for\nusers to get a real experience of the early buying process the private\nmarketplace will offer; including our 2-party trustless escrow (MAD) protocol.\n\n> \nAlpha is a privacy-focused decentralized shopping app within Particl Desktop.\nUsers can download a testnet only version of Desktop that comes with Alpha\nMarketplace pre-loaded.\n\nRate of Coin Supply Reduced\nThe days of PART coin supply increasing 5% over the first year are now over.\nToday at 2018–07–17 13:00:00 the inflation rate of PART coin supply decreased\n1%. By design, this inflation model is coded to move from 5% the first year to\n2% the fourth year and every year thereafter.\n\nThe nodes working on the Particl network providing consensus will now receive a\n4% coinstake reward for the next year.\n\nThe historic first 4% block staked: \nhttps://explorer.particl.io/block/cc50daf0bee9e64d413a17df4b19046715c5f389b1a881c6976960c1dc615f84\n\nAudits and Peer Reviews\nDPRating [https://medium.com/u/b9f607dd798]\n\nDarpal Ratings is a blockchain auditing company focused on the digital currency\nsector.

Per our last Community Update, we have a 6 month grant\nestablished with NJIT for a RingCT peer review that just completed. We also\nhired WSA to perform a RingCT code audit that is only about 2 weeks of work.\n\nNJIT Peer Review\nOur team has a copy of Professor Qiang’s paper on Particl’s Ring Confidential\nTransactions and are reviewing it in-house and with his research team.\nUltimately Prof. Qiang has asked if they can submit the paper as an academic\nresearch paper for review among trade publications and peers. The team would\nfully support a submission after proper dialog between both teams is completed.\n\nWSA Code Audit\nA couple weeks ago we engaged WSA for a RingCT code audit. Ryno\n[https://github.com/rynomster] got word that the review is done and only 4 minor\nissues were found, nothing major or critical! The WSA team hinted that the\nreport would be delivered this week so we’ll keep everyone in the loop.\n\nClosing Remarks\n> The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the\nart. — John Lasseter\nThis quote rings true for every Pixar or Disney movie ever made. It’s easy to\nsee beauty at the end of a project and it takes a trained eye to see it during\nthe product’s lifecycle.\n\nParticl isn’t out to unseed Bitcoin as the one and only digital currency or\nAmazon as the only place to buy stuff online. The team has deep roots in\nprivacy, security and technology and we are building a decentralized\nalternative — a choice — that has these roots deeply embedded in its DNA.\n\nLeveraging technology to build privacy-focused decentralized applications sparks\nall our team to make products that are simple, clean and enjoyable to use. We’ve\nonly been at this for 1 year but the results so far have shown us that the tech\ndoes make sense for our privacy platform and the tools we’re creating are easy\nto use and understand — leading to future mainstream adoption.\n\nThis is a look back at our first year.\n\nHappy Anniversary to all our Community!\nParticl Team","html":"<h3 id=\"a-look-back-at-our-first-year\">A look back at our first year</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Genesis-Anniversary/1-U5NuuvWi9PFopEZ4lRfILg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>On <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-launch-update-july-17th-2017-15ec6d4fd6a8\">July 17th</a>, 2017, one year ago today, Particl main network (mainnet) genesis block was <a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c\">generated</a>, becoming one of the only pure Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies not starting with an initial mining period —<strong> truly a rare breed</strong>.</p><p>We created a nice round-up of what Particl accomplished in 2017 within our end-of-year <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797\">review</a> January 1st.

Per our last Community Update, we have a 6 month grant established with NJIT for a RingCT peer review that just completed. We also hired WSA to perform a RingCT code audit that is only about 2 weeks of work.</p><h3 id=\"njit-peer-review\">NJIT Peer Review</h3><p>Our team has a copy of Professor Qiang’s paper on Particl’s Ring Confidential Transactions and are reviewing it in-house and with his research team. Ultimately Prof. Qiang has asked if they can submit the paper as an academic research paper for review among trade publications and peers. The team would fully support a submission after proper dialog between both teams is completed.</p><h3 id=\"wsa-code-audit\">WSA Code Audit</h3><p>A couple weeks ago we engaged WSA for a RingCT code audit. <a href=\"https://github.com/rynomster\">Ryno</a> got word that the review is done and only 4 minor issues were found, nothing major or critical! The WSA team hinted that the report would be delivered this week so we’ll keep everyone in the loop.</p><h2 id=\"closing-remarks\">Closing Remarks</h2><blockquote>The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the art. — John Lasseter</blockquote><p>This quote rings true for every Pixar or Disney movie ever made.

The team has deep roots in privacy, security and technology and we are building a decentralized alternative — a choice — that has these roots deeply embedded in its DNA.</p><p>Leveraging technology to build privacy-focused decentralized applications sparks all our team to make products that are simple, clean and enjoyable to use.

We’ve got your back with our\nbi-weekly community and project update!\n\nThanks to our community member CryptoBeans for preparing most of the notes for\nthis update!\n\nLivestream Summary\nTeam Meetings\nTaking a break at the end of the day!Most of the core Particl developers met in\nPrague during the last week of June for a series of project meetings focused on\nthe planning and development of the roadmap items for the second half of the\nyear and moving forward. A particular focus was put on both the project and\nmarketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet\nfeature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed\nduring that time.\n\nTo conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer,\njoined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as\nan update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from\nthe community.\n\nProject & Marketplace Governance\nRyno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going\nto be integrated into the platform.\n\n * The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the\n   marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.\n * The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin\n   with and will evolve with time.\n * Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the\n   wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.\n * The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting\n   as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much\n   smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.\n * When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by\n   the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients\n   connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.\n * Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing\n   is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is\n   blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the\n   blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s\n   side.\n * When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the\n   vendor.\n * Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not\n   necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be.\n   The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the\n   governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace\n   governance model is planned for the Beta.\n * Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that\n   users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same\n   listing again.\n\nRingCT\nThere have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under\nacademic review for the last 6 months by assistant-professor Qiang Tang from\nthe\nNJIT Department of Technology [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/].\n\n * The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy\n   protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.\n * Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in\n   possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will\n   soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be\n   made available at that point.\n * The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their\n   research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nWeSecureApp * The WSA Cyber Group [https://wesecureapp.com/#] will then perform a full\n   RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the\n   RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require\n   around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline,\n   only a rough estimate.\n * While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &\n   CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet\n   implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not\n   only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still\n   very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe\n   there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be\n   considered safe enough for our users.\n\nMarketplace\nAs the Particl Marketplace Alpha\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] is still being improved\nand tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as\nwell as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.\n\n * Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion\n   on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be\n   added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the\n   messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to\n   store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli\n   but is not available in a graphical interface.\n * As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make\n   available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the designs from\n   our t-shirt contest winners\n   [https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5], to the\n   Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!\n * Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden\n   marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into\n   Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the\n   marketplace.\n * The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern\n   private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into\n   the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire\n   marketplaces (TBC).\n\nParticl Foundation\nDuring the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a\nParticl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course\nattended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions\nrelated to the Foundation.\n\n * The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second\n   or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the Particl\n   Foundation website [http://particl.foundation/financial-reports].\n * The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is\n   planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in\n   September 2018.\n\nLedger\nAs part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger\nwallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as\nwell as some other coins.\n\n * It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART,\n   however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for\n   advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s\n   interface.\n * Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.\n   [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482] \n   The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.\n * The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public\n   transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is\n   part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.\n\nOther Questions Asked During the Livestream\nThere are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community\nto both Ryno and Paul.\n\nRyno answering some of the Particl community questions * When asked where he\n   sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the\n   marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to\n   developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of\n   users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the\n   marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly\n   communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized\n   eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number,\n   talent, and experience.\n * When asked about other\n   dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is\n   in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated\n   about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally\n   enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny\n   auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.\n * Within the Particl\n   community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish\n   list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good\n   ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps,\n   gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (with one streaming dApp\n   allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member\n   [https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA]), and etc. One thing is for sure; the\n   idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to\n   dramatically improve several industries.\n * Ryno was asked about\n   the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of\n   the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts\n   of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as\n   the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is\n   now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl\n   developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile\n   methodologies are now also being put into practice, and two new development\n   managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired\n   [https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5]. It\n   was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for\n   issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are\n   now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s status\n   reports [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nBi-Weekly Recap\nThere is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have\nbeen quite eventful for the project.\n\nParticl Team is Expanding\nOn the 27th of June, we introduced 6 new team members\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5] \nincluding three managers and three developers. Carmen and Vivienne, our two new\ndevelopment managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our\norganizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new\ndevelopers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to\nspeed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!\n\nDuring last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer\nfor Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year.\nThis developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included\nin the 6 new team members blog post.\n\nPartaker Hub\nTop 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.The Partaker\nHub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of\ncontributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub\nis now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that it\nwas\nlaunched only three weeks ago\n[https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4].\n\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in\nspreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout\nto encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of\n146 tasks.\n\nDuring these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience\nfor all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and\nexperimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl\nmessage through organic word-of-mouth.\n\nAs such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be\nlinked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that\nusing and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the\nresults of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our\ncommunity to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more\ndetails about these new developments should be coming out soon.\n\nCommunity Meetup\nFollowing the week of meetings, the Particl team held a meetup\n[https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de] for\ncommunity members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks.\nThe meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague\nthat only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of\nour fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts)\nfrom TShirtPrinting [http://tshirtprinting.gr/], a long-time supporter of the\nproject, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and\noffering them as gifts!\n\nNew Particl Core Update\nYesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version\n(0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of\nalways staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase\nand is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience\nfor our users.\n\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will,\nhowever, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or\nParticl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core\nbut will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update\ncan be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract.\nNot updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but\nit is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl\nCore for security and stability reasons.\n\nNote that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will\nautomatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a\nversion before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.\n\nNew Official Blog Posts\nThere has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two\nweeks!\n\n * First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!\n   [https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441]\n * Particl welcomes 6 new team members!\n   [https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5]\n * Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub\n   [https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66]\n * PART now available for swapping on Mycelium\n   [https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a]\n * RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0\n   [https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515]\n\nNew CryptoRamble Videos\nDesi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only\nParticl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

A particular focus was put on both the project and marketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet feature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed during that time.</p><p>To conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer, joined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as an update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from the community.</p><h3 id=\"project-marketplace-governance\">Project &amp; Marketplace Governance</h3><p>Ryno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going to be integrated into the platform.</p><ul><li>The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the marketplace and the project.

Downgrading to a version before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.</p><h3 id=\"new-official-blog-posts\">New Official Blog Posts</h3><p>There has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two weeks!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441\">First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">Particl welcomes 6 new team members!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66\">Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a\">PART now available for swapping on Mycelium</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515\">RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"new-cryptoramble-videos\">New CryptoRamble Videos</h3><p>Desi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only Particl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

A particular focus was put on both the project and marketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet feature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed during that time.</p><p>To conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer, joined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as an update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from the community.</p><h3 id=\"project-marketplace-governance\">Project &#x26; Marketplace Governance</h3><p>Ryno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going to be integrated into the platform.</p><ul><li>The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.</li><li>The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin with and will evolve with time.</li><li>Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.</li><li>The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.</li><li>When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.</li><li>Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s side.</li><li>When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the vendor.</li><li>Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be. The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace governance model is planned for the Beta.</li><li>Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same listing again.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ringct\">RingCT</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-QeptxWMrevjZX2HigZVhhg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>There have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under academic review for the last 6 months by <a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/\">assistant-professor Qiang Tang from the NJIT Department of Technology</a>.</p><ul><li>The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.</li><li>Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be made available at that point.</li><li>The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-2AsxZ8uoxIj2CWNRb_p_Fw@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>WeSecureApp</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://wesecureapp.com/#\">WSA Cyber Group</a> will then perform a full RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline, only a rough estimate.</li><li>While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &#x26; CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be considered safe enough for our users.</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace\">Marketplace</h3><p>As the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Particl Marketplace Alpha</a> is still being improved and tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as well as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.</p><ul><li>Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli but is not available in a graphical interface.</li><li>As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5\">designs from our t-shirt contest winners</a>, to the Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!</li><li>Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the marketplace.</li><li>The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire marketplaces (TBC).</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-foundation\">Particl Foundation</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>During the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a Particl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course attended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions related to the Foundation.</p><ul><li>The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the <a href=\"http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\">Particl Foundation website</a>.</li><li>The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in September 2018.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ledger\">Ledger</h3><p>As part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger wallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as well as some other coins.</p><ul><li>It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART, however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s interface.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482\">Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.</a> The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.</li><li>The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.</li></ul><h3 id=\"other-questions-asked-during-the-livestream\">Other Questions Asked During the Livestream</h3><p>There are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community to both Ryno and Paul.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-rvUyAEMi_0RTxb8o3jg08g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Ryno answering some of the Particl community questions</figcaption></figure><ul><li>When asked where he sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number, talent, and experience.</li><li>When asked about other dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.</li><li>Within the Particl community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps, gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (<a href=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA\">with one streaming dApp allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member</a>), and etc. One thing is for sure; the idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to dramatically improve several industries.</li><li>Ryno was asked about the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile methodologies are now also being put into practice, and <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">two new development managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired</a>. It was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">status reports</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=\"bi-weekly-recap\">Bi-Weekly Recap</h2><p>There is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have been quite eventful for the project.</p><h3 id=\"particl-team-is-expanding\">Particl Team is Expanding</h3><p>On the 27th of June, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">we introduced 6 new team members</a> including three managers and three developers. Carmen and Vivienne, our two new development managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our organizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new developers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to speed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!</p><p>During last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer for Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year. This developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included in the 6 new team members blog post.</p><h3 id=\"partaker-hub\">Partaker Hub</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-hk3ogNBwA1tDap_t2WDTDw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Top 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.</figcaption></figure><p>The Partaker Hub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of contributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub is now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4\">it was launched only three weeks ago</a>.</p><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in spreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout to encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of 146 tasks.</p><p>During these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience for all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and experimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl message through organic word-of-mouth.</p><p>As such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be linked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that using and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the results of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our community to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more details about these new developments should be coming out soon.</p><h3 id=\"community-meetup\">Community Meetup</h3><p>Following the week of meetings, the Particl team <a href=\"https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de\">held a meetup</a> for community members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks. The meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague that only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of our fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts) from <a href=\"http://tshirtprinting.gr/\">TShirtPrinting</a>, a long-time supporter of the project, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and offering them as gifts!</p><h3 id=\"new-particl-core-update\">New Particl Core Update</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-Z9ugBVnUoCv5Uo-7z4xHiw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Yesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version (0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of always staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase and is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience for our users.</p><p>If you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will, however, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or Particl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core but will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update can be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract. Not updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but it is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl Core for security and stability reasons.</p><p>Note that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will automatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a version before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.</p><h3 id=\"new-official-blog-posts\">New Official Blog Posts</h3><p>There has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two weeks!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441\">First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">Particl welcomes 6 new team members!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66\">Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a\">PART now available for swapping on Mycelium</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515\">RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"new-cryptoramble-videos\">New CryptoRamble Videos</h3><p>Desi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only Particl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

doorsteps around the\nglobe!\n\nAnd we’re beginning to see some of the first Marketplace Alpha products get\ndelivered!\n\nEarlier in June we started a special promotion to get users testing our \ndecentralized marketplace\n[https://particl.news/week-in-review-official-particl-swag-being-purchased-on-alpha-market-testnet-9bbf8c96d383]\n.\n\nIf you were part of that group then keep an eye for your official Particl swag\nin your post.\n\nBuying real products in a testing environment\nNaturally a product like Particl Marketplace, in its early testing phases, on\nthe test network, using test PART coins would populate with a bunch of\ntest/pretend listings for test/pretend products, etc. It’s essential to test all\npossible parameters vendors and customers might encounter when using the\ndecentralized marketplace.\n\nWe are getting even faster and more accurate metrics with actually offering real\nproducts in this environment.\n\nReal products like our Particl t-shirts placed for sale have an inherent mission\nin life — to be paid for, contracted in escrow, mailed out and delivered. Test\nlistings with pretend items are merely posers that can mask vital steps in our\neCommerce checkout process because real results (shipments) aren’t expected.\n\nWaiting on your order?\nSo our first batch of shirts has gone out and with those orders a bunch of\nvaluable issues have been logged to help boost the shopping experience on\nParticl Marketplace. Thank you!\n\nWe are going to re-open the official Particl storefront and shirt listings this\nweek and begin taking some new orders. If you have an order in and it is still\nshowing “Bidding” you’ll want to make a new order when we give the go ahead in\nour social channels.\n\nCurrent Inventory\nOur first batch of branded tees are going fast but we’ll be giving away shirts\nthroughout the testing phase of the Marketplace, so no worries if you don’t make\nthe first round. Alpha doesn’t provide timestamps for orders nor does it give\nthe option to remove past items bid on but not accepted. Have patience, these\nare free giveaways for testers, you’ll love them when you get them!\n\nWe have new Particl emblem pins!\nA special shout out goes to a vendor who goes by ICOsensei on Twitter.\n\n> \nWe received a shipment of 50 Particl branded lapel pins from ICOsensei\n[https://twitter.com/ICO_sensei] last week and we have permission to offer these\nas products on the Alpha Marketplace.\n\nThese are really well made pins for all cryptocurrency collectors out there.\n\nMore Vendors\nIt’s cool getting free stuff right? Have a favorite coin that gives away shirts,\nstickers, coffee mugs? Give them a shout out, share a link to our Particl\nDesktop with Alpha Marketplace on testnet and put them in contact with the team.\n\nGoing halfsies with real products like ICOsensei’s lapel pins (which they paid\nfor inventory and we pay for shipping) helps promote the project and marketplace\nand also helps us find better experiences in our shopping dapp we’re building.\n\nHow cool would it be to buy some of your favorite coin project shirts like PIVX,\nKomodo, Decred on the Particl Marketplace with test-PART? Remember that our\nvision for the Marketplace is that it’s a use case for these projects and many,\nmany more.

The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to\nbuild trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly\nprivate?\n\nOne of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with\nwhom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than\nthey ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get\nour data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have\nspecifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable\npractices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make\nmoney out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the\nvery people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit\nthe servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to\nanother company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard\nto keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for\nwhat purpose.\n\nWhy Does It Even Matter?\n“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically\ncommodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users\nfrom whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified\nabout it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for\nfree while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads? Nothing is\nfree on the internet, companies exist for the sole purpose of making profits and\nhuge websites have huge maintenance costs. When a platform appears as free, it\nis most likely because you are making “personal data payments”.\n\n * “Data is the new oil” — Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC\n   Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of Move Fast and Break Things: How\n   Google, Facebook, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\n\nOn one hand, this “data economy” is good for partner companies that can then\nmake their products and platforms arguably better for their users. The ability\nfor them to know who exactly is using their platform allows them to make a much\nmore customized and personal experience. But on the other hand, things can get\nugly quickly.\n\nMaking money off your back\nThe most common and recurring concern from the public when it comes to personal\ndata sharing is the fact that companies are making millions if not billions\nreselling every single detail of our private lives to whoever is willing to pay\nfor it. Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken\nfrom, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where\nit is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly\nkept in the dark even though it affects them directly.\n\nNo consent\nAs it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what\nhappens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares\nit with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their\npersonal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly\naffect anybody is with the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal. In that particular\nscenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data\nanalytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the\nRepublican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words,\nevery Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their\npolitical rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so\nunwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has\ngone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude\nreality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you,\nwith or without your consent or knowledge.\n\nIn the wrong hands\nWhen you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only\ntrust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it\nsecure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very\nvaluable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the\nexponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal\ndata as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit\ncard numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals\nconstantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of\nthumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from\nits users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that\nyou are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain\ncontinuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being\nbreached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other\ncompanies.\n\nKeeping your private life private\nOne of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact\nthat privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice\nto keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like\nit. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality\nservice without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.\n\n> “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing\nto hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you\nhave nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden\nThe GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?\nA couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when\nthe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into\neffect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses\nthe sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give\ncontrol to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified\nand stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies\nclearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they\nwill do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as\nto how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it\nsecure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the\nprotection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.\n\nDo we really have a choice?\nIn the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the\nnew terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new\nterms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In\nsome cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative\nservices that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an\nundertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users\ncould lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even\ncontact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to\naccept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece\nof software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are\nnow owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or\nApple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their\nwide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a\nrather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior\nuser-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people\nwill accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information\nto the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.\n\nYou still need to trust them!\nSecondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or\nincompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should\nthey misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will\nnever happen, as was evidenced by the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal in which Facebook\nseemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal\ndata. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get\nhacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their\nterms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data\ntheft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of\nregulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases,\nsucceed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.\n\nThe Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers\nIn the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an\nopportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only\nvery recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new\ntechnologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous\nsection, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the\ncompany behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your\npersonal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the\nneed to trust a third-party? There actually is!\n\nBlockchain technology allows two or more users to directly exchange data without\nthe use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular\nuse-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as\nBitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached\nto it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone\nin the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a\npayment processor or a company.\n\nHowever, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual\ncurrencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be\nused to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called\ndecentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with\neach other without any third-party or company running the software. It is\npossible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could\nbuy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company\nlike Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but\ntaken a step further.\n\nIs Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?\nYes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the\nworld in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some\ndrawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are \npublic and permanent data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever\nbe publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain\ntechnology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is\nnot. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while\ntransactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to\ncryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user\nidentities can be revealed.\n\nThe case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being\nstored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain\nanalysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and\ngovernmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on\ntracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s\nDepartment of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense\n(military) contractor, in as early as 2016\n(https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/).\nThis, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly\nvisible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public\ntransactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or\npresent analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really\nwant our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone\ninterested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become\npowerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain\nsomeone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech\ngiant like Amazon.\n\nTaking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level\nThe blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly\nshare data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in\nterms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and\nmade private-by-design, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved\nif combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?\n\nPrivacy-focused blockchains are good…\nThe first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers\nuntraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data\ntransactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and\ngroundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where\ntransactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts,\nparticipants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and\nzero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles.\nNote that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency\ntransactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.\n\nPrivate-by-design blockchains are even better!\nTo be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be\nmandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an\nopt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having\nopt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made,\nthus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more\nsuspect.\n\nNot everything needs to be stored on-chain\nBlockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s\nnot ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound\nfiles, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in\nthere permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the\nentire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage\nboth a scaling and security nightmare.\n\nIt is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that\nuse the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their\naccompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that\nthese P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not\nentirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of\na decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized\nstorage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It\ncould then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and\nbe configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after\npre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the\n“amnesic” properties.\n\nIt’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!\nAnother security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to\nprotecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact,\nmost blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed\nconnection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers,\nmaking it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection\ninformation.\n\nAgain, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing\nbecomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a\nsmall portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking\nsuspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re\nstronger”!\n\nThe Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality\nWith the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable\noption, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application\nplatform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy\nparameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves\nquite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any\ncurrency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS,\nBlockstack, etc).\n\nThe project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design\ndecentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services,\nand is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized\napplications very user-friendly. The project is built on the foundation of\nprivacy and security, and as such is having its breakthrough privacy protocol\n(RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase) reviewed for any flaw by the NJIT Department of\nTechnology.\n\nParticl aims at decentralizing popular web services as well as the\ncryptocurrency ecosystem and making them private-by-default, heralding a new,\nsecure, private and trust-less way for people to use the internet while keeping\ntheir private life provably private.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Case-for-Privacy-in-the-Tech-Industry/1-kjhAZ5nvH9SnqAZGsTCyrQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data.

One of the main reason why that is is that they have specifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable practices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make money out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the very people being affected by such actions.

The best example to illustrate how this can directly affect anybody is with the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal. In that particular scenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data analytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the Republican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words, every Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their political rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so unwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has gone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude reality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you, with or without your consent or knowledge.</p><h3 id=\"in-the-wrong-hands\"><strong>In the wrong hands</strong></h3><p>When you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only trust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it secure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very valuable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the exponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal data as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit card numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals constantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of thumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from its users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that you are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain continuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being breached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other companies.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-your-private-life-private\"><strong>Keeping your private life private</strong></h3><p>One of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact that privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice to keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like it. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality service without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.</p><blockquote>“Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-gdpr-a-step-in-the-good-direction-but-is-it-enough\">The GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?</h2><p>A couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into effect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses the sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified and stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies clearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they will do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as to how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it secure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the protection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-really-have-a-choice\"><strong>Do we really have a choice?</strong></h3><p>In the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the new terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new terms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In some cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative services that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an undertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users could lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even contact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to accept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece of software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are now owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their wide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a rather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior user-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people will accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information to the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.</p><h3 id=\"you-still-need-to-trust-them-\"><strong>You still need to trust them!</strong></h3><p>Secondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or incompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should they misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will never happen, as was evidenced by the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal in which Facebook seemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal data. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get hacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their terms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data theft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of regulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases, succeed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.</p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-do-away-with-trusting-strangers\">The Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers</h3><p>In the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an opportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only very recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new technologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous section, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the company behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your personal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the need to trust a third-party? There actually is!</p><p><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> allows two or more users to directly exchange data without the use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular use-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached to it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone in the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a payment processor or a company.</p><p>However, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual currencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be used to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called decentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with each other without any third-party or company running the software. It is possible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could buy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company like Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data.

This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses the sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified and stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies clearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they will do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as to how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it secure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the protection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-really-have-a-choice\"><strong>Do we really have a choice?</strong></h3><p>In the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the new terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new terms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In some cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative services that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an undertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users could lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even contact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to accept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece of software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are now owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their wide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a rather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior user-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people will accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information to the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.</p><h3 id=\"you-still-need-to-trust-them-\"><strong>You still need to trust them!</strong></h3><p>Secondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or incompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should they misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will never happen, as was evidenced by the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal in which Facebook seemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal data. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get hacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their terms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data theft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of regulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases, succeed) to get your data.

Digital privacy and data security have only very recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new technologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous section, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the company behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your personal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the need to trust a third-party? There actually is!</p><p><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> allows two or more users to directly exchange data without the use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular use-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached to it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone in the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a payment processor or a company.</p><p>However, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual currencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be used to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called decentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with each other without any third-party or company running the software. It is possible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could buy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company like Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but taken a step further.</p><h2 id=\"is-blockchain-technology-really-better-at-keeping-your-private-data-private\">Is Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?</h2><p>Yes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the world in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some drawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are <strong>public</strong> and <strong>permanent</strong> data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever be publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain technology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is not. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while transactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to cryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user identities can be revealed.</p><p>The case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being stored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain analysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and governmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on tracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s Department of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense (military) contractor, in as early as 2016 (https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/). This, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly visible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public transactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or present analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really want our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone interested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become powerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain someone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech giant like Amazon.</p><h2 id=\"taking-blockchain-technologies-to-the-next-level\">Taking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level</h2><p>The blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly share data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in terms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and made <strong>private-by-design</strong>, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved if combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?</p><h3 id=\"privacy-focused-blockchains-are-good-\"><strong>Privacy-focused blockchains are good…</strong></h3><p>The first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers untraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data transactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and groundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where transactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts, participants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and zero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles. Note that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency transactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"private-by-design-blockchains-are-even-better-\"><strong>Private-by-design blockchains are even better!</strong></h3><p>To be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be mandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an opt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having opt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made, thus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more suspect.</p><h3 id=\"not-everything-needs-to-be-stored-on-chain\"><strong>Not everything needs to be stored on-chain</strong></h3><p>Blockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s not ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound files, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in there permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the entire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage both a scaling and security nightmare.</p><p>It is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that use the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their accompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that these P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not entirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of a decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized storage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It could then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and be configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after pre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the “amnesic” properties.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-not-only-about-transactions-and-uploaded-data-\"><strong>It’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!</strong></h3><p>Another security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to protecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact, most blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed connection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers, making it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection information.</p><p>Again, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing becomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a small portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking suspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re stronger”!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-project-is-making-that-vision-a-reality\">The Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality</h2><p>With the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable option, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application platform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy parameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves quite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any currency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS, Blockstack, etc).</p><p>The project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design decentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services, and is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized applications very user-friendly. The project is built on the foundation of privacy and security, and as such is having its breakthrough privacy protocol (RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase) reviewed for any flaw by the NJIT Department of Technology.</p><p>Particl aims at decentralizing popular web services as well as the cryptocurrency ecosystem and making them private-by-default, heralding a new, secure, private and trust-less way for people to use the internet while keeping their private life provably private.\n\n</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Case-for-Privacy-in-the-Tech-Industry/1-kjhAZ5nvH9SnqAZGsTCyrQ.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data.

It could then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and be configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after pre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the “amnesic” properties."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"it-s-not-only-about-transactions-and-uploaded-data-"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Another security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to protecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection.

were released\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509] \nand a lot of real world, person-to-person eCommerce has already begun to take\nshape… and on a testnet no less!\n\nGetting the ball rolling.\nThe Particl team could think of no better way to distribute some official swag\nwhile educating future users on the ins-and-outs of the Marketplace then by\ncreating listings for real products as we test and build.\n\nAlthough there is a sea of test listings for imaginary products by our active\ncommunity, the official t-shirts can be easily searched for by typing “t-shirts”\nor scrolling to the bottom of the categories box to “Particl Swag”\n\nGo ahead! Download [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] the\nMarketplace builds for testnet and purchase one for yourself. It’s easy and it’s\nfree!\n\n> All currency running over the testnet is our testnet-PART or tPART for short and\nhas no value.Coins are freely given at our Particl Testnet Faucet\n[http://faucet.particl.xyz/] and you get the added security that you’re using\nhouse money and are at no risk to make a mistake using your own PART.\n\nSales After 1 Week\nWe’ve had nearly 35 users begin the process of purchasing real tees —these are\nreal t-shirts folks! They will show up at your door and the purchase will be\ncompleted without any 3rd-party pushing in to collect personal data and charging\nfees for doing nothing.\n\nThis is actually a great time to bring back the infographic of the sell/buy\nprocess on Particl Marketplace alpha and walk through some of the dialogs you’ll\nsee as you walk through the process.\n\nIt’s also important to note that at the point of this blog publishing, I’ve gone\nthrough the entire order book for the t-shirts and have accepted and/or rejected\nall bids in my queue. That’s important to consider if you’ve placed a bid on one\nof the shirts and you’re wondering the next steps.\n\nBidding\nItems in your cart that you have placed a bid on to purchase will have the “\nBidding” label.\n\nThe label means you’ve sent a desire to purchase the item to the seller and the\nball is now in their court. The same “Bidding” labeled box shows up in the\nSeller’s order book.\n\n> Important: If you have placed a bid on an official shirt and you still see the\nbox labeled “Bidding” then I missed seeing your bid and you should place another\nbid. As I said, the queue I can see in my order book is cleared on my end and\nnow awaiting buyers to actually purchase the items and put it into “Escrow”.\nIn this Alpha version of the Particl Marketplace all bids last 48 hours. So I\nmight have missed your order if you placed it immediately after launch. Please\nplace another order so we can get you your shirts!\n\nAwaiting\nWhen a seller has accepted your bid then the order book displays the “Awaiting”\nlabel. Now the ball is back in your court to actually purchase the item; hence\nwhy the seller is waiting.\n\n * Recall the info-graphic above to see entire process.\n\nIt’s ok! This is a new experience. This is a good example of starting something\nnew in a testnet environment. With a little guidance I hope the process seems\nlogical and with practice it should become easy and understandable.\n\nNow, like I’ve said, I’ve cleared my queue as of this article. All my orders are\neither “Awaiting” or “Declined”. Declined orders are only multiple item orders.\nWe’re trying to limit the amount of free shirts people receive so there are\nenough for others.\n\nEscrow\nThis is the box I want to see in my store so that I know the buyer has gone\nforward and purchased the item. Again, I implore you, if you’ve placed a bid on\nand item like our official Particl shirts, return to the Marketplace and check \nyour cart.\n\nA few users have been confused by the process, understandably — it’s new to all\nof us. Their comments have been that they thought they were buying the shirts\nwhen they placed a Bid on them with step 1.\n\n * Again, refer to the info-graphic.\n\nAfter the seller accepts the bid the buyer still must pay for the item and place\na deposit in escrow. So the seller’s order book will display “Awaiting” until\nthe item has been paid. Then the box changes to “Escrow” and it is now up to the\nseller to ship the item.\n\nTo be continued\nI’ll leave the rest for a followup post as shirts get shipped/received and\nhopefully we start to see some selfies with Particl swag all over social media\nonce the shirts arrive!\n\nFor those users who have paid for the items and are awaiting shipping\n(specifically on the t-shirts), I will begin filling those orders Monday June\n11th. FYI\n\nWe’ve been diligent about reaching out in our general chat channels to make\nbroad announcements as to what steps we’re in with the real products running on\na live testnet.\n\nAs a sidenote, this isn’t the ideal way for buyers and sellers to communicate.\nAgain, this is an MVP, not a finished product, but it validates the importance\nof our secure private messaging (SMSG) to be available for communication between\nbuyers and sellers. It’s a convenience that is coming but is sorely missed in\nthis first release of Particl Marketplace.\n\nHappy Test Shopping!\nParticl Team","html":"<p>Last week the official Particl Marketplace Alpha builds were <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509\">released</a> and a lot of real world, person-to-person eCommerce has already begun to take shape… <em><strong>and on a testnet no less!</strong></em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Week-In-Review--Official-Particl-Swag-being-purchased-on-Alpha-Market-Testnet/1-qKvZ57VL0yIHYvfit_36jA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"getting-the-ball-rolling-\">Getting the ball rolling.</h2><p>The Particl team could think of no better way to distribute some official swag while educating future users on the ins-and-outs of the Marketplace then by creating listings for real products as we test and build.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Week-In-Review--Official-Particl-Swag-being-purchased-on-Alpha-Market-Testnet/1-26cX91shA6Ui41sNHnyTbg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Although there is a sea of test listings for imaginary products by our active community, the official t-shirts can be easily searched for by typing “<em><strong>t-shirts</strong></em>” or scrolling to the bottom of the categories box to “<em><strong>Particl Swag</strong></em>”</p><p><em>Go ahead! </em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\"><em>Download</em></a><em> the Marketplace builds for testnet and purchase one for yourself. </em><strong>It’s easy and it’s free!</strong></p><blockquote>All currency running over the testnet is our testnet-PART or tPART for short and has no value.Coins are freely given at our <a href=\"http://faucet.particl.xyz/\">Particl Testnet Faucet</a> and you get the added security that you’re using house money and are at no risk to make a mistake using your own PART.<br></blockquote><h2 id=\"sales-after-1-week\">Sales After 1 Week</h2><p>We’ve had nearly 35 users begin the process of purchasing real tees — <strong>these are real t-shirts folks!</strong> They will show up at your door and the purchase will be completed without any 3rd-party pushing in to collect personal data and charging fees for doing nothing.</p><p>This is actually a great time to bring back the infographic of the sell/buy process on Particl Marketplace alpha and walk through some of the dialogs you’ll see as you walk through the process.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Week-In-Review--Official-Particl-Swag-being-purchased-on-Alpha-Market-Testnet/1-2nHQFdzONYiX-76ufs0_uw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It’s also important to note that at the point of this blog publishing, <strong>I’ve gone through the entire order book for the t-shirts and have accepted and/or rejected all bids in my queue.</strong> That’s important to consider if you’ve placed a bid on one of the shirts and you’re wondering the next steps.</p><h3 id=\"bidding\">Bidding</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Week-In-Review--Official-Particl-Swag-being-purchased-on-Alpha-Market-Testnet/1-uGRD1oz_eGqfU5fXo-1tTQ.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Items in <strong>your cart</strong> that you have placed a bid on to purchase will have the “<em><strong>Bidding</strong></em>” label.</p><p>The label means you’ve sent a desire to purchase the item to the seller and the ball is now in their court.

His\ngoal was to tap into the video blog genre to help promote Particl, as well as\nprivacy rights, decentralized ecommerce and financial freedom (individual\nsovereignty).\n\nWe are excited to bring Desi-Rae on to exclusively cover Particl and also\nsupport her research into other benefits blockchain tech and the space can lead\nus in the future.\n\nI had a chance to ask her some questions about her background and passions\nrecently.\n\nPS: You have an academic process by how you learn and then present your content.\nWhat is your background?\n\nDRC: My background is in scientific research and data collection, as well as\nvisual art, specifically oil painting. I studied Biology and Studio Arts in\nschool and have always been interested in many things and the process of\nlearning itself. As you can possibly tell from my videos, I enjoy encountering\nsomething new and then finding out more about it, particularly by doing research\nthat provides data to answer a question. But I am also interested in the\naesthetic environment of a presentation, in terms of visuals, tone and mood, and\nnot only the presentation of the actual information.\n\nPS: How did you get into the cryptocurrency space?\n\nDRC: I got into the cryptocurrency space through osmosis. I knew and followed\npeople who were interested in cryptocurrency. I had a minimal amount of interest\nin the technology behind it. This is in the sense that I like to understand how\nthe world around me works, and not be ignorant of the basic functioning of many\nthings that I come to rely upon and use. However, I may not know how to build\nsomething myself. I was also drawn into the cryptocurrency space through the\nappeal of investing long term for financial gain, something which is in some\nways barred from individuals who are not already in the financial world due to\nhow the law handles those kinds of scenarios.\n\nPS: What type of content do you want to bring to the Particl community and the\ncryptocurrency space in general?\n\nDRC: I want to bring content to the cryptocurrency space that makes people\ncurious, engaged, and hopefully enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. There is a\nlot of content available for anyone who wants to learn. Really, there are video\nseries and lectures, from any standpoint, such as knowing how to code,\nunderstanding how blockchains or features of a cryptocurrency work, figuring out\nhow to trade or invest, and so on. Anything. Anyone can learn anything. So, my\ninterest is in shaping how a person can interact within that space, with the\npersonalities involved and the way they receive that information. And I think my\nbigger focus would be on understanding concepts rather than the full details,\nand just having a line of communication between the official project and the\ncommunity at large or potential supporters or contributors.\n\nPS: Do you think privacy is important?\n\nDRC: With an emphatic yes, I think that privacy is very important. I possibly\ncouldn’t stress enough how much. People will pay a premium amount of money to\nhave their own space and have thicker walls in an apartment building. A person\ndoes not speak the same way in a space depending who is around. Why do we need\nto dance alone in our rooms before dancing in front of a crowd? Why are ballots\nusually secret? It’s important to be able to reflect in one’s own time too.\nPrivacy is an extension of self-ownership, to have the ability to choose how\nmuch one shares about themselves, their thoughts and feelings. As it relate to\ncryptocurrency, a privacy focused project such as Particl brings back privacy to\nan increasingly public space, due to the power of technology and the current\nneed for people in the background to make things run smoothly as one uses their\nproduct and services, such as services that help us manage our finances or\nparticipate in the global marketplace.\n\nPS: What excites you about Particl the most?\n\nDRC: This isn’t something that I really knew before, but Particl was started by\na group of people who decided to work on something together, as opposed to an\nalready established institution funding a project. I think a great thing is when\npeople see a problem, and try to solve it, or have an idea, and get to work on\nit. I know what Particl is doing in terms of implementing privacy technology is\ncool, for lack of a better word, but I think it’s even cooler that people found\na way to put their skillsets together and create a community around an idea. I\nalso think in terms of seeing an issue with marketplaces such as how centralized\nthey are, or the lack of privacy in financial dealings in general as we rely on\nbanks, it is good to actually find a path independent of simply complaining\nabout how others are not doing it the right way.\n\nPS: How did you get into doing video blogs?\n\nDRC: I got into doing video blogs first as a way to share my artwork with\nothers, bring visibility to myself, and communicate with people who were fans of\nmy work. I then also began to share my voice with others on topics I thought\nwere important as I felt the social and political climate around me shifting.\nOvertime, I found fulfillment in connecting with others through common\ninterests. I now appreciate the gift of being able to communicate with others in\na way that I did not before I was making video blogs.\n\nPS: It is nice hearing someone explain they are still learning about technology\nwhile they are also presenting it.

What is your background?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>My background is in scientific research and data collection, as well as visual art, specifically oil painting. I studied Biology and Studio Arts in school and have always been interested in many things and the process of learning itself. As you can possibly tell from my videos, I enjoy encountering something new and then finding out more about it, particularly by doing research that provides data to answer a question. But I am also interested in the aesthetic environment of a presentation, in terms of visuals, tone and mood, and not only the presentation of the actual information.</p><p><strong>PS: How did you get into the cryptocurrency space?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>I got into the cryptocurrency space through osmosis. I knew and followed people who were interested in cryptocurrency. I had a minimal amount of interest in the technology behind it. This is in the sense that I like to understand how the world around me works, and not be ignorant of the basic functioning of many things that I come to rely upon and use. However, I may not know how to build something myself. I was also drawn into the cryptocurrency space through the appeal of investing long term for financial gain, something which is in some ways barred from individuals who are not already in the financial world due to how the law handles those kinds of scenarios.</p><p><strong>PS: What type of content do you want to bring to the Particl community and the cryptocurrency space in general?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>I want to bring content to the cryptocurrency space that makes people curious, engaged, and hopefully enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. There is a lot of content available for anyone who wants to learn. Really, there are video series and lectures, from any standpoint, such as knowing how to code, understanding how blockchains or features of a cryptocurrency work, figuring out how to trade or invest, and so on. Anything. Anyone can learn anything. So, my interest is in shaping how a person can interact within that space, with the personalities involved and the way they receive that information. And I think my bigger focus would be on understanding concepts rather than the full details, and just having a line of communication between the official project and the community at large or potential supporters or contributors.</p><p><strong>PS: Do you think privacy is important?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>With an emphatic yes, I think that privacy is very important. I possibly couldn’t stress enough how much. People will pay a premium amount of money to have their own space and have thicker walls in an apartment building. A person does not speak the same way in a space depending who is around. Why do we need to dance alone in our rooms before dancing in front of a crowd? Why are ballots usually secret? It’s important to be able to reflect in one’s own time too. Privacy is an extension of self-ownership, to have the ability to choose how much one shares about themselves, their thoughts and feelings. As it relate to cryptocurrency, a privacy focused project such as Particl brings back privacy to an increasingly public space, due to the power of technology and the current need for people in the background to make things run smoothly as one uses their product and services, such as services that help us manage our finances or participate in the global marketplace.</p><p><strong>PS: What excites you about Particl the most?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>This isn’t something that I really knew before, but Particl was started by a group of people who decided to work on something together, as opposed to an already established institution funding a project. I think a great thing is when people see a problem, and try to solve it, or have an idea, and get to work on it. I know what Particl is doing in terms of implementing privacy technology is cool, for lack of a better word, but I think it’s even cooler that people found a way to put their skillsets together and create a community around an idea. I also think in terms of seeing an issue with marketplaces such as how centralized they are, or the lack of privacy in financial dealings in general as we rely on banks, it is good to actually find a path independent of simply complaining about how others are not doing it the right way.</p><p><strong>PS: How did you get into doing video blogs?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>I got into doing video blogs first as a way to share my artwork with others, bring visibility to myself, and communicate with people who were fans of my work. I then also began to share my voice with others on topics I thought were important as I felt the social and political climate around me shifting. Overtime, I found fulfillment in connecting with others through common interests. I now appreciate the gift of being able to communicate with others in a way that I did not before I was making video blogs.</p><p><strong>PS: It is nice hearing someone explain they are still learning about technology while they are also presenting it.

Everyone is anticipating the\nutility features coming out this quarter like the E2EE communication tools and\ndecentralized marketplace.\n\nParticl Desktop is the app all those cool things get rolled into.\n\nParticl Desktop 1.1.0-RC4 (testnet)\nParticl Desktop releases exclusively on Testnet today. This build fixes a lot of\nbugs and also has some new, cool features like ZAP. We need as many testers\nvolunteering to find issues/bugs with this release candidate (RC4) before we\nmake this available on Mainnet in 10 days.\n\nparticl/particl-desktop [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases]\nparticl-desktop - Particl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases]\n\nGlossary\n> Mainnet- Particl’s live blockchain. This is the chain we all use to send PART \nbetween addresses.- Explorer: https://explorer.particl.io/\nTestnet- Particl’s testing environment. This is a separate blockchain from\nMainnet with separate coins from Mainnet.\n- Explorer: https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/\n\nTestnet PART won’t show up on the Mainnet blockchain and vice-versa for Mainnet\nPART and Testnet blockchain.\n\nRelease Notes\nThe team spent time fixing bugs, adding new features and streamlining the flow\nof the GUI. Some pages have been updated to better the user experience.\nFurthermore, a major restructure effort over the GUI codebase has been\ncompleted.\n\nThe code is now more modular, less prone to errors and takes advantage of the\ncapabilities that the latest Angular provides. This pre-marketplace code\nrestructuration will enable us to implement features like auto-update and\nmultiwallet in a much better way.\n\nAs the marketplace will also be integrated soon, we renamed the software to the\nsimple and beautiful “Particl Desktop”.

[https://github.com/particlcommunity/rfps/blob/master/rfp-0000/rfp-0000.mediawiki]\n\nRFP 1 | Particl Cold Staking Pool\nCreate a cold staking pool for users to delegate their staking power to a pool\noperator in exchange for smaller payouts. Once completed, the code shall be\nopen-sourced for anyone to inspect/audit.\n\nWhat is Cold Staking?\nCold staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely\ndelegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of\nthese “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the\nParticl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to\nspend its coins.\n\nCold staking nodes are intended to be used in combination with cold, hardware\nand paper wallets as well as multisig addresses, making it possible to stake\n“offline” coins with no risk of being hacked or exposing your public key to the\nnetwork. Staking nodes can be set up on any device, secure or not, such as\npublic/cloud servers, virtual machines or RPIs.\n\nScope\nThe recent cold staking hardfork has enabled the possibility to set up cold\nstaking pools where operators cannot run with their users’ coins.

In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public. While you share\nyour Particl address with others so that they can send you coins, your Particl\naddress is only a hash of your public key, not the public key itself.\n\n> A hash function is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and\nturns it into a cryptographic output. By one-way I mean that you can’t derive\nthe input from the output. It’s kind of like encrypting something then losing\nthe key.\nWhat does that mean in English?\nAll of that is a complicated way of saying that while an attacker with a quantum\ncomputer could derive the private key from the public key, they couldn’t derive\nthe public key from the Particl address since the public key was run through\nmultiple quantum-resistant one-way hash functions.\n\n— Classic!So how does this all fit together?\nThe cold staking feature consists of several key components:\n\n * your “staking node” (running a new wallet)\n * your “wallet” with your coins (much like today) and\n * a “cold staking script” — this is like the script in bitcoin or smart\n   contracts on other alts\n\nOnce activated your staking node signs transactions with its private key, thus\nyour real public key for your actual PART tokens is never exposed onto the\nblockchain, until you actually spend them, in which case the change always goes\ninto a new address where the public key is not known.\n\nCold Staking In Action\nAgain, cold staking consists of the following components — your staking node,\nyour wallet and a cold staking script.\n\nWhat is the cold staking script?\n\nIt is essentially a smart contract that says `if this is a cold staking\ntransaction, then allow the private key from the staking node to sign the\ntransaction; otherwise the private key from the wallet is required.`\n\nLet’s walk through the process of setting cold staking up\n1First step is to setup a new “staking node”. A staking node is a full\nblockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet”\n(aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a\ndedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.\n\n> It is important to note that CPU does matter when staking, so do not expect to\nget the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.\nOnce the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then\ngenerate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in\nthe next step).\n\n**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will\nbe made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is\ndeemed secure.**\n\n2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold\nStaking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1).\nEnter this and click activate.\n\nSo what exactly did we just do?\nFirst, you have created a cold staking script config which includes the public\nkey for the staking node to whom you have delegated staking powers to.\n\nSecond, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block\nfrom staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress\nbar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS\ncurrently does) but these outputs will be part of the cold staking script.\n\nThird, the next time you spend any Particl from your wallet the client will also\nautomatically include the cold staking script— from thereon. Once the Cold\nStaking progress bar reaches 100% activation your wallet can remain offline and\nthe staking node you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without\nrisking any of the PART in your wallet.\n\nIt is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script”\nsmart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies\nto cold staking:\n\n> if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same\naddress with the same minimum value as the input\nIn short, what this means is “If I staked 1,000 PART from my\nPar7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address then 1,000 PART must go back to the\nsame address” for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.\n\nThis is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake\nyour coins and not spend them.\n\nIt is also worth noting here that any value greater than the input value, aka\nthe reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node. So in\ntheory you could — as part of cold staking — send your staked coins back to your\nwallet address (as per consensus) and send the stake reward to a different\naddress.\n\n?Future Applications\nThis flexibility at the protocol consensus level pave the road for several new\nfeatures in the future such as:\n\n * staking pools\n * donating staking rewards to other causes\n * sending staking rewards to exchange to provide liquidity\n\nThe cold staking protocol is agnostic, so that it works with all public balances\n(anon and blind cannot stake) including those protected by multi-signature\naddresses.\n\nIn the future we envision an upgrade to our Particl Copay App that will add Cold\nStaking support. That will allow us to take advantage of the wallet’s excellent\nmulti-signature support and enable a whole host of new security benefits,\nincluding but not limited to:\n\n * cold staking with multi-signature (ie. your “staking node” will stake but to\n   spend funds you will need m-of-n signatures\n * integration with hardware devices (like Ledger or Trezor) for key signing\n   (providing the utmost level of security when combined with multi-signature\n   and cold staking).\n\nBrief statement about tomorrow’s hardfork\nAs the hardfork cometh at midnight, we’re going to let everyone continue to\nupgrade and track the health of the blockchain for around 12–24 hours. We know\neveryone is anxious to build their Cold Staking contract but what is most\nimportant is ensuring the blockchain and all PART are secure.\n\nThe GUI is getting waxed and buffed for tomorrow’s debut and we’re also\npreparing some guides for the GUI so people can walk through setting up your\ncold staking contracts.\n\nThank you\nParticl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Primer--Cold-Staking-on-Particl/0-HrZMzdYyRd0LIyut.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"quantum-computer-resistant\">Quantum Computer Resistant</h2><p><strong>How? </strong>In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public.

A staking node is a full blockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet” (aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a dedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.</p><blockquote>It is important to note that CPU <strong>does</strong> matter when staking, so do not expect to get the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.</blockquote><p>Once the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then generate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in the next step).</p><p><strong>**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will be made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is deemed secure.**</strong></p><p>2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold Staking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1). Enter this and click activate.</p><h3 id=\"so-what-exactly-did-we-just-do\">So what exactly did we just do?</h3><p>First, you have created a <strong>cold staking script</strong> config which includes the public key for the <strong>staking node</strong> to whom you have delegated staking powers to.</p><p>Second, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block from staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress bar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS currently does) but these outputs will be part of the <strong>cold staking script</strong>.</p><p>Third, the next time you spend any Particl from your <strong>wallet</strong> the client will also automatically include the <strong>cold staking script</strong> — from thereon. Once the Cold Staking progress bar reaches 100% activation your <strong>wallet</strong> can remain offline and the <strong>staking node</strong> you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without risking any of the PART in your wallet.</p><p><strong>It is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script” smart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies to cold staking:</strong></p><blockquote>if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same address with the same minimum value as the input</blockquote><p>In short, what this means is <em>“If I staked 1,000 PART from my Par7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address </em><em><strong>then</strong></em><em> 1,000 PART must go back to the same address”</em> for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.</p><p><strong>This is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake your coins and not spend them.</strong></p><p>It is also worth noting here that any value <strong>greater</strong> than the input value, aka the reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node.
