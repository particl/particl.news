Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

(partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave.

However, we expect to resume development of this department on\na full-time capacity in the near future.\nParticl Marketplace Moderation ?️\nIn our commitment to maintaining the safety and integrity of Particl\nMarketplace, we've resumed our research into a better, more efficient content\nmoderation system. Those familiar with the project know about the\nalready-existing crowdsourced moderation system which, while functional, is\nstill in its early stages and needs further refinement to effectively minimize\nexposure to undesirable content for the end-user while improving it's\npro-activity.\n\nModerating a decentralized marketplace without introducing central points of\nfailure is a real challenge. On one hand, it cannot put too much responsibility\non end-users, as that means they have to be constantly exposed to undesirable\ncontent so that they can vote it out. But on the other hand, it also cannot put\nthat responsibility into specific users, moderation staff, groups of people, or\norganizations, as that defeats the very purpose of a decentralized system and\nintroduces central points of failure and liability.\n\nOur proposed solution would leverage Particl's staking pools, voting delegation,\nand the potential of LLM (large language models) to more proactively moderate\ncontent. This innovative approach would allow for pre-screening based on\ncommunity-driven policies, removing inappropriate listings before they even\nreach users. The end result is a painless user experience that is free from\nundesirable content and doesn't require the end-user to act as a moderator and\nbe exposed to undesirable content.\n\nKeep in mind that this system is still theoretical, with ongoing research\nfocused on integrating LLM capabilities and refining the implementation strategy\nwithout any sacrifice to the level of decentralization or privacy. Once fully\ndeployed, this model could lead the way in terms of decentralized moderation\nwithout central points of failure or undue burden on users.\n\nWe will continue our research and provide a detailed update on Particl News once\nwe finalize the design. This approach, if successful, could set a precedent for\naddressing moderation challenges in decentralized environments without\nsacrifices to decentralization.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, focusing on the various items contained in\nthe list below.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nRemember that, in the interest of pushing updates more quickly and as the array\nof dependency updates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development\ndebts of the past few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with\nmost of the updates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent\nupdate (i.e., 3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n> Note: Particl Desktop development is currently being worked on on a part-time\nbasis, which is expected to result in slower development pace compared to Core\nor BasicSwap DEX. However, we expect to resume development of this department on\na full-time capacity in the near future.\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Allow users to select which coins to show prices for on offers page\n? Move v13 from dev to master — not compatible with previous versions\n? Change sending the rate over in bids to sending the amount_to\n? Fix invalid amount error with large values\n\nDecred Integration ✅\nWe've been working on integrating Decred into BasicSwap, making satisfying\nprogress all throughout the week. Here is the relevant progress report in\nregards to that specific deliverable:\n\n☑️ Collect Decred chain parameters\n☑️ Encode and decode Decred addresses\n☑️ Call Decred RPC commands\n☑️ Start and manage DCR daemon from BasicSwap\n☑️ Start and manage DCR wallet from BasicSwap\n? Add Decred to basicswap-prepare setup script\n? Integrate Decred wallet functionality into DEX\n? Add a series of Decred tests (in-progress)\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nFollowing up on last week's update, we have completed all the remaining parts of\nthe v3 GUI update, except for the changes to the New Offer pages. This means\nthat the planned changes to the bids/offers pages, modals, popups, alerts, and\nother minor updates have all been finalized this week.\n\nOnce the changes to the New Offer page are completed, the dev branch will be\nmerged, marking the official release of BasicSwap's GUI version 3.0.0.\n\nKeep an eye out for updates being pushed to the dev branch on Github, and as\nalways, if you would like to test these changes before they make it into the \nmaster branch, you can change your active BasicSwap branch to the dev branch\n(using git checkout dev) and updating BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nas you would typically do for a regular update.\n\nInstallation Wizard (Windows) ?‍♂️\nOnce most of the tasks regarding the 3.0.0 version of the GUI are wrapped up, we\nwill prepare an update to the installation wizard on Windows, integrating bug\nfixes and improvements as suggested by the community.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDr. Kap on the Paranoid Machinery Podcast \nDr. Kap had an excellent appearance on the new Paranoid Machinery podcast in\nwhich they discussed privacy, BasicSwap DEX, and the decentralized eCommerce. \n\nClick here\n[https://podcast.paranoiamachinery.com/@paranoia_machinery/episodes/dr-kapil-amarasinghe-particl-particl-marketplace-basic-swap-dex-episode-3/activity] \nto listen to the podcast, here [https://youtu.be/2c_U-kC0VmY] to watch on our\nYoutube channel, or simply refer to the embedded media player above.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
