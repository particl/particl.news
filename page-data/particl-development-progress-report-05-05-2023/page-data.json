We'll delve into\nthis topic later on.\n\nAbout the Event \nFrom the beginning, Monerotopia aimed to be different from large corporate\ncryptocurrency events such as Consensus or Bitcoin Miami. Indeed, the focus was\non quality over quantity, yet the event still attracted a respectable number of\nattendees. \n\nThis was partly due to Monerotopia's decision to establish a market of craftsmen\nin the event's center, many of whom later became Monero sellers, but really, the\nsheer number of quality projects either presenting or attending was enough to\ndraw in a very focused crowd.\n\nThe venue was divided into distinct areas such as the market, main stage (where\nDr. Kap spoke), remote stage, privacy tech loft, and a workshop zone. Traffic\nremained consistently high across all areas, reflecting the good choice of\nlocation for that particular event.\n\nGoals at Monerotopia \nWith a privacy and liberty-centric theme and an impressive lineup of projects,\nincluding Monero-based Cake Wallet, Monerujo, and SeraiDEX, but also other\nprivacy projects such as Firo, Nym, Oxen/Session, Zano, only to name a few, our\ngoal was to establish valuable connections with other projects and key\nindividuals. Unfortunately, DarkFi was unable to attend, but we hope to catch up\nwith them at Monerokon next month. \n\nOur mission was to create connections, make new friends, and explore\ncollaborative potential with other projects and individuals, and to that we can\nsay that it was a definitive success. We eagerly anticipate the many\nopportunities and future collaborations resulting from these discussions, as\nthey will be a major contributor to make preserving privacy and freedom easier\nthan ever before.\n\nDr Kap’s Presentation \nOn the event's final day, we were honored to give a 40-minute presentation to a\nfull room of privacy enthusiasts. The response to our message was incredibly\npositive, and it visibly resonated with the audience a lot.\n\n> Dr Kap @thegreatestdoc [https://twitter.com/thegreatestdoc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] \npresenting BasicSwap an atomic swap DEX in beta (with $FIRO\n[https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FIRO&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] support) and\npromoting a more inclusive privacy coin ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/Q4TYGZD9TS\n[https://t.co/Q4TYGZD9TS]\n\n— Firo $FIRO (@firoorg) May 7, 2023\n[https://twitter.com/firoorg/status/1655312001956999169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nThe speech was attended by various individuals and projects we had networked\nwith throughout the event, as well as some Particl community members who\ntraveled to Mexico to meet us and a whole slew of new faces. With multiple\nrounds of applause and high enthusiasm, the speech was, in our view, a\nresounding success.\n\nWhile it was broadcast live for virtual ticket holders, it will be publicly\npublished online by the Monerotopia crew very soon.\n\nParticl Booth at the Privacy Loft\nAlthough the event prioritized quality over quantity, our booth consistently\nattracted attendees and saw a considerable boost in activity after Dr Kap's\npresentation. \n\nThe smaller crowd allowed for longer, more meaningful conversations with people\ngenuinely interested in the topics of privacy and freedom, and it helped in\nbuilding more solid relationships with awesome people. This also enabled us to\nexplore the venue and support our new friends by attending to their speeches.\n\nNew Friends \nWe are thrilled to have established new friendships and strengthened existing\nones with various projects and individuals. These connections will undoubtedly\nbenefit the advancement of privacy technology as a whole.\n\nAs everyone begins returning home or settling in, we look forward to continuing\nthe many ongoing discussions about collaborations, partnerships, and\nintegrations with them. We are thrilled to support them in their groundbreaking\nwork and look forward to helping each other in solidarity.\n\nAs Dr Kap's speech demonstrated, Particl and BasicSwap aim to create a coherent\nlayer that unites privacy projects by building not only technology but also\ngenuine, lasting relationships. Monerotopia was a stepping stone for the project\nin that sense.\n\nMoving Forward \nWith the overwhelmingly positive reaction received at the event, we are, now\nmore than ever, eager to participate in more events and gatherings.\n\nIn fact, Particl has been invited to present at Monerokon 2023 next month. This\ntechnical presentation will focus on BasicSwap's relationship with Monero, and\nmany of the people we met this weekend will be in attendance or presenting as\nwell.\n\nIf you are aware of privacy and liberty-focused events, please send the\ninformation our way. We would love to get out there and meet you if it's close\nto your location!\n\nAnd now, hard work continues and let's keep pushing the boundaries by making\nprivacy and pro-liberty tech more accessible and inter-connected than before!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Indeed, the focus was on quality over quantity, yet the event still attracted a respectable number of attendees. </p><p>This was partly due to Monerotopia's decision to establish a market of craftsmen in the event's center, many of whom later became Monero sellers, but really, the sheer number of quality projects either presenting or attending was enough to draw in a very focused crowd.</p><p>The venue was divided into distinct areas such as the market, main stage (where Dr. Kap spoke), remote stage, privacy tech loft, and a workshop zone. Traffic remained consistently high across all areas, reflecting the good choice of location for that particular event.</p><h2 id=\"goals-at-monerotopia\">Goals at Monerotopia </h2><p>With a privacy and liberty-centric theme and an impressive lineup of projects, including Monero-based Cake Wallet, Monerujo, and SeraiDEX, but also other privacy projects such as Firo, Nym, Oxen/Session, Zano, only to name a few, our goal was to establish valuable connections with other projects and key individuals. Unfortunately, DarkFi was unable to attend, but we hope to catch up with them at Monerokon next month. </p><p>Our mission was to create connections, make new friends, and explore collaborative potential with other projects and individuals, and to that we can say that it was a definitive success. We eagerly anticipate the many opportunities and future collaborations resulting from these discussions, as they will be a major contributor to make preserving privacy and freedom easier than ever before.</p><h2 id=\"dr-kap-s-presentation\">Dr Kap’s Presentation </h2><p>On the event's final day, we were honored to give a 40-minute presentation to a full room of privacy enthusiasts.

Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
