Download [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] the\nMarketplace builds for testnet and purchase one for yourself.

They will show up at your door and the purchase will be\ncompleted without any 3rd-party pushing in to collect personal data and charging\nfees for doing nothing.\n\nThis is actually a great time to bring back the infographic of the sell/buy\nprocess on Particl Marketplace alpha and walk through some of the dialogs you’ll\nsee as you walk through the process.\n\nIt’s also important to note that at the point of this blog publishing, I’ve gone\nthrough the entire order book for the t-shirts and have accepted and/or rejected\nall bids in my queue.

The same “Bidding” labeled box shows up in the\nSeller’s order book.\n\n> Important: If you have placed a bid on an official shirt and you still see the\nbox labeled “Bidding” then I missed seeing your bid and you should place another\nbid. As I said, the queue I can see in my order book is cleared on my end and\nnow awaiting buyers to actually purchase the items and put it into “Escrow”.\nIn this Alpha version of the Particl Marketplace all bids last 48 hours.

This is a good example of starting something\nnew in a testnet environment.

The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to\nbuild trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly\nprivate?\n\nOne of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with\nwhom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than\nthey ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get\nour data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have\nspecifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable\npractices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make\nmoney out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the\nvery people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit\nthe servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to\nanother company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard\nto keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for\nwhat purpose.\n\nWhy Does It Even Matter?\n“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically\ncommodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users\nfrom whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified\nabout it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for\nfree while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads? Nothing is\nfree on the internet, companies exist for the sole purpose of making profits and\nhuge websites have huge maintenance costs. When a platform appears as free, it\nis most likely because you are making “personal data payments”.\n\n * “Data is the new oil” — Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC\n   Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of Move Fast and Break Things: How\n   Google, Facebook, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\n\nOn one hand, this “data economy” is good for partner companies that can then\nmake their products and platforms arguably better for their users. The ability\nfor them to know who exactly is using their platform allows them to make a much\nmore customized and personal experience. But on the other hand, things can get\nugly quickly.\n\nMaking money off your back\nThe most common and recurring concern from the public when it comes to personal\ndata sharing is the fact that companies are making millions if not billions\nreselling every single detail of our private lives to whoever is willing to pay\nfor it. Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken\nfrom, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where\nit is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly\nkept in the dark even though it affects them directly.\n\nNo consent\nAs it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what\nhappens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares\nit with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their\npersonal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly\naffect anybody is with the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal. In that particular\nscenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data\nanalytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the\nRepublican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words,\nevery Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their\npolitical rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so\nunwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has\ngone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude\nreality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you,\nwith or without your consent or knowledge.\n\nIn the wrong hands\nWhen you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only\ntrust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it\nsecure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very\nvaluable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the\nexponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal\ndata as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit\ncard numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals\nconstantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of\nthumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from\nits users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that\nyou are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain\ncontinuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being\nbreached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other\ncompanies.\n\nKeeping your private life private\nOne of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact\nthat privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice\nto keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like\nit. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality\nservice without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.\n\n> “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing\nto hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you\nhave nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden\nThe GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?\nA couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when\nthe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into\neffect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses\nthe sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give\ncontrol to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified\nand stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies\nclearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they\nwill do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as\nto how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it\nsecure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the\nprotection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.\n\nDo we really have a choice?\nIn the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the\nnew terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new\nterms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In\nsome cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative\nservices that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an\nundertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users\ncould lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even\ncontact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to\naccept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece\nof software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are\nnow owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or\nApple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their\nwide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a\nrather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior\nuser-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people\nwill accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information\nto the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.\n\nYou still need to trust them!\nSecondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or\nincompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should\nthey misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will\nnever happen, as was evidenced by the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal in which Facebook\nseemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal\ndata. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get\nhacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their\nterms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data\ntheft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of\nregulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases,\nsucceed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.\n\nThe Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers\nIn the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an\nopportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only\nvery recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new\ntechnologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous\nsection, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the\ncompany behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your\npersonal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the\nneed to trust a third-party? There actually is!\n\nBlockchain technology allows two or more users to directly exchange data without\nthe use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular\nuse-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as\nBitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached\nto it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone\nin the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a\npayment processor or a company.\n\nHowever, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual\ncurrencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be\nused to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called\ndecentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with\neach other without any third-party or company running the software. It is\npossible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could\nbuy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company\nlike Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but\ntaken a step further.\n\nIs Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?\nYes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the\nworld in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some\ndrawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are \npublic and permanent data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever\nbe publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain\ntechnology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is\nnot. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while\ntransactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to\ncryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user\nidentities can be revealed.\n\nThe case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being\nstored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain\nanalysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and\ngovernmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on\ntracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s\nDepartment of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense\n(military) contractor, in as early as 2016\n(https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/).\nThis, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly\nvisible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public\ntransactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or\npresent analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really\nwant our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone\ninterested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become\npowerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain\nsomeone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech\ngiant like Amazon.\n\nTaking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level\nThe blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly\nshare data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in\nterms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and\nmade private-by-design, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved\nif combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?\n\nPrivacy-focused blockchains are good…\nThe first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers\nuntraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data\ntransactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and\ngroundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where\ntransactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts,\nparticipants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and\nzero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles.\nNote that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency\ntransactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.\n\nPrivate-by-design blockchains are even better!\nTo be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be\nmandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an\nopt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having\nopt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made,\nthus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more\nsuspect.\n\nNot everything needs to be stored on-chain\nBlockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s\nnot ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound\nfiles, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in\nthere permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the\nentire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage\nboth a scaling and security nightmare.\n\nIt is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that\nuse the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their\naccompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that\nthese P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not\nentirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of\na decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized\nstorage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It\ncould then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and\nbe configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after\npre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the\n“amnesic” properties.\n\nIt’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!\nAnother security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to\nprotecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact,\nmost blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed\nconnection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers,\nmaking it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection\ninformation.\n\nAgain, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing\nbecomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design.

The best example to illustrate how this can directly affect anybody is with the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal. In that particular scenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data analytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the Republican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words, every Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their political rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so unwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has gone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude reality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you, with or without your consent or knowledge.</p><h3 id=\"in-the-wrong-hands\"><strong>In the wrong hands</strong></h3><p>When you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only trust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it secure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very valuable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the exponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal data as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit card numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals constantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of thumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from its users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that you are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain continuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being breached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other companies.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-your-private-life-private\"><strong>Keeping your private life private</strong></h3><p>One of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact that privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice to keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like it. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality service without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.</p><blockquote>“Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-gdpr-a-step-in-the-good-direction-but-is-it-enough\">The GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?</h2><p>A couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into effect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses the sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified and stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies clearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they will do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as to how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it secure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the protection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-really-have-a-choice\"><strong>Do we really have a choice?</strong></h3><p>In the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the new terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new terms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In some cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative services that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an undertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users could lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even contact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to accept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece of software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are now owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their wide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a rather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior user-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people will accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information to the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.</p><h3 id=\"you-still-need-to-trust-them-\"><strong>You still need to trust them!</strong></h3><p>Secondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or incompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should they misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will never happen, as was evidenced by the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal in which Facebook seemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal data. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get hacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their terms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data theft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of regulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases, succeed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.</p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-do-away-with-trusting-strangers\">The Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers</h3><p>In the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an opportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only very recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new technologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous section, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the company behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your personal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the need to trust a third-party? There actually is!</p><p><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> allows two or more users to directly exchange data without the use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular use-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached to it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone in the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a payment processor or a company.</p><p>However, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual currencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be used to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called decentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with each other without any third-party or company running the software. It is possible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could buy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company like Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but taken a step further.</p><h2 id=\"is-blockchain-technology-really-better-at-keeping-your-private-data-private\">Is Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?</h2><p>Yes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the world in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some drawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are <strong>public</strong> and <strong>permanent</strong> data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever be publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain technology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is not. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while transactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to cryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user identities can be revealed.</p><p>The case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being stored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain analysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and governmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on tracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s Department of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense (military) contractor, in as early as 2016 (https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/). This, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly visible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public transactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or present analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really want our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone interested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become powerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain someone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech giant like Amazon.</p><h2 id=\"taking-blockchain-technologies-to-the-next-level\">Taking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level</h2><p>The blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly share data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in terms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and made <strong>private-by-design</strong>, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved if combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?</p><h3 id=\"privacy-focused-blockchains-are-good-\"><strong>Privacy-focused blockchains are good…</strong></h3><p>The first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers untraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data transactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and groundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where transactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts, participants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and zero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles. Note that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency transactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"private-by-design-blockchains-are-even-better-\"><strong>Private-by-design blockchains are even better!</strong></h3><p>To be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be mandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an opt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having opt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made, thus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more suspect.</p><h3 id=\"not-everything-needs-to-be-stored-on-chain\"><strong>Not everything needs to be stored on-chain</strong></h3><p>Blockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s not ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound files, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in there permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the entire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage both a scaling and security nightmare.</p><p>It is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that use the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their accompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that these P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not entirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of a decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized storage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It could then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and be configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after pre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the “amnesic” properties.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-not-only-about-transactions-and-uploaded-data-\"><strong>It’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!</strong></h3><p>Another security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to protecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact, most blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed connection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers, making it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection information.</p><p>Again, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing becomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a small portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking suspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re stronger”!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-project-is-making-that-vision-a-reality\">The Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality</h2><p>With the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable option, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application platform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy parameters.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
