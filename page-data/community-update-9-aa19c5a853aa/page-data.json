This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it\nunprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale.\nTaking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for\nspammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds\ncontained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many\nstrategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and\nthat we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult\n“Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces,\ndecentralized or not.\n\nWhen is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?\nParticl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)Particl Marketplace Alpha is\nalready out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds\nthis week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it\nout, scroll down to the News & Updates section of this Community Update to find\nthe link to the blog post containing the builds.\n\nThe requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly\ndecentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet,\nand RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features\nsuch as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first\nversion of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet\nBeta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the\nmainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.\n\nAs we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop),\neach of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving\ndeadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of\nthem having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the\nmonth of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which\nwill also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of\nany kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone\nknow when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as\nit should.\n\nWhen’s the RingCT Hardfork?\nRingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve\ndecided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our\nimplementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than\nCryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation\nacademically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA.\nNote that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code\nas they requested.\n\nThe requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to\nbe fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on\nmainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it.\nThis should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and\nupdate their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact\nthat both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either\nautomatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is\nupdated to the latest version.\n\nAny plans on Presenting/Attending Events?\nYes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of\nNovember for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused\non development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the\nCommunications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the\nroad to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone\nmeeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is\ngoing to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great\nopportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.\n\nOne of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series\nof meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure\nwithin the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like\nto organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be\nsponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience\nand then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot\nof similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person\nin November and really finalize that launch strategy.\n\nWe’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as\nit relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had\ncommunity member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also\nreceived a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup\nwhich is already in the works.\n\nIt’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely\ndiligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to\nproperly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more\ndetails about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.\n\nWhat Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?\nAt the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to\nrepresent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we\nraise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.\n\nThat being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly\nencourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any\nserious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it\nlocal meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step\nup, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve\nyou!\n\nWill There Be a Launch Event?\nAbsolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be\nlaunching the marketplace on mainnet live. I’d be a great way to reveal the\nmarketplace to a large audience and get exposure from big players, investors,\nand cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We have a lot of ideas for this launch event and\nwe are quite excited to craft an exciting and fun launch strategy. The mainnet\nrelease of Particl Marketplace is a huge milestone for the Particl project, and\nwe want to make the launch event as big as the release is.\n\nAre Efforts Being Made to Create a Particl Documentary?\nNot at this time.\n\nIs Particl’s Treasurer Buying PART at These Prices?\nNo. The Particl team doesn’t hold any coin, the Particl Foundation does. The\nFoundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s\naccounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.\n\nWill Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?\nWe have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking\nfor improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes\nsense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our\nshort-term vision or requirements for the moment.\n\nWill Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?\nAs Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more\ninvolved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing.\nHe puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the\ndevelopment and the business management/organizational side of the project goes\non smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.\n\nWhen Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?\nIt’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle\nfirst on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be,\nwe’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think\nwill have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header\nneeds to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling\nmore important tasks.\n\nWe again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and\noffering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!\n\nDoes Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?\nYes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals\nright now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a\nhandful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we\nwant to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more\nestablished exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask\npointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved.\nThere’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange,\nincluding looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it\nbenefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.\n\nIt does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful\nthey are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space\nrather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.\n\nHave Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?\nNo, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but\neach exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is\nbeing considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those\nask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not\nbelieve the impact to be big enough for Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Testnet Marketplace Builds Available\nMarketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nParticl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and\ninterface experiences to Particl…\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\n\nListing governance has been added to the marketplaceOn Tuesday, we released new\nmarketplace testnet builds.

A few items have been moved around and some\nwere added to the report. For example, the report shows a new Particl Desktop\nfeature, adjustable ring size value, is now completed. It also shows that all of\nthe Settings features have now been moved to the Waiting for Review category,\nmeaning they are just about to be included in future public testnet builds.\n\nPrivate MarketsOne quite interesting development in the past two weeks have been\nthe layouts for the coming private markets and listings feature that will be\nincluded in the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace. A screenshot of\nthe Private Markets page has been shared this week, and more exist. We will\nrelease more of them when we are sure that they aren’t going to be changed\nbefore actual implementation.\n\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 is Out — Fixes Ledger Issues for MacOS Users\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 Released — Fixes Ledger Issues on MacOS\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nYesterday, we released Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been…\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\n\nWe’ve also released on the same Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been experiencing.\n\nIn other words, you shouldn’t have any issue anymore when trying to use your\nLedger hardware device on MacOS.

This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it unprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale. Taking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for spammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds contained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many strategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and that we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult “Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces, decentralized or not.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-the-marketplace-coming-on-mainnet\"><strong>When is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-HwPakrwxuZXK7Viru1THcQ.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)</figcaption></figure><p>Particl Marketplace Alpha is already out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds this week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it out, scroll down to the <em>News &#x26; Updates </em>section of this Community Update to find the link to the blog post containing the builds.</p><p>The requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly decentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet, and RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features such as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first version of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet Beta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the mainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.</p><p>As we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop), each of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving deadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of them having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the month of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which will also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of any kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone know when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as it should.</p><h3 id=\"when-s-the-ringct-hardfork\">When’s the RingCT Hardfork?</h3><p>RingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve decided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our implementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than Cryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA. Note that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code as they requested.</p><p>The requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to be fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on mainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it. This should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and update their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact that both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either automatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is updated to the latest version.</p><h3 id=\"any-plans-on-presenting-attending-events\">Any plans on Presenting/Attending Events?</h3><p>Yes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of November for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused on development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the Communications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the road to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone meeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is going to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great opportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.</p><p>One of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series of meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like to organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be sponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience and then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot of similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person in November and really finalize that launch strategy.</p><p>We’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as it relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had community member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also received a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup which is already in the works.</p><p>It’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely diligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to properly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more details about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.</p><h3 id=\"what-efforts-are-made-to-attract-a-public-figure-for-particl\">What Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?</h3><p>At the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to represent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we raise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.</p><p>That being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly encourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any serious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it local meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step up, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve you!</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-launch-event\">Will There Be a Launch Event?</h3><p>Absolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be launching the marketplace on mainnet live. I’d be a great way to reveal the marketplace to a large audience and get exposure from big players, investors, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We have a lot of ideas for this launch event and we are quite excited to craft an exciting and fun launch strategy. The mainnet release of Particl Marketplace is a huge milestone for the Particl project, and we want to make the launch event as big as the release is.</p><h3 id=\"are-efforts-being-made-to-create-a-particl-documentary\">Are Efforts Being Made to Create a Particl Documentary?</h3><p>Not at this time.</p><h3 id=\"is-particl-s-treasurer-buying-part-at-these-prices\">Is Particl’s Treasurer Buying PART at These Prices?</h3><p>No. The Particl team doesn’t hold any coin, the Particl Foundation does. The Foundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s accounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-consider-changing-its-setup-and-switch-to-a-two-token-mechanism\">Will Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?</h3><p>We have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking for improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes sense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our short-term vision or requirements for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"will-ryno-be-actively-coding-on-particl\">Will Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?</h3><p>As Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more involved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing. He puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the development and the business management/organizational side of the project goes on smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.</p><h3 id=\"when-will-the-bitcointalk-thread-be-updated\">When Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?</h3><p>It’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle first on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be, we’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think will have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header needs to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling more important tasks.</p><p>We again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and offering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!</p><h3 id=\"does-particl-plan-on-getting-on-more-exchanges\">Does Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?</h3><p>Yes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals right now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a handful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we want to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more established exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask pointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved. There’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange, including looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it benefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.</p><p>It does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful they are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space rather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.</p><h3 id=\"have-funds-been-made-available-for-the-binance-application\">Have Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?</h3><p>No, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but each exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is being considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those ask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not believe the impact to be big enough for Particl.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-testnet-marketplace-builds-available\">New Testnet Marketplace Builds Available</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><strong>Marketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><em>Particl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and interface experiences to Particl…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-WnAqX3iaOMTJzurtdTn0LQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Listing governance has been added to the marketplace</figcaption></figure><p>On Tuesday, we released new marketplace testnet builds.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
