This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing\nmoderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core\nvalues of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden\non users.\n\nBuilt using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It\nanalyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models,\nrequiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your\ndata stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively\nto Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing\nenvironment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or\nvirtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.\n\nYou can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: \nhttps://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\n\nHow We Got Here: The Current Moderation System\nThis release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system\n(v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users'\nhands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the\nplatform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and\npro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.\n\nThe current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some\nconceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial\ndifferences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users\nencounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the\napplication, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public\nlist where the community can either support the original flag through additional\ndownvotes or contest it with upvotes.\n\nContent removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary\ndecisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of\nParticl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply\nof 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000\ncoins to be removed.\n\nImportantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since\nParticl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple\naddresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the\nvoting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated\nwithin an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote\ncarries.\n\nAddressing Current Limitations\nWhile this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its\ncontinued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:\n\nFirst, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain\neffective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can\nlead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.\n\nSecond, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must\nbe exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it.\nWhile early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary\ntrade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant\nbarrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.\n\nThese challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to\ndecentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving\nthe marketplace experience.\n\nThe Promise of Local LLM Technology\nThe breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology.\nWhile the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT,\nAnthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's\nprivacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean\nhigher total API costs.\n\nIndeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models.\nThese models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving\naccuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever\nconnecting to third-party service providers.\n\nThis technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve\nParticl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without\ncompromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through\nAPIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced\nscaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.\n\nThe New Automated Moderation Script\nGitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered\ncontent moderation script for Particl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without\nconnections to 3rd-parties.Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for\nParticl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without connections to 3rd-parties. -\ncryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-scriptGitHubcryptoguard\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script]We’re proud to\nintroduce, today, a new script that automates the process of moderating Particl\nMarketplace content with minimal user input.\n\nOperating Modes\nThe script offers two distinct approaches to marketplace moderation: manual mode \nand continuous mode.\n\nScript's main menuIn manual mode, you maintain complete control through a CLI menu interface that\nlets you oversee each step of the process. This gives you the ability to review\nand adjust moderation decisions before they reach the network, making it\nespecially valuable during your initial setup phase or when testing new\nmoderation rules.\n\nOptions for the script's manual modeContinuous mode transforms this process into an autonomous operation. The script\nindependently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings,\nanalyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the\nnetwork. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace\nscan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces\nuser exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only\nafter thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.\n\nRule System and Analysis\nAt the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule\nsystem powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor\nmarketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria.\nEach rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving\nyou precise control over the moderation process.\n\nThe system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language\ndescriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters.\nTo help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules\naccessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing\nimmediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can\nuse them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or\nentirely replace them with custom rules of your own.\n\nFor those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of\ntest listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to\nprohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the\ntest. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules\nbefore deploying them in the live marketplace.\n\nThe Judgement Engine\nProcessed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely\nuser-defined)The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to\ncontent analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and\ndescriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than\nusing potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when\nclassifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true',\n'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible\nand unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without\npredetermined assumptions.\n\nModel Selection and Performance\nAfter extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the\noptimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates\nremarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including\nseveral state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being\nvictim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it\nto run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to\nvirtual private servers.\n\nOur commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making\neffective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge.\nWe're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to\nfurther optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains\nunclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if\nany.\n\nWallet Configuration\nThe script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin controlTo operate\neffectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an\nactive Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up\nyour wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.\n\nThe first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which\nstreamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a\nParticl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves\nspecifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and\ninitializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and\nNode Settings/Initialize Wallet).\n\nThe initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It\nincorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling\nsecure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for\nboth accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system.\nWithout proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings\nor cast votes on content.\n\nVote Broadcasting System\nThe process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach\ndesigned to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the\nfirst time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the\nLLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu,\nwhere you can examine each decision in detail.\n\nDuring this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated\ndecisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves\nparticularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique\ncontent patterns.\n\nOnce satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting\nprocess through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in\nyour wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins\ncontained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically,\nensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the\nintegrity of your voting decisions.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use this application without running a local model? \nA: Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU\nnetwork running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option\nin the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider\navailability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the\ncommunity-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation\nperformance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this\nspace for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent\ncompromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its\nminimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like\nRaspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.\n\nQ: How is my data and privacy protected? \nA: Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script\nconnects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data\ncollection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision\nencoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which\naddresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy\nand data security principles, which guided the script's development.\n\nQ: What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? \nA: Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we\nemphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new\nmoderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until\nyou're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides\nan excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM\ninterprets different content types.\n\nQ: Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? \nA: Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority.\nBuilt using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The\ninstallation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all\ndependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's\nexisting Python packages or other software.\n\nQ: What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous\nmode? \nA: The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it\nto resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will\nautomatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime,\nensuring no content goes unprocessed.\n\nQ: How much storage space does the local LLM model require? \nA: The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The\nscript's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies,\nneed roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about\n2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to\naccommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.\n\nQ: What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? \nA: For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:\n\n * RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)\n * Storage: 6GB free space\n * Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity\n\nNote: The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be\nsignificantly reduced.\n\nQ: How does the script handle network connectivity issues? \nA: The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the\nmarketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at\nregular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored\nlocally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and\nprocesses any listings it missed during the downtime.\n\nQ: Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? \nA: Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their\nown wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each\ninstance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool\naccording to its wallet's stake.\n\nQ: How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? \nA: The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config\ndirectory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the\nrules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or\nused to recover your setup if needed.\n\nQ: Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data? \nA: No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond\nthe expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings\nthan what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided\ntest listings (available from the CLI menu).\n\nQ: How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? \nA: LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and\ninitiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become\navailable, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided\nthat you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).\n\nLooking Forward\nThe release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in\ndecentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve\neffective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy,\ndecentralization, and user autonomy.\n\nThis development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It\nshows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while\nminimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized\ncontrol. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and\nits privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other\ndecentralized projects facing similar challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community\nfeedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the\npotential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates,\nand further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even\nmore efficient and user-friendly.\n\nYour feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this\ntool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in\ndecentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with\ndifferent rules, and share your experiences with the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU network running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option in the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider availability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the community-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation performance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this space for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent compromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its minimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like Raspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is my data and privacy protected? <br><strong>A:</strong> Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script connects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data collection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision encoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which addresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy and data security principles, which guided the script's development.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? <br><strong>A:</strong> Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we emphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new moderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until you're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides an excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM interprets different content types.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority. Built using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The installation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all dependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's existing Python packages or other software.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous mode? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it to resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing moderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core values of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden on users.</p><p>Built using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It analyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models, requiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your data stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively to Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing environment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or virtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.</p><p><strong>You can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\">https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script</a></strong></p><h2 id=\"how-we-got-here-the-current-moderation-system\"><strong>How We Got Here: The Current Moderation System</strong></h2><p>This release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system (v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users' hands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the platform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and pro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p><p>The current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some conceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial differences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users encounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the application, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public list where the community can either support the original flag through additional downvotes or contest it with upvotes.</p><p>Content removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary decisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of Particl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply of 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000 coins to be removed.</p><p>Importantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since Particl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple addresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the voting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated within an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote carries.</p><h2 id=\"addressing-current-limitations\"><strong>Addressing Current Limitations</strong></h2><p>While this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its continued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:</p><p>First, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain effective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can lead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.</p><p>Second, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must be exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it. While early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary trade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant barrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.</p><p>These challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to decentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving the marketplace experience.</p><h2 id=\"the-promise-of-local-llm-technology\"><strong>The Promise of Local LLM Technology</strong></h2><p>The breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology. While the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean higher total API costs.</p><p>Indeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models. These models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving accuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever connecting to third-party service providers.</p><p>This technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve Particl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without compromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through APIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced scaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.</p><h1 id=\"the-new-automated-moderation-script\">The New Automated Moderation Script</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for Particl Marketplace.

The script independently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings, analyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the network. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace scan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces user exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only after thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.</p><h3 id=\"rule-system-and-analysis\"><strong>Rule System and Analysis</strong></h3><p>At the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule system powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor marketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria. Each rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving you precise control over the moderation process.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BGhzhwa8wQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Automated and LLM-powered marketplace content moderation script\"></iframe></figure><p>The system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language descriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters. To help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules accessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing immediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can use them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or entirely replace them with custom rules of your own.</p><p>For those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of test listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to prohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the test. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules before deploying them in the live marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"the-judgement-engine\"><strong>The Judgement Engine</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2024/11/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2024/11/image-6.png 600w, /glink/2024/11/image-6.png 671w\"><figcaption><em>Processed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely user-defined)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to content analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and descriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than using potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when classifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true', 'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible and unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without predetermined assumptions.</p><h3 id=\"model-selection-and-performance\"><strong>Model Selection and Performance</strong></h3><p>After extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the optimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates remarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including several state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being victim of strong bias during training).

When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nAutomated Marketplace Content Moderation ?\nDecentralized Moderation Meets Local AIDiscover the new automated, LLM-powered\nParticl Marketplace moderation script.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]Earlier today, we\npublished the open-source code for the automated, LLM-powered Particl\nMarketplace content moderation script. \n\nThis helper script, which aims to streamline marketplace moderation by shifting\nthe moderation burden from end-users to more engaged community members (though\nend-users can still participate in content moderate as before), is built using\nPython and is available across Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms.\n\nFor detailed insights into the system's architecture, check out our latest blog\npost here [https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]. Ready\nto get started? The setup guide is available in our Github README here\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script/blob/master/README.md]\n.\n\nWe encourage you to try this new proactive moderation approach and share your\nfeedback. We're particularly excited about how this solution bridges two\ntransformative technologies - cryptocurrencies and LLMs - to address the complex\nchallenge of unbiased content moderation in decentralized systems.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nWe've continued assisting mainnet-pat with his Bitcoin Cash integration into\nBasicSwap, notably focusing on a few edge cases and the \"mercy path\". \n\nYou can keep track of some of the development on that end by monitoring\nTecnovert's fork of BasicSwap (here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/bch_staging/]), which serves as\na testing ground for features and updates that will later on make it to the\nofficial BasicSwap repository.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWe have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer following\nextensive testing this week. However, we haven't been able to release it just\nyet, though we expect it to go live very shortly.\n\nFor context, we've adopted a new approach to the setup wizard that simplifies\nits flow and handles the installation process differently. This redesign aims to\nreduce potential failures that can occur across various Windows configurations.\n\nNew Display Type for Orders ?\nAs part of BasicSwap's current development cycle, we're reimagining the order\nbook display by introducing a new visualization option for available offers.\n\nWhile continuing to source data from the same network offers, the new interface\nwill more closely resemble traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. It will feature\na depth chart and a structured order book that displays both buy and sell offers\nin ascending order on opposite sides.\n\nThis enhancement aims to align BasicSwap's user experience with conventional\ntrading platforms, bridging the gap between atomic swap technology's benefits\nand the accessibility needed to achieve widespread adoption.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1855017656576839694]Don't miss our upcoming\nPrivacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX and Firo this coming\n20th of November at 9:00 AM EST!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

plan to proceed with the\nrelease early next week.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nGeneral ✅\nWe've been looking into a few bugs and issues, notably as we've been\ninvestigating a bug reported by the community.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
