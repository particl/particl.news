Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!\nUnlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be\nentirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this\ndifficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal\nprivacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata\nstripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the\nfuture, including Dandelion++ [https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging\n(using SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html] and\neventually more scalable and leading-edge DSNs\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \nsuch as Loopix\n[https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181]\n, IPFS [https://ipfs.io/], and etc), and much more. With all the data leaks and\nhacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \n(link to case for privacy)\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f].\n\nFurthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed\nvery effective blockchain tracking software that makes tracking public\ncryptocurrency transactions quite trivial\n[https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/]\n. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain\nthan say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with\nprivacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private\nblockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the “if you have nothing to hide,\nyou don’t really need privacy” kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people\nrealize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people.\nPlus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private\nenvironment, which they’ll want to use a solution that’s been designed with this\nas a prime aspect.\n\nBut why does that even matter?\nAs broken down in an earlier article of mine\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f],\nprivacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days\nwhere privacy was associated to people who had “things to hide”.\n\n> In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like \nEquifax\n[https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/a-year-after-the-equifax-data-breach-what-if-nothing-changes-02062051]\n, Facebook\n[http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/facebook-data-sharing-privacy-mobile-companies-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-5208703/]\n, Deloitte [http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/deloitte-hack/], Yahoo\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-dataprotection-yahoo/yahoos-eu-regulator-orders-privacy-changes-over-data-breach-idUSKCN1J32JX]\n, FedEx\n[https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3026819/thousands-of-fedex-customers-private-information-exposed-in-legacy-server-data-breach]\n, Uber [http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/uber-data-breach-security/], Under Armour\n[https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/another-fitness-app-exposes-users-data-a-11055] \nor even Pizza Hut\n[http://www.information-age.com/pizza-hut-suffers-data-breach-123469137/], the\npoor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts,\nthe public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within\nthe last couple of years.\nThe Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\nNowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust\nwith their personal data. In light of…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\n\nBreaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to\nfight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not\nrespect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just\nas bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask?\nBecause blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed,\ntransactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and\nfor vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want\neveryone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold,\ninformation that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized\nmarketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not\nwant anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.\n\nParticl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not\nneed to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything\nhappens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from\na public blockchain.\n\nBuilt as a 100% Decentralized & Trustless Solution\nAnother advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100%\ndecentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just\nas an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by\nSyscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be\nsomeone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead\nto bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact\nthat a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute.\nTalking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay,\nfor example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even\nwhen it shouldn’t.\n\nOn Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow\nis based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep\nboth parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace\nitself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or\ngroup of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with\neither vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the\noriginal, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the\nfirst place.\n\nFun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100%\ntrustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about\nit in some Bitcoin’s repository?\n\nMuch Better & Intuitive User Interface\nParticl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use\nin mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to\nunderstand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said\nof most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or\nbarebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.\n\nAdditionally, Particl plans on developing a web & mobile interface at some point\nin the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about\nit. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as\neasy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile\ninterface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the\nroadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the\nmainnet release of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace AlphaDownload Particl Marketplace Alpha here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\n\nMore recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel: \nhttps://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\n\nParticl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace\nIn the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a\nfull-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its\nroadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer\nout there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a\nsocial media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even\nthe addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will\ntruly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nThe goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms\nlike Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can\nall be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something\nakin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an\nAndroid OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop\nwallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the\nParticl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right\ninto it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp\nplatforms which are generally pretty barebone).\n\nOne of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only\ndecentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure\nsurrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce\ninfrastructure on which the coin can be spent).\n\nTop-Tier Development Team\nThe Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed\nranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (\nhttps://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked\n36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code\nquality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and\nmarketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl\nteam is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach\naccomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking\n(Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with\nSegwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin\ncodebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2\nwith 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin\nitself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though\nthey were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team\nthat is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security\nand decentralization.\n\nTo see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github\nvisualization videos included in this blog post: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\n\nMany Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist\nAs we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or\nalmost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community.\nSame thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and\netc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I\nthink we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors\nwon’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their\npotential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all\nco-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry.\nThis is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can\noffer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for\nsale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they\nare not alone in this space.\n\nWhat I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized\nmarketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand.\nAs such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the\nvalue of Particl considerably. That is because:\n\n * Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they\n   use another coin)\n * More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, \n   up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow as the\n   buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor\n   also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to\n   hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.\n * A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out\n   at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of\n   circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very\n   interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get\n   100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of\n   the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the\n   community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction.\n   Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus\n   anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming\n   staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of\n   holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.\n * Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency.\n   Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the\n   background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting\n   other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It\n   doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!\n\nThe four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized\nmarketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie,\neven a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally\nincrease the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is\none of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their\ncoins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).\n\nThird-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)\nAnother big thing about Particl too is that Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/], a\ndecentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on\nimplementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the\nmarketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and\nwill offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on\nParticl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user\n(read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user\nexperience is no different than eBay), customer support & product returns,\nshipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional\nmeans of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat\npayment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.\n\nMubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second\nmarketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview\nI conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with\nOpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have\nflaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with\nParticl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its\nplatform.\n\nInterview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface & Suite of Services Designed\nfor Particl…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\nA few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder\nof\nMubiz, a decentralized marketplace…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\n\nMubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will\nmake Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will\nbe making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn\nallowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their\ncompetitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and\ncheaper prices for the customer.

In light of…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Breaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to fight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not respect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just as bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask? Because blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed, transactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and for vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want everyone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold, information that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized marketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not want anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.</p><p>Particl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not need to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything happens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from a public blockchain.</p><h2 id=\"built-as-a-100-decentralized-trustless-solution\">Built as a 100% Decentralized &amp; Trustless Solution</h2><p>Another advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100% decentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just as an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by Syscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be someone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead to bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact that a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute. Talking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay, for example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even when it shouldn’t.</p><p>On Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow is based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep both parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace itself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or group of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with either vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the original, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the first place.</p><p>Fun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100% trustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about it in some Bitcoin’s repository?</p><h2 id=\"much-better-intuitive-user-interface\">Much Better &amp; Intuitive User Interface</h2><p>Particl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use in mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to understand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said of most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or barebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.</p><p>Additionally, Particl plans on developing a web &amp; mobile interface at some point in the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about it. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as easy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile interface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the roadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/What-Makes-Particl-s-Decentralized-Marketplace-Stand-Out-From-its-Competition/0-He_sNQBVTbkHxxHw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Download Particl Marketplace Alpha here: </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha</a></p><p><em><strong>More recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel:</strong></em> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\">https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc</a></p><h2 id=\"particl-is-much-more-than-a-decentralized-marketplace\">Particl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace</h2><p>In the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a full-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace.</p><p>The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone).</p><p>One of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent).</p><h2 id=\"top-tier-development-team\">Top-Tier Development Team</h2><p>The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (<a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\"><strong>https://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa</strong></a>) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization.</p><p>To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\">https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfhGfmuLjo8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"many-decentralized-marketplaces-could-and-probably-will-co-exist\">Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist</h2><p>As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space.</p><p>What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because:</p><ul><li>Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin)</li><li>More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, <strong>up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow</strong> as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.</li><li>A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction. Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.</li><li>Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency. Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!</li></ul><p>The four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized marketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie, even a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally increase the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is one of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their coins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).</p><h2 id=\"third-party-building-on-the-particl-protocol-mubiz-\">Third-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)</h2><p>Another big thing about Particl too is that <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a>, a decentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on implementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the marketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and will offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on Particl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user (read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user experience is no different than eBay), customer support &amp; product returns, shipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional means of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat payment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.</p><p>Mubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second marketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview I conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with OpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have flaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with Particl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><strong>Interview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface &amp; Suite of Services Designed for Particl…</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><em>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder of Mubiz, a decentralized marketplace…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Mubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will make Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will be making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn allowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their competitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and cheaper prices for the customer. Surely this should be an attractive solution for most?</p><hr><p>In the end, I think the current bear market in the cryptocurrency scene will make people realize the importance of intrinsic value. What if you take speculation out of the equation? Does that make your favorite coin or token worthless or not?</p><p>This is what makes me so positive about Particl’s future. Its coin has great economics, the technology is top of the line within the crypto industry, and the project is securely funded for quite some time, with a second funding round that should occur next year. Could Particl end up being in a <em>perfect storm<strong> </strong></em>scenario at some point in the future?</p><hr><p><em><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>The information contained herein is not intended to be a source of advice or credit analysis with respect to the material presented, and the information and/or documents contained in this blog post do not constitute investment advice.

While this isn’t currently part of the roadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/What-Makes-Particl-s-Decentralized-Marketplace-Stand-Out-From-its-Competition/0-He_sNQBVTbkHxxHw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Download Particl Marketplace Alpha here: </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha</a></p><p><em><strong>More recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel:</strong></em> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\">https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc</a></p><h2 id=\"particl-is-much-more-than-a-decentralized-marketplace\">Particl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace</h2><p>In the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a full-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace.</p><p>The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone).</p><p>One of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent).</p><h2 id=\"top-tier-development-team\">Top-Tier Development Team</h2><p>The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (<a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\"><strong>https://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa</strong></a>) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization.</p><p>To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\">https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfhGfmuLjo8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"many-decentralized-marketplaces-could-and-probably-will-co-exist\">Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist</h2><p>As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space.</p><p>What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because:</p><ul><li>Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin)</li><li>More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, <strong>up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow</strong> as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.</li><li>A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction. Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.</li><li>Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency. Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!</li></ul><p>The four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized marketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie, even a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally increase the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is one of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their coins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).</p><h2 id=\"third-party-building-on-the-particl-protocol-mubiz-\">Third-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)</h2><p>Another big thing about Particl too is that <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a>, a decentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on implementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the marketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and will offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on Particl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user (read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user experience is no different than eBay), customer support &#x26; product returns, shipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional means of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat payment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.</p><p>Mubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second marketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview I conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with OpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have flaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with Particl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><strong>Interview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface &#x26; Suite of Services Designed for Particl…</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><em>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder of Mubiz, a decentralized marketplace…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Mubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will make Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will be making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn allowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their competitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and cheaper prices for the customer. Surely this should be an attractive solution for most?</p><hr><p>In the end, I think the current bear market in the cryptocurrency scene will make people realize the importance of intrinsic value. What if you take speculation out of the equation? Does that make your favorite coin or token worthless or not?</p><p>This is what makes me so positive about Particl’s future. Its coin has great economics, the technology is top of the line within the crypto industry, and the project is securely funded for quite some time, with a second funding round that should occur next year. Could Particl end up being in a <em>perfect storm<strong> </strong></em>scenario at some point in the future?</p><hr><p><em><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>The information contained herein is not intended to be a source of advice or credit analysis with respect to the material presented, and the information and/or documents contained in this blog post do not constitute investment advice.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
