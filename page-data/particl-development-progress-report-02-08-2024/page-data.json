This\nis our current focus as the portion of the work relating to the LLM logic is now\ncomplete and awaiting the delivery of the scanner.\n\nOnce completed, the next step will be to merge it with the marketplace-related\ncomponent of the system, and then test it extensively before release.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've continued with work on improvements to the user interface, including an\nimprovement to the rate system and how coin prices are fetched. The upcoming\nupdate will also contain a full redesign of the new offer page, a redesign of\nthe current \"swaps in progress\" page, a new index page, as well as the inclusion\nof better defined \"terms and conditions\" (taken from BasicSwap's website here\n[https://basicswapdex.com/terms]) that the users will have to accept after\nsetting up BasicSwap for the first time. \n\nAdditionally, we're working on a series of general changes and improvements to\nthe codebase, such as a more distributed API key management system.\n\nThese updates will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, you'll be able to\ntest these changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nSince coming back from the 2024 Litecoin Summit, we've started designing the\nintegration layer that will make it possible to integrate swap capabilities into\nthird-party applications or on the web.\n\nWhile actual coding hasn't officially started, we expect to begin within a few\ndays as we iron out the last few details. This item is the next major milestone\nfor BasicSwap and will dramatically improve its user experience by making it\nmore intuitive and easy to use via leverage of third-party applications such as\nalready-established crypto wallets or fully integrated web platforms.\n\nAs always, we're designing this integration layer in such a way that will\npreserve decentralization and privacy as much as possible, as per the usual\nethos that comes with BasicSwap and Particl. \n\nAdditionally, working on this integration layer will carry the additional\nbenefit of completing several milestones identified in community contributor\nOfrnxmr's proposal here\n[https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/457].\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nDon't miss our upcoming Privacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX\nand Firo this coming 5th of August at 9:00 AM EST as we discuss Zcash funding\noperations and improvements, among other topics!\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/_PIVX/status/1819360462598795374]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have completed development of a market listing scanner that enables the new,\nimproved moderation system to extract relevant information and feed it into a\ndistributed network of Large Language Model (LLM) for moderation purposes.\n\nOur current focus is now on integrating the two systems — the market scanner and\nthe LLM-powered moderation tool. Once this integration is complete, we will be\nready to deploy the new system.\n\nIt's important to note that the new moderation tool is entirely optional; no\nuser will be required to run it nor will it come pre-packaged with or\nenabled-by-default in Particl Core. Additionally, moderation policies are fully\ncustomizable and are set by the individual user running an instance of this\nsystem. These policies are defined using natural language, thus allowing for a\nvery intuitive setup.\n\nWe want to emphasize that our team does not, and will not, enforce specific\nmoderation policies or maintain a ban list. Decentralization is a fundamental\nprinciple in everything we do at Particl, and we are committed to upholding this\nvalue.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe're gearing up to push a minor update in the next day or two that will fix a\nfew bugs and include a few improvements, notably to the display of QR codes in\nsome cases.\n\nFuthermore, we're hoping for a release of the larger GUI update we've been\nworking on for the past few weeks somewhere next week, if all goes well.\n\nThis larger update will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, and you'll\nbe able to test the changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\nThe smaller update, however, will be available directly from the master branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe're currently exploring a new, alternative messaging protocol for the purpose\nof integrating BasicSwap into third-party applications more easily as well as to\nprovide a fallback solution to SMSG in cases where it wouldn't scale enough\n(e.g., a sudden massive spike in the number of swaps).\n\nThis research is part of our ongoing efforts in building BasicSwap's integration\nlayer, which is the next major milestone for the DEX and the Particl ecosystem\nas a whole. \n\nIn the interest of deploying integratable BasicSwap-powered solutions to\npartners more quickly, we are considering a phased approach. For instance, this\nstrategy may involve initially enabling UTXO <> UTXO swaps using HTLC (\"Secret\nHash\") atomic swaps, followed by a gradual implementation of the broader range\nof features and capabilities offered by BasicSwap over time.\n\nIt's important to note that, while we do have individual components required for\nthis integration layer either in place or at various stages of development, we\nare still in the early phases of this process. We have not yet fully\ntransitioned out of the R&D phase, and so, we may end up iterating these\ncomponents as we progress. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This\nis our current focus as the portion of the work relating to the LLM logic is now\ncomplete and awaiting the delivery of the scanner.\n\nOnce completed, the next step will be to merge it with the marketplace-related\ncomponent of the system, and then test it extensively before release.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've continued with work on improvements to the user interface, including an\nimprovement to the rate system and how coin prices are fetched.\n\nThese updates will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, you'll be able to\ntest these changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\n\nWindows Setup Wizard v3.1 Pre-Released ?‍♂️\nRelease BasicSwap (BSX) Installer v3.1.0-PRE-WIN ·\ngerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUIBasicSwap (BSX) Installer v3.1.0\nPRE-RELEASE FOR TESTING.CHANGELOG: Added Wownero.Rewrite/Refactored the\nPowershell scripts.Removed protobuff.Fixed stuck 70% with dependencies.Fixed\nGPG\nbug....GitHubgerlofvanek\n[https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases/tag/WIN-v3.1.0]\nAlso this week, we've pushed an update to the V3 version of the GUI Windows\nsetup wizard, which fixes a couple of issues encountered by users.\n\nHere's the changelog for the 3.1 version:\n\n * Fixed GPG bug\n * Added additional extra error checks\n * Disabled DASH/PIVX for now until fix applied\n * Fixed .bat files\n\nBasicSwap at the Litecoin Summit ?️\nDr. Kap, Cryptoguard, and other BasicSwap contributors met in Nashville for the\n2024 edition of the Litecoin Summit in which Dr. Kap gave a presentation on\nBasicSwap and the upcoming MWEB swap compatibility. \n\nThe event was a resounding success, both for the Litecoin Foundation for hosting\nsuch a stellar event, but also for BasicSwap.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
