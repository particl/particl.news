[https://particl.io/roadmap/]\nIn the past two weeks, we’ve taken a deep dive into Particl’s current status.\nWe’ve reviewed all of last year’s accomplishments for the project\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] and how its\nOpen Marketplace has evolved since being released\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02] on\nmainnet in August 2019. If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl\nis moving full steam ahead!\n\nHowever, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming\namount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important\nfact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting\nblockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering\nnew and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it\nneeds to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real\nworld”.\n\nLuckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in\nmentality from hype to real-world use-cases is precisely where the blockchain\nindustry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful.\n\nIndeed, the project’s current team [https://particl.io/team] and advisory board\n[https://particl.io/team] are composed of old-school crypto developers,\nlong-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in\nblockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt\nglobal eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking\nout the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible\nwhen relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.\n\nIn other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because\nblockchain is the new cool kid in town. No, it’s because its novel technology is\nbound to have a profound impact on an industry (eCommerce) in dire need of\nimprovements.\n\nThe Path Towards a Greater Adoption of Particl’s Marketplace\nParticl’s Open Marketplace may be live on mainnet, but it’s still Beta software.\nFor that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features,\nor seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s\nall normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after\nBeta).\n\nTo that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in\nits current form have been identified in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430].\n\n * Missing features\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\nThe good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things\nbecause it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, \nquite to the contrary\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d]\n. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.\n\nThat’s precisely with “making Particl adoption-ready” in mind that the Particl\nteam is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and\nbeyond! What’s scheduled to be improved? What features are planned to be\nintegrated? Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of\nthis article!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe New Roadmap is Here!\nParticl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers\nto entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, \neach roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in\ndetail in the Why? section of the roadmap.\n\nTo better plan ahead, it has also been separated into three different\ncategories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features,\nInnovators and Early Adopters. Each phase targets different types of users and\nhas its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items,\nit is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents,\nby user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.\n\nThe more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more\nlikely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also\nmakes the onboarding process increasingly easier.\n\nBefore getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important\npoints:\n\n * The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or\n   see their scope change at any time.\n * There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team\n   plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided,\n   at least for the moment.\n * The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any\n   particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t\n   necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.\n * The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the\n   Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These\n   will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.\n * While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and\n   UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an\n   ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020\nand beyond!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore Marketplace Layer / Key Features\nThis stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due\nto the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and\navailable features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but\nstill lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract\nnew users. At that stage, the entire project is still considered experimental\nand probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta. Even though\nthe marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (and\nthanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ? \n).\n\nMore information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have\nrecently been posted on Particl.news (1\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], 2\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02], 3\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430]).\n\nThe key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of\nmarkets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of\nthat for next to no fee.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInnovators Stage of Adoption\nIf you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is\nwhen it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of\norganic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will\nslowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of\npeople.\n\n“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and\nhave generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate\nabout new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users\nthat start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to\nignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e.\ngiving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know\nwill improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart\nParticl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.\n\nIn the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is\nlikely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and\nparticipants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because\nthey can’t find it elsewhere).\n\nThis phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly\ninteresting ones:\n\n * The fine-tuning of the Escrow (rate, optionality, …)\n * The possibility to run decentralized private auctions\n * A messaging system between buyers and sellers\n * The development SDK (for developers)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarly Adopters Phase of Adoption\nAfter the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early\nadopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher\nthan innovators.\n\nInstead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a\nvery urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as\nproviding them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other\nplatforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all\nsorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new\ntechnologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know\nthe rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them. Whereas innovators tend\nto be fine rushing in, testing out the platform, and help find its pain points,\nearly adopters expect a much more “adoption-ready” platform with as little\nproblems as possible (although they do expect the platform to not be 100%\nready).\n\nIn the specific case of Particl, this stage will likely attract the more\naggressive and opportunistic types of sellers and enterprises. This phase is\nmuch closer to being mainstream-ready, although it is not quite there yet.\n\n> Note: This section of the roadmap is preliminary. More items will be added to it\nas we inch closer to this phase of adoption.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Note\nIf you would like to help with Particl’s development and contribute to one of\nthe items within the roadmap, feel free to contact the team on any of the\nchannels available (Telegram, Discord, Riot, Reddit, etc) or by email\n[http://particl.io/team/].\n\nIf you would instead like to help out on getting new users onboard, then feel\nfree to contact Cryptoguard on any of the channels available (Telegram, Discord,\nRiot, Reddit, etc).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-zT-RLkPxcPnGTA0LSE5X8A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-decade-new-way-to-do-ecommerce-\">New Decade, New Way to do eCommerce! ?</h3><blockquote><a href=\"https://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>Want to see the new development roadmap right now?

They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know the rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them.

But that doesn’t mean there is no system to keep both parties honest in\nplace.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users.

In other words, users of the marketplace are as anonymous as\nthe current privacy technologies of today allow you to be.\n\nTrusting the Other Party\nHowever, the combination of all the marketplace’s characteristics mentioned\nabove introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to trusting the other party\n(whether that be the buyer or the seller) when making a transaction on the\nmarketplace.\n\nOn traditional, centralized marketplaces, this isn’t the biggest of deals, at\nleast from the customer point of view. In fact, these platforms either have a\n“resolution center” in place or an escrow system where users can be assured that\nthe other party will behave honestly.

That means there’s no\nstaff around to arbitrate issues and make sure all transacting parties are\nhonest between each other.\n\nSo then, how can you prevent the other party from not respecting their end of\nthe deal when their identity is private and when there is no central party that\ncan punish bad actors? Does the buyer send the payment first, and then hope his\nproduct arrives in a good shape, if at all? Or does the seller take the risk to\nship the item before receiving the payment? This all boils down to trust, and\ntrusting strangers on the web, especially when they use bleeding-edge privacy\ntechnologies\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd], has\nalways proven to be risky and, frankly, ill-advised.\n\nThat’s where Particl’s innovative dual deposit MAD escrow system comes into\nplay.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDual Deposit MAD Escrow System\nLike most marketplaces, Particl uses an escrow system to keep transacting\nparties honest. The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the\nsystem used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s \ncompletely trustless, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary\nto have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also \nfree of use, private-by-default, and fully autonomous between the buyer and the\nseller.\n\nAn escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one,\nit dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all\ntransaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and\nany other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two\ntransacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside\nparty looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no\nservices being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the\nescrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction\nand makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep\nhiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’\nschedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e.\nOpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).\n\nSo how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one\nanother without any third-party enforcing honesty?\n\nDual Deposits\nIn order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving\ndishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place.\nTypically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the\nmoderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and\nscrew one of the parties unfairly (hint: eCommerce platforms will almost always\nrule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller\n[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay]).\n\nOn Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms\nof dual deposits and game-theory.\n\nThe way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty\neffective. In a nutshell, when making a marketplace transaction, both parties\n(the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow\nsmart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the\nshipping costs. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in\nthe game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been\ncompleted satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party,\nat no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.\n\nTo visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth\n$100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110\nwhich is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and\nanother $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full\nand without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other\nhand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be\nfunding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be\nshipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means\nboth parties now have $220 on the line.\n\nWhile the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to\npackage and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s\ngoing to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the\ntransaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the\ntransaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both\nparties.\n\nMutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory\nThe reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves\nor tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the\ntransaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security\ndeposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security\ndeposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be\nsatisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the\nagreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.\n\nThis dynamic is often referred to as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction]. It is a well-known\nwar doctrine\n[https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/] \nbased on game-theory. The theory stipulates that if two countries are in\npossession of nuclear weapons, they won’t use them against each other. The\nreason for that is pretty simple — if one country launches a nuke towards the\nother party, it is almost guaranteed that the other country will retaliate and\nlaunch a nuke as well. The end scenario is that both countries will essentially\nannihilate each other with highly damaging weapons. In other words, both\ncountries lose and get turned into dust, hence why this game-theory is called \nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nThe effectiveness of that game-theory was on full display, in a real-world\nscenario, during the Cold War when both the US and Russia heavily threatened\neach other with nuclear warheads. Missiles were very visibly targeted at each\nrival country, but never was a nuclear attack initiated due to the fear of\nretaliation from the other country.\n\nHow Does That Theory Tie In With Particl’s Escrow System?\nParticl’s escrow is more of the same, only the game-theory doesn’t revolve\naround the use of nukes, but around financial losses. The important point to\nunderstand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that\nif one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence\nthe “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl,\nthat negative incentive is a net financial loss.\n\nIn fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive\ntheir security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s\nprecisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work\ntowards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of\nintermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds,\nand no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can\nsuccessfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for\nthe usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or\nbusiness-related data to any outside party or intermediary.\n\nThis model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no\noutside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between\nthe two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply\nchains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved\nwants a third-party to snoop in. There’s no account details being revealed to an\nescrow agent, no transaction history being looked at, no tracking number or\nshipping address being looked at, no conversation being logged, and so on.\nEqually as important, there’s also nothing traceable or identifiable being\npublicly written on the blockchain.\n\nPrivacy\nProbably the most powerful feature of this entire escrow mechanism is the fact\nthat all currency transactions are initiated using the powerful RingCT privacy\nprotocol. The escrow smart-contract itself works using the Confidential\nTransactions (CT) privacy protocol, but any incoming and outgoing transactions\nto it are done with RingCT. Check out this Particl Explained — Private\nTransactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef] \narticle for more details about how CT and RingCT transactions can be linked\ntogether.\n\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\n\nAnd because all transactions that occur on the marketplace have to go through\nthe escrow system, it means they’re all untraceable by design.\n\nThis ensures all marketplace transactions are fungible and as private as the\nnext one.

The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the system used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s <strong>completely trustless</strong>, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary to have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also <strong>free of use</strong>,<strong> private-by-default</strong>, and <strong>fully autonomous</strong> between the buyer and the seller.</p><p>An escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one, it dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all transaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and any other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two transacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside party looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no services being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the escrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction and makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep hiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’ schedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e. OpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).</p><p>So how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one another without any third-party enforcing honesty?</p><h3 id=\"dual-deposits\">Dual Deposits</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-83zap8l7onknenEufi6rAg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving dishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place. Typically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the moderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and screw one of the parties unfairly (hint: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay\"><strong>eCommerce platforms will almost always rule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller</strong></a>).</p><p>On Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms of <strong>dual deposits</strong> and <strong>game-theory</strong>.</p><p>The way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty effective. In a nutshell, <strong>when making a marketplace transaction, both parties (the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow smart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the shipping costs</strong>. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in the game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been completed satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party, at no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.</p><p>To visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth $100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110 which is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and another $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full and without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other hand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be funding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be shipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means both parties now have $220 on the line.</p><p>While the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to package and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s going to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the transaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the transaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both parties.</p><h3 id=\"mutually-assured-destruction-mad-game-theory\">Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves or tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the transaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security deposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security deposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be satisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the agreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.</p><p>This dynamic is often referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\"><em><strong>Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</strong></em></a>. It is a <a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/\">well-known war doctrine</a> based on game-theory. The theory stipulates that if two countries are in possession of nuclear weapons, they won’t use them against each other. The reason for that is pretty simple — if one country launches a nuke towards the other party, it is almost guaranteed that the other country will retaliate and launch a nuke as well. The end scenario is that both countries will essentially annihilate each other with highly damaging weapons. In other words, both countries lose and get turned into dust, hence why this game-theory is called <em>Mutually Assured Destruction</em>.</p><p>The effectiveness of that game-theory was on full display, in a real-world scenario, during the Cold War when both the US and Russia heavily threatened each other with nuclear warheads. Missiles were very visibly targeted at each rival country, but never was a nuclear attack initiated due to the fear of retaliation from the other country.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-that-theory-tie-in-with-particl-s-escrow-system\">How Does That Theory Tie In With Particl’s Escrow System?</h3><p>Particl’s escrow is more of the same, only the game-theory doesn’t revolve around the use of nukes, but around financial losses. The important point to understand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that if one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence the “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl, that negative incentive is a net financial loss.</p><p>In fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive their security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s precisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work towards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of intermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds, and no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can successfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or business-related data to any outside party or intermediary.</p><p>This model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no outside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between the two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply chains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved wants a third-party to snoop in. There’s no account details being revealed to an escrow agent, no transaction history being looked at, no tracking number or shipping address being looked at, no conversation being logged, and so on. Equally as important, there’s also nothing traceable or identifiable being publicly written on the blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h3><p>Probably the most powerful feature of this entire escrow mechanism is the fact that all currency transactions are initiated using the powerful RingCT privacy protocol. The escrow smart-contract itself works using the Confidential Transactions (CT) privacy protocol, but any incoming and outgoing transactions to it are done with RingCT.

✅\nOver the last few days, we’ve reviewed Particl’s past development\naccomplishments with a full 2019 development review\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] as well as a \nsummary of all the progress made on the Open Marketplace since its mainnet\nrelease\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02].\n\nAs is pretty evident, the development of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been\npretty strong and consistent throughout 2019, but that’s really been the\nproject’s greatest strength ever since its launch in mid-2017.\n\nParticl’s 2019 Year in Review\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819]\nThe Year the Dream Came Trueparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819]\n\nHowever, there’s one very important fact to consider — great development only\ntakes you so far. This isn’t early crypto anymore when innovative projects were\nrewarded with exposure and growth simply based on development accomplishments.\nIn reality, what the blockchain community is still looking for, even after all\nthese years, is the metaphorical “killer app”, that first blockchain product\nthat will significantly improve on something concrete and bring the masses on\nboard. In other words, it is looking for blockchain to cause a paradigm shift.\n\nIn fact, the crypto community has more or less “seen it all”, especially\nconsidering the large number of projects that have fundraised millions of\ndollars based on bold promises but haven’t delivered a single thing yet. And\neven those projects that have delivered live blockchain products have seen very\nlittle adoption from anyone outside the few crypto hobbyists. The reason for\nthat is actually pretty simple — crypto’s “killer app” is still missing and\nnowhere to be found.\n\n“Isn’t Particl THE Killer App”?\nWith that in mind, many within Particl’s community would be fast to point out\nthat Particl’s Open Marketplace is just that — crypto’s killer app. After all,\nit offers a LOT of benefits that simply cannot, by design, be offered by the\nmore traditional online marketplaces currently in existence…and that’s all\nthanks to blockchain and distributed technologies. It charges no commission and \nbarely any fee at all, is inherently private by default, provably secures your\ndata by completely getting rid of third-parties, requires no sign-up, no login, \nno personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works\nfrom anywhere in the world as long as you can connect to the internet. In fewer\nwords, it completely redefines the very nature of eCommerce by taking it through\nthe evolutionary path and making it much better. And that simply wouldn’t be\npossible without blockchain and the other novel distributed technologies\nemployed by the Particl platform.\n\nSo why isn’t Particl getting more adoption? Why isn’t Particl the new hot\nmarketplace on the web? To understand why that is, it is important to look at it\nfrom a different perspective, one that’s not coming from a hardcore\ncryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nThis is precisely what this article is going to breakdown. What are the\nmarketplace’s current pain points? What are some of its obstacles to adoption\nstill standing to this day? How can these be fixed or eliminated so that any\neffort towards user adoption starts yielding positive results? Get prepared,\nbecause this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new\ndevelopment roadmap. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning\nbehind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving\nforward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?\nWarning Banner Header on Particl DesktopBefore getting into the finer details,\nwe first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace\nis still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its\ntesting/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s\ntrue even though it is currently running on mainnet.\n\nWhile Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out\nthere, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live\nblockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final\nversion. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case,\nthink in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real\nchallenge.\n\nThat, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption\ncompared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still\ndefinitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers.\nOnly once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant\nincrease in the levels of adoption.\n\nBut the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace\nadoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix\nwhat makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start\nreaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka\nthe number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.\n\nWhat are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?\nThe first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand\nwhat’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s\nmissing? To that end, the Particl team has recently received a feedback report\nfrom a very prominent crypto company\n[https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7] \nwhich ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl\nteam itself.\n\nAs it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different\ncategories:\n\n * Missing features\n\nBecause Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way \nfeature complete [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete]. That means a\nlot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be\ntools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make\nbetter-informed purchasing decisions, etc.\n\nAnd while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important\ndevelopment phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing\nthe base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl\nwas first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load\nof very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure\nof the marketplace the same way Market Management will.\n\nAnd even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they\nprobably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us\nto the second category…\n\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n\nReleasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it\nneeds to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major\nrefactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet\non the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to\nsignificantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and\nwill also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you\nlearn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of\nParticl’s marketplace components…\n\nAs time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features\nand functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released,\nis called “refactoring [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]”. Code\nrefactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch\ncomponents also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make\nsure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a\nbig pile of spaghetti code [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code].\n\nBut more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already\nout or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they\nbecome user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different\nphases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding\nmore functionalities and efficiency in following updates.\n\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n\nSometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are\nnot directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be\nthe whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these\nchanges are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it\ndefinitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general\nimprovements.\n\nThose improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what\nmakes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes\nloading times shorter, etc.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex\nto be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready\nto market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be\nappropriately integrated and feel right before it can be considered as ready.\n\nConsidering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web,\nand also because most people access those with pretty decent internet\nconnections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both\nsellers and buyers now more than ever. Even more so, users will generally be\nwilling to spend a little more if it means simpler and more pleasant user\nexperience. Which leads us to the fourth and final category…\n\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\n“UI/UX is everything”, or so… Referring to the previous statement, “users will\ngenerally be willing to spend a little more if it means a simpler and more\npleasant user experience”.\n\nOf course, UI/UX is not the only thing that matters, but it is what glues\neverything together so that it makes sense and just feels right. You can have\nall the features in the world, but if they are displayed confusingly or\nunpleasantly, people will generally not even bother. That becomes even truer as\na product’s learning curve gets steeper.\n\nThe reason behind this is mostly due to time constraints and the over-saturation\nof options available to users. Especially in the case of marketplaces — there\nare hundreds, if not thousands of them. Even if a marketplace’s value\nproposition is significant, it’s pretty hard to change people’s habits and get\nthem to move from a marketplace they know and feel comfortable using to one that\nis complicated to understand and doesn’t look as good (it’s pretty fair to\nsay…looks do matter).\n\nSo, is Particl’s Open Marketplace complicated to use? The answer might be “no”\nto you, but be assured it’s probably a resounding “YES” for most people you\nknow. So how do you make these people leap forward and into this new age for\nonline marketplaces? You gotta make sure that each of these 4 categories is\nbeing taken care of by the development team and bring the marketplace to a point\nthat it may finally be considered “adoption-ready”.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, Let’s Tackle Those Issues!\nNow that we know where lies the adoption hurdles for Particl’s Open Marketplace,\nit’s now time to strategize and plan around those. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a brand new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond. With adoption in\nmind, each of the roadmap items has been carefully selected to eliminate what\nwould make people not want to use the marketplace. There is one specific reason\nbehind each of these items.\n\nIt’s important to understand, though, that the 4 categories mentioned above are\ntightly intertwined. For example, you can’t spend too much time on UI/UX when\nthe marketplace may still significantly change structure as it will with the\nintegration of Market Management. But you should still do a little, as long as\nyou keep development hours wastes at a minimum. This is why Particl’s\ndevelopment team is focusing on these 4 categories as the underlying line of\nthinking behind the new roadmap’s content.\n\nThe Time to Reveal the New Roadmap is NOW ?\nYes indeed, the time to reveal the new roadmap has arrived! We now know just \nhow\nmuch has been done in 2019\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], how far has\nthe marketplace has progressed since releasing on mainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02],\nand what are the reasons it’s not been getting more adoption up until now. We\nare now equipped with all the tools to fully understand the reasoning behind the\nitems included in the new roadmap.\n\nWith that being said, you can safely expect the new roadmap to be revealed next\nweek, with its full and detailed breakdown being published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news].\n\nAs Market Management comes out in the next few weeks and with the new roadmap\ngiving a clear indication of the way forward for the project, the entire Particl\nteam is more than excited for what lies ahead of us all.

Get prepared, because <strong>this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new development roadmap</strong>. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning behind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving forward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-the-marketplace-s-current-stage-of-development\">What’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Way-Forward/1-1pWgQdPqD1Tgk3FBk2oKQw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Warning Banner Header on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>Before getting into the finer details, we first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace is still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its testing/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s true even though it is currently running on mainnet.</p><p>While Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out there, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live blockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final version. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case, think in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real challenge.</p><p>That, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption compared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still definitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers. Only once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant increase in the levels of adoption.</p><p>But the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace adoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix what makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start reaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka the number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-marketplace-s-current-pain-points\">What are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?</h2><p>The first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand what’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s missing? To that end, <a href=\"https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7\"><strong>the Particl team has recently received a feedback report from a very prominent crypto company</strong></a> which ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl team itself.</p><p>As it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li></ul><p>Because Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete\"><strong>feature complete</strong></a>. That means a lot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be tools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make better-informed purchasing decisions, etc.</p><p>And while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important development phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing the base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl was first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load of very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure of the marketplace the same way Market Management will.</p><p>And even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they probably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us to the second category…</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li></ul><p>Releasing a feature is something.

The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption.

In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
