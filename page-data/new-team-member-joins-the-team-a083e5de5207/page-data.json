Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWhen is the RingCT and governance hardfork is going to happen?\nThere is no official date set for it yet, and the plan to combine RingCT and\ngovernance into the same hardfork hasn’t changed since we last spoke about it.\nTecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability,\nperformance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on\nmainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and\nso it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.\n\nDoes the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when\nthey are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and\ncan’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?\nIn short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a\ngood idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins\nand then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency.\nThis isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or\nimplemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus\nis mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note\nthat we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test,\nresearching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry,\nmeaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest\npriority.\n\nOne interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl\nMarketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and\nrequires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually\nlock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers\nneed to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’\nhonesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked.\nContrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply\nlocked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive,\nas everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a\nperfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up\nfor an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to\nbe more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future,\nmore Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock\neven more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed\nSDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire\nlarge sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior\nis akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).\n\nLooking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any\ndocumentation or internal chats?\nNo, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except\nfor Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately\n(as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of\nCharlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages.\nLike any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some\nmisbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead\ndeciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty\nconclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made\nagainst him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his\nbrand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.\n\nWill Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges\nlike Binance?\nIt seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community\nand chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to\ntimes regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this\nmay not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general\nthat this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are\nactually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s\nhappening surrounding the project.\n\nRight now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance,\nbut also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large\nexchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing\nfee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community\ngrowth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund\nmanagement strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds\nfor development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional\nfunding round will be in sight).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nStatus Report\nParticl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nAs always, a new Status Report was published at the same time we did our last\nlivestream.

As always, Tecnovert is still\nworking on improving the RingCT implementation with enhancements and \nBulletproofs. The current team meeting in South Africa is likely to shape future\nStatus Report and further the internal roadmap.\n\nConferences & Meetups\n> \nAs we have been saying lately, our intention is to start getting a more direct\nexposure by directly reaching out to the most passionate individuals of the\ncrypto scene by getting a better exposure at various crypto events. Nothing\nbeats the human interaction of discussing in-person the subject we are all\npassionate about!\n\n> \nOur newest team member, Lina Seiche, was specifically hired with this in mind\nand has already started integrating Particl into the blockchain presentations\nshe had already scheduled. Because she is seemingly falling in love with\nParticl, and also because of her own company, block-chats\n[https://block-chats.com/], it is to be expected that Particl will now be\nintegrated into most of their events, in some way or the other, in addition to\nthe Particl-themed events she’ll be organizing.\n\nAs such, she’s started planning the first of many future Particl-themed events.\nIn fact, on the 14th of December, Particl is going to hold its first official\nevent in Manilla, Philippines. This Christmas-themed Particl event will not only\nfocus on Particl but will also hold a panel of experts and well-known blockchain\npublic figures in that region. The panel will focus on eCommerce and why it is\nin dire need of decentralization and will be composed of leaders in the\nPhilippines blockchain industry such as:\n\n * Miguel Cuneta — Co-Founder of SCI [https://sci.ph/] & Particl Advisor\n * Mark Vernon — Founder of TagCash [https://tagcash.com/], a large\n   Philippines-based crypto company and very well-known within the Asian\n   community\n * Chris Verceles — Blockchain developer at Consensys [https://consensys.net/]\n * Colin Goltra — Head of Cryptocurrency Program at Coin.ph [https://coins.ph/]\n * Gerb Inajada — Head of Blockchain Technology at UnionBank\n   [https://www.unionbank.com/]\n * Alenna Dawn Magpantay — Philippines Ambassador for Coding Girls\n   [https://www.coding-girls.com/]\n\nFor more information about this event, please follow these links: \nhttps://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/ & \nhttps://www.meetup.com/BlockChatsPhilippines/events/256492831/\n\nWe’ve also have been reaching out to our key contacts within the French\ncommunity and are planning a meetup/conference in Paris shortly. We will give\nmore information about this one at a future time.\n\nParticl Chosen to Present at the Toronto CryptoCamp Blockchain Unconference\nHome [https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\nToronto | 29.11.18 Crypto camp Get your tickets!\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]www.cryptocamp.community\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\n\nParticl has been chosen among 80 applications to present its Particl Marketplace\nproduct at the Blockchain Unconference in Toronto on the 29th of November.\n\n> CryptoCamp is Toronto’s first-ever blockchain unconference. This\n100%-volunteer-led event aims to bring the entire blockchain community together,\nshowcase some of the most interesting products and projects, and pay it forward\nby offering Blockchain Bootcamp workshops. Organized by the community for the\ncommunity, CryptoCamp aims to grow, connect, and diversify the ecosystem. Come\nto meet other crypto-curious and crypto-scaredies, and connect with\nprofessionals working in this space. This event is for you.\nThis conference is mainly focused on two things: education, and the presentation\nof actual products making use of the blockchain technology. This event will be\nhosted at the Deloitte Office in Toronto and will take place over two entire\nfloors.\n\nThe first part of the day will be dedicated to education. In fact, many speakers\nwill give educational talks about crypto and blockchain technology in general to\na wide audience of crypto enthusiasts. The second part of the day, which is when\nwe are scheduled to present Particl Marketplace to the crowd, is focused on\nshowcasing actual blockchain products. In fact, a series of speakers will each\nbe demonstrating their blockchain products in front of experts in the field and\nexplain how they foresee it making an impact on the industry they’re each\ntargeting. With around 80 submitted applications or so, the event has chosen\nParticl as one of the projects it wants to see presented!\n\nTickets for the entire event are available at this link\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-camp-at-deloitte-tickets-51716842468#tickets]\n, and we hope to have the chance to meet some of you who live close to Toronto.\nThis event is organized in part by CryptoChicks, a rather well-known blockchain\ngroup in Canada, and has partnered with several key sponsors such as Deloitte,\nShyft, BlockGeeks, TWG, and many more to make it a memorable moment. If you’re\naround the area and would like to come, let us know in advance so that we can\nmeet up at some point!\n\nSee the full list of speakers here: https://www.cryptocamp.community/speakers/\n\nDevelopment Team Meeting in South Africa\nThe team is currently meeting near Elizabeth Port in South Africa for its\nquarterly meeting. This time, instead of solely focusing on development\nstrategy, the team has also invited most of the communications team to join the\nmeeting and further develop the marketplace launch strategy and communications\nstrategy moving forward. Topics to be discussed include the coming release of\nParticl Marketplace, the coming funding round, the internal development roadmap,\nand many other topics. We will keep you updated as we go, of course!\n\nAdditional Links\nBitcoinAfrica.io Interview with Desi-Rae\n[https://bitcoinafrica.io/2018/11/07/interview-cryptoramble-particl-project/]\n\nNodesOfValue Interview with CryptoBeans\n[https://nodesofvalue.com/particl-passive-income-from-staking-and-decentralized-market-listing-fees/]\n\nNew Desi-Rae Video:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe wish you all a good week and don’t forget to follow our particl.news\n[http://particl.news] page to not miss any update and #BePART of our great \nDiscord [https://discord.gg/CQNZDN] community!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--11/1-VEFKKynh55H3sZAgvQbcFQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Did you miss our last AMA/FAQ livestream on Youtube?

Tecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability, performance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on mainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and so it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.</p><h3 id=\"does-the-particl-team-plans-on-integrating-a-lock-up-time-for-part-coins-when-they-are-unlocked-for-staking-so-that-coins-are-locked-for-a-longer-time-and-can-t-be-moved-staked-sold-before-your-node-finds-a-block\">Does the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when they are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and can’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?</h3><p>In short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a good idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins and then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake protocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency. This isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or implemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus is mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note that we have a Research &amp; Development team constantly putting up to test, researching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry, meaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest priority.</p><p>One interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl Marketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and requires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually lock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).</p><h3 id=\"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats\">Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?</h3><p>No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of Charlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages. Like any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some misbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead deciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty conclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made against him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his brand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-hire-a-market-maker-and-make-deals-with-bigger-exchanges-like-binance\">Will Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges like Binance?</h3><p>It seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community and chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to times regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this may not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general that this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are actually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s happening surrounding the project.</p><p>Right now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance, but also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large exchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing fee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community growth) on our investment.

In fact, a series of speakers will each be demonstrating their blockchain products in front of experts in the field and explain how they foresee it making an impact on the industry they’re each targeting. <strong>With around 80 submitted applications</strong> or so, the event has chosen Particl as one of the projects it wants to see presented!</p><p>Tickets for the entire event are available at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-camp-at-deloitte-tickets-51716842468#tickets\"><strong>this link</strong></a>, and we hope to have the chance to meet some of you who live close to Toronto. This event is organized in part by CryptoChicks, a rather well-known blockchain group in Canada, and has partnered with several key sponsors such as Deloitte, Shyft, BlockGeeks, TWG, and many more to make it a memorable moment.

Tecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability, performance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on mainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and so it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"does-the-particl-team-plans-on-integrating-a-lock-up-time-for-part-coins-when-they-are-unlocked-for-staking-so-that-coins-are-locked-for-a-longer-time-and-can-t-be-moved-staked-sold-before-your-node-finds-a-block"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Does the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when they are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and can’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a good idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins and then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake protocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency. This isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or implemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus is mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note that we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test, researching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry, meaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest priority."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl Marketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and requires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually lock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of Charlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages. Like any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some misbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead deciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty conclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made against him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his brand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"will-particl-hire-a-market-maker-and-make-deals-with-bigger-exchanges-like-binance"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Will Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges like Binance?"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community and chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to times regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish.

Don’t worry, this update should keep you up to speed with all\nthe latest developments and news surrounding the project!\n\nYou also don’t want to miss the News & Updates part of this Community Update as\nwe’ll reveal some details about Particl’s new team member, Lina!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nNote: This edition of the AMA/FAQ livestream features Arnold Bansemer as a\nguest. Some of the answers to the questions included in this summary have been\nparaphrased and shortened to fit with the Community Update format. Please refer\nto the provided timestamps for the exact answer from Arnold himself!\n\n(2:34 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=154]) Arnold Bansemer Introduces Himself\n“I’ve taken over from Kewde as Lead Developer for Particl Desktop, however, I\nstill refer back to him from time to time as he’s been a huge part of building\nParticl Desktop, so he’s not entirely relieved from its “duty”. What I mostly do\nis code reviews, manage merge and pull requests as well as help other developers\nwhen they have difficulties or issues with some specific tasks. I also have my\nown development workload, of course.”\n\n(3:56 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=236]) Are you only working on Particl\nDesktop or do you also work on the marketplace?\n“If my help is required, I’ll always be there to assist the marketplace\ndevelopers. As a matter of fact, I’ve already submitted some PRs (pull requests)\nabout it, although I am still finding my way myself through the marketplace\ncode. In fact, there’s a lot of code done on Particl Marketplace! The\nMarketplace Team is also very strong and experienced and I don’t think I’m\nneeded that much to assist them, but if there is a need I’ll be there!”\n\n(6:20 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=380]) Is there any update on the cold\nstaking pool?\nThe cold staking pools are more or less ready to be released. If you are already\non the #testing channel on Riot or Discord, you can see Tecnovert has already\nmade the code publicly available. Not only has the code been made available, but\ntesting as well. In fact, in the #testing channel were posted instructions on\nhow to test the staking pool on both testnet and mainnet networks. The more\ntesters we get, the quicker we can identify and fix issues and get it officially\nreleased.\n\nSneak peek of the cold staking pool’s user interfaceIt’s important to note that\nthe publicly available staking pools do not have any GUI interface and are very\nbarebone. While the GUI has been under development for some time now, it will\nonly be available on the official launch day of the staking pools.\n\nThe code itself is not hosted under Particl’s Github account, just like\nDasource’s Partyman cold staking app. The code for the cold staking pools is\nhosted under Tecnovert’s personal account here: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool. We encourage everyone to\ntest, study, tweak, or fork the code if they want to.\n\nKeep an eye out for any update about cold staking pools in the coming weeks!\n\n(10:21 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=621]) Arnold, what’s your fresh\nperspective of the project?\n“One thing that particularly stood out when I first joined the Particl project\nis the passion, dedication, and technical skills of the team members. I can even\nsay that at first, I was a little bit intimidated by that as everyone really is\non top of their game, I was wondering how I would measure up to them. There is\nso much that has been accomplished code wise and it’s pretty impressive. I can\nsay this is what really stood out for me as a new team member.”\n\n(12:41 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=760]) What do you think the project is\n“behind”?\n“As far as what we are behind with…well we are always “generally behind” when it\ncomes to any project development. It’s a bit difficult to put into perspective\nbecause there’s a lot of work to be done, but we’re also moving as fast as we\ncan given the size of the team. I don’t see, however, any particular aspect of\nthe project that is specifically behind other aspects or being neglected. We’re\nstill on track to wrap up governance this month, and probably get Beta ready for\nthe next month or so. One thing we gotta be careful about though is to finish\nwhat we start working on first before implementing new features/functions, or\nelse it becomes hard to finish things up properly. I think we’ve been pretty\ngood on that end though.”\n\n(14:50 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=884]) As a new team member, did you\nfeel welcome?\n“Yes, but it’s a bit different than what I am used to. I come from the more\ntraditional 9 to 5 job model where you work in an office and have a set\nschedule. Usually, during your first day at the office, you are directly\nintroduced to everyone you’ll be working with and so it is easy to get to know\nyour new co-workers quickly.\n\nParticl being a decentralized team, it’s a bit different. You kind of have to\nmake the first steps because everyone is so busy and caught up in their work.\nThere’s also the fact that most conversations happen over text in chat, so it’s\nnot as easy to get to know your new co-workers as an in-office job. But yes, I\ndid feel welcome, and so far most team members have been willing to sacrifice\nsome of their time to chat a little and get to me know better!”\n\n(17:14 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1034]) Are you going to the South Africa\ntrimestrial team meeting?\n“Yes, I’ll be there! I actually live in South Africa so it won’t be difficult\nfor me to get where the meetings are. I’ll surely be taking part in some of the\ndeveloper meetings and will be there to finally meet the rest of the team in\nperson! This will definitely be beneficial to get together, in person, to flesh\nout ideas in a more direct way than over chats or conference calls!”\n\n(19:40) What would you say to others who may want to join the development? Would\nyou recommend it?\n“I can’t comment on what the Foundation does and who they hire, but I definitely\nrecommend participating from a community contribution perspective. Do it,\nplease, it’s important and helps a lot! This is a community project and\ncontributions are welcomed in more than one way. If you’ve got an idea for a\nfeature or just a general proposal, then, by all means, log it on Github or code\nit up then submit a pull request. I’ll definitely review it for integration and\nit might just make it if the review is positive. We’ll never say no to\ncontributions, especially as we have a small team. There’s only so much we can\ndo at a given time. Right now, we’re really busy with the marketplace code. If\nthere’s something that’s not within our immediate focus, you can contribute and\nwe will look into each submission for sure!”\n\n(22:19 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1339]) What’s your opinion on the few\nbugs identified on the latest Particl Marketplace Alpha builds?\n“A couple of them are easy fixes and have already fixed in internal builds.\nThere have been, however, one or two bugs that have been trickier in fixing,\nnotably due to reproduction issues (recreating the bug internally) and figuring\nout how they’re happening. We’re making good progress on them though, especially\non the [object Object] issue lots of people have been having.\n\nIn most cases, the fixes are pretty simple, it’s more about figuring about how\nthe bugs are generated and not breaking anything else while fixing them. That's\npretty much what automated test cases are for, and I think we need to have more\nof them. It’s one of the goals we’re all currently working towards at the same\ntime as shown in the status report. Also, as mentioned before, more community\ntesters definitely helps to identify and troubleshoot these issues.”\n\n(25:22 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1522]) Will you guys put new testnet\nbuilds out now that the download links have expired?\n“What we’re trying to avoid with the 10-day expiry limit on download links is\nthe number of available bugs out there. We don’t want people using old builds\nand reporting bugs and issues that have already been fixed in new releases.\nThere’s also a second aspect to it in that we ideally want to include new stuff\nfor the community to test everytime we do new releases to keep it interesting to\nthe community to keep the number of testers high! There should be a new testnet\nbuild coming out soon so keep an eye on the #testing channel!”\n\n(28:07 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1687]) You mentioned in your interview\nwith Cryptoguard that you were excited about future use-cases, features, and\nDapps for Particl. Do you have any idea on top of your head you can share?\n“I’ve actually been discussing with Cryptoguard in private chats the other day\nideas we and other people from the community and team have had over time.\nThere’s a couple of them floating around, but currently, the main focus really\nis about getting the marketplace up and we need to push that hard. We’re\nhesitant to mention anything specific at the moment because we don’t want to\nswitch the focus on other stuff.\n\nWhat really excites me in that regard though is that there are many ideas out\nthere that would be possible to implement. Getting ideas from the community is\nwhat we need to go forward, and is a great mental exercise to identify what we\nneed to focus on next after the marketplace. For the moment, I won’t elaborate\ntoo much and keep that for after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace!”\n\n(30:44 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1844]) What are your thoughts on the\npotential of the coming developer SDK? How do you see Particl as a decentralized\nand privacy-focused economy rather than just a currency?\n“That’s extremely important to have that baseline of privacy, and then\neverything built on top of that is beneficial. Getting the community involved as\nwell, in the long run, is going to really push the project forward and will\nprobably be the driver for mass adoption. There’s already going to be the\nmarketplace available, but taking it beyond that is really going to transform\nthe GUI (Particl Desktop) into essentially a platform with a similar approach to\na plugin-based platform architecture. Whether future Dapps and features are\ndeveloped by us or by the community…I really believe this is going to be the\ndriving force for mass adoption!”\n\n(33:30 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2010]) Has Particl been your introduction\nto blockchain development?\n“My very very first introduction to cryptocurrencies was back in 2011–2012 when\nI first heard about it. I didn’t really know about it at the time and kind of\npushed it to the side to see what would happen before I do anything about it.\nThen, one of the companies I was working with started to look into crypto and\nthat’s when I really could evaluate what was happening in the space. That’s\naround the time I first bought Bitcoin as well as some other coins. But strictly\nrelated to actual development, yes, Particl is my first crypto project as a\ndeveloper.”\n\n(36:07 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2167]) What’s your favorite topping on\na pizza?\n“I’m born carnivorous, so any kind of meat is welcomed on pizza, especially\nbacon! Also, I’m in the more controversial side of the debate…but pineapple can\ndefinitely work on a pizza.”\n\n(39:01 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2341]) Paul, Does Particl plans on\ncreating a two-token system to reduce the volatility of funds held in escrow?\n“There’s no immediate plan for this. That being said, that doesn’t it won’t ever\nhappen, but as Arnold said, it’s important to focus on one thing at a thing and\nnot spread ourselves too thin, otherwise, lots of stuff get started but few of\nthem actually get finished up. We are actually going to consider various\nsolutions to reduce volatility and a two-token system might be part of the\nsolution, but it’s not part of the current roadmap.”\n\n(41:46) Will the official website be updated in time for the mainnet release of\nthe marketplace?\n“Yes, the website is constantly in evolution since we launched Particl. We’re\nalso in contact with HackerBay, a German-based company focused on communication\nand marketing, among other things, to help improve the way our message is being\ncommunicated.\n\nWe are currently working on a page specifically made for the marketplace and\nwill update the rest of the website accordingly.”\n\n—\n\nIf you want to read more questions and answers from Arnold, please head over to\nthe link below and read Cryptoguard’s interview with him!\n\nInterview with Arnold Bansemer, Particl Desktop’s Lead Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\nBack in August, the Particl team was very excited to welcome Arnold Bansemer as\nthe new Particl Desktop Lead Developer…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Team Member Joins the Rank\nLast weekend, we’ve teased pictures of a mystery woman hanging out with Miguel\nCuneta [https://twitter.com/MiguelCuneta/status/1056727461990289409], CCO and\nCo-Founder at Satoshi Citadel Industries and Particl advisor. Now’s the time to\nreveal a bit more about Lina, Particl’s newest team member!\n\n> Originally from Germany, Lina is a former\nYoutube-singer-turned-blockchain-advocate — with a few stations in\nbetween.Scouted online by a Japanese artist, she made the move to Asia to\nundergo extensive studies in music, language, and business administration,\neventually turning to the latter to become chief manager at a Kuala Lumpur-based\nmanagement company. Her entrance into the blockchain industry came through her\nposition as the PR Manager and Evangelist for a Tokyo-founded cryptocurrency\nhedge fund platform where she would break down language barriers launching\nglobal roadshows and marketing activities.\n\nHer extensive experience in PR management and event organization is going to\nhelp the project a lot. Particl will also benefit from her skills as a public\nspeaker, writer, event organizer, and much more. We are already bouncing many\nevent ideas and, with Lina, you can expect Particl to start gaining more “boots\non the ground” exposure at conferences and meetups all around the world!\n\nLina will introduce herself to the community next week with a video, you\ndefinitely want to keep your eyes open for that!\n\nStatus Report Updated\nParticl.io — StatusReport [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl is an open source, decentralized privacy platform. Built for global\nperson to person and business to person… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nWhile the team is currently mostly busy working on finalizing the governance\nsystem with coin weights, building the private markets, and fixing the various\nissues identified by community testers of the last Particl Marketplace Alpha\nbuild, an interesting item has popped up in the newest Status Report: the\nability to view a list of reported items to cast a vote. This feature will allow\nusers to quickly access listings that have previously been flagged by other\nusers and either vote them as undesirable or not undesirable. This should\nincrease the number of votes cast, thus making the reporting more accurate.\n\nzDEX Alpha is Live With Particl\nzDEX, a privacy-focused decentralized exchange using PIVX’s second-tier network,\nhas launched its Alpha (testnet) version with Particl as one of its 6 first\ncoins to be made available. Make sure to visit zDEX’s website\n[http://www.zdex.exchange/] and test this promising exchange!\n\nSupply lock up\nIn the last few weeks, there have been interesting discussions on Discord and\nTelegram as to how Particl’s MAD escrow system is going to reduce the\ncirculating supply of the PART coin.\n\nIn fact, as the escrow system generally requires the buyer to pay for an item,\nmake a security deposit equal to the value of the purchased order, and have the\nvendor also make an equal-value security deposit, it can be estimated that, in\naverage, three times the value of an item is locked in escrow for a certain\nduration (until both parties agree the transaction is done).\n\nIf we are to estimate that an escrow could take on average 14 days to complete\n(the time it takes to process, package, ship, and receive an order), then it is\npossible to estimate the total amount of money, in PART, locked out of\ncirculation at any given time.\n\nTo not miss any of these interesting discussions, join our of our chatrooms on\neither Discord, Telegram, or Riot.

I can even say that at first, I was a little bit intimidated by that as everyone really is on top of their game, I was wondering how I would measure up to them. There is so much that has been accomplished code wise and it’s pretty impressive. I can say this is what really stood out for me as a new team member.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-12-41-what-do-you-think-the-project-is-behind-\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=760\">12:41</a>) What do you think the project is “behind”?</h3><p><em>“As far as what we are behind with…well we are always “generally behind” when it comes to any project development. It’s a bit difficult to put into perspective because there’s a lot of work to be done, but we’re also moving as fast as we can given the size of the team. I don’t see, however, any particular aspect of the project that is specifically behind other aspects or being neglected. We’re still on track to wrap up governance this month, and probably get Beta ready for the next month or so. One thing we gotta be careful about though is to finish what we start working on first before implementing new features/functions, or else it becomes hard to finish things up properly. I think we’ve been pretty good on that end though.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-14-50-as-a-new-team-member-did-you-feel-welcome\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=884\">14:50</a>) As a new team member, did you feel welcome?</h3><p><em>“Yes, but it’s a bit different than what I am used to. I come from the more traditional 9 to 5 job model where you work in an office and have a set schedule. Usually, during your first day at the office, you are directly introduced to everyone you’ll be working with and so it is easy to get to know your new co-workers quickly.</em></p><p><em>Particl being a decentralized team, it’s a bit different. You kind of have to make the first steps because everyone is so busy and caught up in their work. There’s also the fact that most conversations happen over text in chat, so it’s not as easy to get to know your new co-workers as an in-office job. But yes, I did feel welcome, and so far most team members have been willing to sacrifice some of their time to chat a little and get to me know better!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-17-14-are-you-going-to-the-south-africa-trimestrial-team-meeting\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1034\">17:14</a>) Are you going to the South Africa trimestrial team meeting?</h3><p><em>“Yes, I’ll be there! I actually live in South Africa so it won’t be difficult for me to get where the meetings are. I’ll surely be taking part in some of the developer meetings and will be there to finally meet the rest of the team in person! This will definitely be beneficial to get together, in person, to flesh out ideas in a more direct way than over chats or conference calls!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-19-40-what-would-you-say-to-others-who-may-want-to-join-the-development-would-you-recommend-it\">(19:40) What would you say to others who may want to join the development? Would you recommend it?</h3><p><em>“I can’t comment on what the Foundation does and who they hire, but I definitely recommend participating from a community contribution perspective. Do it, please, it’s important and helps a lot! This is a community project and contributions are welcomed in more than one way. If you’ve got an idea for a feature or just a general proposal, then, by all means, log it on Github or code it up then submit a pull request. I’ll definitely review it for integration and it might just make it if the review is positive. We’ll never say no to contributions, especially as we have a small team. There’s only so much we can do at a given time. Right now, we’re really busy with the marketplace code.

There have been, however, one or two bugs that have been trickier in fixing, notably due to reproduction issues (recreating the bug internally) and figuring out how they’re happening. We’re making good progress on them though, especially on the [object Object] issue lots of people have been having.</em></p><p><em>In most cases, the fixes are pretty simple, it’s more about figuring about how the bugs are generated and not breaking anything else while fixing them. That's pretty much what automated test cases are for, and I think we need to have more of them. It’s one of the goals we’re all currently working towards at the same time as shown in the status report. Also, as mentioned before, more community testers definitely helps to identify and troubleshoot these issues.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-25-22-will-you-guys-put-new-testnet-builds-out-now-that-the-download-links-have-expired\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1522\">25:22</a>) Will you guys put new testnet builds out now that the download links have expired?</h3><p><em>“What we’re trying to avoid with the 10-day expiry limit on download links is the number of available bugs out there. We don’t want people using old builds and reporting bugs and issues that have already been fixed in new releases. There’s also a second aspect to it in that we ideally want to include new stuff for the community to test everytime we do new releases to keep it interesting to the community to keep the number of testers high! There should be a new testnet build coming out soon so keep an eye on the #testing channel!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-28-07-you-mentioned-in-your-interview-with-cryptoguard-that-you-were-excited-about-future-use-cases-features-and-dapps-for-particl-do-you-have-any-idea-on-top-of-your-head-you-can-share\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1687\">28:07</a>) You mentioned in your interview with Cryptoguard that you were excited about future use-cases, features, and Dapps for Particl. Do you have any idea on top of your head you can share?</h3><p><em>“I’ve actually been discussing with Cryptoguard in private chats the other day ideas we and other people from the community and team have had over time. There’s a couple of them floating around, but currently, the main focus really is about getting the marketplace up and we need to push that hard. We’re hesitant to mention anything specific at the moment because we don’t want to switch the focus on other stuff.</em></p><p><em>What really excites me in that regard though is that there are many ideas out there that would be possible to implement. Getting ideas from the community is what we need to go forward, and is a great mental exercise to identify what we need to focus on next after the marketplace. For the moment, I won’t elaborate too much and keep that for after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-30-44-what-are-your-thoughts-on-the-potential-of-the-coming-developer-sdk-how-do-you-see-particl-as-a-decentralized-and-privacy-focused-economy-rather-than-just-a-currency\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1844\">30:44</a>) What are your thoughts on the potential of the coming developer SDK? How do you see Particl as a decentralized and privacy-focused economy rather than just a currency?</h3><p><em>“That’s extremely important to have that baseline of privacy, and then everything built on top of that is beneficial. Getting the community involved as well, in the long run, is going to really push the project forward and will probably be the driver for mass adoption. There’s already going to be the marketplace available, but taking it beyond that is really going to transform the GUI (Particl Desktop) into essentially a platform with a similar approach to a plugin-based platform architecture. Whether future Dapps and features are developed by us or by the community…I really believe this is going to be the driving force for mass adoption!”</em></p><h3 id=\"-33-30-has-particl-been-your-introduction-to-blockchain-development\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2010\">33:30</a>) Has Particl been your introduction to blockchain development?</h3><p><em>“My very very first introduction to cryptocurrencies was back in 2011–2012 when I first heard about it. I didn’t really know about it at the time and kind of pushed it to the side to see what would happen before I do anything about it. Then, one of the companies I was working with started to look into crypto and that’s when I really could evaluate what was happening in the space. That’s around the time I first bought Bitcoin as well as some other coins.

That being said, that doesn’t it won’t ever happen, but as Arnold said, it’s important to focus on one thing at a thing and not spread ourselves too thin, otherwise, lots of stuff get started but few of them actually get finished up.

We’re making good progress on them though, especially on the [object Object] issue lots of people have been having.</em></p><p><em>In most cases, the fixes are pretty simple, it’s more about figuring about how the bugs are generated and not breaking anything else while fixing them. That's pretty much what automated test cases are for, and I think we need to have more of them. It’s one of the goals we’re all currently working towards at the same time as shown in the status report. Also, as mentioned before, more community testers definitely helps to identify and troubleshoot these issues.”</em></p><h3 id=\"-25-22-will-you-guys-put-new-testnet-builds-out-now-that-the-download-links-have-expired\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1522\">25:22</a>) Will you guys put new testnet builds out now that the download links have expired?</h3><p><em>“What we’re trying to avoid with the 10-day expiry limit on download links is the number of available bugs out there. We don’t want people using old builds and reporting bugs and issues that have already been fixed in new releases. There’s also a second aspect to it in that we ideally want to include new stuff for the community to test everytime we do new releases to keep it interesting to the community to keep the number of testers high!

Getting the community involved as well, in the long run, is going to really push the project forward and will probably be the driver for mass adoption. There’s already going to be the marketplace available, but taking it beyond that is really going to transform the GUI (Particl Desktop) into essentially a platform with a similar approach to a plugin-based platform architecture.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
