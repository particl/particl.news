Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
