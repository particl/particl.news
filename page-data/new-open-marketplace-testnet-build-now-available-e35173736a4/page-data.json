This time, it is also\naccompanied by a testnet bug bounty that will reward you for finding bugs\nrelated to the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nEver since the last testnet build of the Open Marketplace on the 10th of July,\nthe Particl team has not only been very busy integrating RingCT into the escrow\nsystem of the marketplace but also fixing a market start-up and switching issue\nidentified earlier last week. It is with great excitement that it can be\nannounced today that the testnet build is now ready for public testing and will \nmove up onto mainnet on the 12th of August, 2019!\n\nGet Started!\nDownload and get started with testing the Open Marketplace by following this\nGithub link:\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha2-testnet]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

For those of you that have tested the marketplace on testnet before, please\n    do remember that you will need to wipe your existing marketplace database,\n    otherwise, you may encounter errors that will break your experience. The\n    location of your particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New Since Last Time?\nNew Features\n * Fully anonymous escrow support, powered by RingCT\n * Added the ability to support free shipping\n * Added text to the help sections on the buy and sell page to indicate to users\n   that their wallets need to be unlocked to process buy flow messages\n * Error message dialog for when proposal creation fails\n\nChanges to Existing Features\n * On the top bar of the listings, buy and sell pages, the available Anon\n   balance of your wallet is displayed\n * “Spendable” and “Locked” on the Overview page is now a summary of all\n   balances\n * Instead of the balance transfer label on the Overview page, the transaction\n   type is now displayed (i.e. Converted to blind)\n * Added the ability to copy the text in the console window\n\nFixed Issues & Bugs\n * Cold staking Zap functionality\n * Converting between public and private balances\n * When converting between balances and selecting the Make payment button, a\n   popup will be displayed to unlock your wallet if it is encrypted. You then\n   need to confirm the transaction. If you click away from the popup, it will\n   disappear and the Make payment button will remain greyed out\n * Flagging of listings with 1 UTXO now works properly. Before the fix, it would\n   show as flagged but not be removed from your Listings page\n * Validation added that the balance transfer fee is subtracted from the amount\n   requested\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarn PART by Participating in the Bug Bounty\nSince this build is the version of the marketplace that’s going to move up onto\nmainnet, it is this time accompanied by a bug bounty where you stand to earn\nPART coins for finding any bug related to the marketplace. This ensures that as\nmany testers as possible can try to break, hack into, or find vulnerabilities in\nthe Particl Open Marketplace before it launches and gets used with real funds.\n\nTo find all the details about this bug bounty, as well as the prizes, follow the\nlink below.\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Testnet Bug Bounty\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple: Download\nthe latest testnet build of the Open…\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\n\nWhat’s Next?\nSince this is the final round of testing before the Particl Open Marketplace\nmoves up onto mainnet, the following days are going to be packed as the team\nprepares the Open Marketplace for its grand mainnet launch.

This bug bounty rewards testers in PART for\ntrying to break the Open Marketplace, one last time, before it goes onto mainnet\nand gets used with real funds.

This permanent bounty is aimed at rewarding users who find bugs,\nexploits, or vulnerabilities in the Particl code to securely disclose issues and\nget promptly rewarded for their hard work.

This will effectively decide what keys are going to be used once the\nfirst mainnet build of the Particl Open Marketplace will get compiled, and will\ngive Particl Desktop 2.0 its marketplace functionality.\n\nAugust 8th, 2019\nThe Particl Open Marketplace testnet bug bounty will end. The Particl developers\nwill then continue working to fix the identified bugs, if any, for the next few\nhours/days. On the same day, the set of Market Keys selected by the community\nwill be integrated into the codebase of the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nAugust 9th, 2019 - August 12th, 2019\nDuring this period of 4 days, the Particl development team will fix any\nidentified bugs and compile internal builds running on both testnet and mainnet\nto conduct the last round of internal testing.

This is when the\nParticl Open Marketplace releases on mainnet, at 12:00:00 UTC. This is the\nmoment everybody’s been waiting for, and it’s just around the corner. Indeed, on\nthis day, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be pushed, with marketplace functionality,\nonto mainnet as a public release.\n\nThis will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services using\ncryptocurrencies in a way that preserves your digital privacy and personal data.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team Gets Shuffled\nBut wait, there’s more! Because the project is now in the middle of a phase\nswitch, the Particl team is getting reshuffled to focus more on Particl adoption\nand community building. This means a few members of the team are getting new\nroles and opportunities.\n\nParticl Gets a New Community Manager\nAugust 1st also marks the day where Particl gets a new Community Manager!\nIndeed, Guillaume Benayoun, most commonly known as Ben within the Particl\ncommunity, will join the team’s ranks as Particl’s Community Manager and\nAmbassador.\n\nBen has been a very active member ever since the very beginning of Particl and\nhas almost single-handedly built the Particl FR community. Ben is also behind \nParticl’s evening of presentations at CoinHouse\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a],\nParis, which took place on the 21st of February 2019. Click the links below to\nwatch the three presentations made on this evening.\n\n * Cold Staking & Cold Staking Pools, by Guillaume Benayoun\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crzskSfKTWk]\n * The Evolution of Global eCommerce, by Lina Seiche\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQrDPzUGYaY]\n * The Role of Intermediaries in Blockchain eCommerce, by Albin Cauderlier\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfUTKTSL2-I]\n\nAs part of his new role within the Particl team, Ben will work on growing the\nmain Particl community and make it more engaging. He will ensure there is always\na team member available to answer questions, moderate the community, and keep\nthe channels clean. Additionally, he will also help on user onboarding and the\ncreation of sub-communities to drive up the adoption of the Particl Open\nMarketplace. As with any other member of the Particl communications team, he\nwill also help in a lot of other areas touching communications.\n\nCryptoguard Gets a New Role\nCryptoguard, Particl’s former Community Manager, will now assume a more strategy\nand communications-focused role within the Particl team. He will take on some of\nPaul Schmitzer’s role in managing communications and crafting the strategies\nsurrounding it. He will still be around the community and work full-time on the\nproject, but this new position will probably mean he will have a more “in the\nbackground” role. Cryptoguard has started working on these new responsibilities\na while ago, hence why getting a new Community Manager that would be entirely\nfocused on the community was necessary.\n\nPaul Schmitzer Gets a New Role\nAs part of this reshuffling on the communications team, Paul Schmitzer will take\non a more strategic and partnership-focused role, assisting Imran in doing some\nof that. Paul’s new position will be mostly focused on contacting people, help\nto form new partnerships and relationships, and managing the communications\nstrategy on a higher level.\n\nLina Seiche Leaves the Project\nLina Seiche, former Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist for Particl,\nis unfortunately leaving the project in favor of a new job offer she’s received.\nWe would like to thank Lina for her work with Particl and wish her all the best\nwith her future endeavors!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is with great excitement that we step within this final pre-mainnet phase.\nWith a few years behind our backs, it is now time to let the world know about\nthe wonders of Particl and its Open Marketplace.\n\nSo get prepared, get your computers ready for testing, and let’s revolutionize\nthe world of eCommerce together!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update/1-kxHpRkWtmo3WsOgNQlqWUg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"toward-the-mainnet-release-of-the-particl-open-marketplace\">Toward the Mainnet Release of the Particl Open Marketplace</h3><p>The gears are turning, and ever since the Market Key Generation Contest was announced on the 26th of July, the process of bringing the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet is now well in motion!</p><p>This blog post is going to be an important one — it will give you all the information you need to know about what’s coming up as well as the remaining steps before the Open Marketplace moves onto mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-road-to-mainnet\">The Road to Mainnet</h2><p>It is finally here! <strong>The Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet on the 12th of August!</strong></p><p>Ever since the 16th of July, we have entered in the final mile of the marathon that is the mainnet launch of the Particl Open Marketplace.

On top of this, the team\nwill also be giving away one (1) free limited edition t-shirt to every\nparticipant of this contest.\n\nLet’s first understand what this contest and giveaway are all about: the\ncreation and selection of market keys to be used as the default market on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * What are Market Keys?\n * Create a Set of Market Keys\n * Submit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Contest Prizes\n * Contest Rules\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Market Keys?\nTo understand market keys, we need to refer back to the difference between user\nmarkets and the main interface of the Open Marketplace.\n\nMarket Keys are similar to PART address keys. There is a private and public key\nthat identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets\nwithin Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and\nsell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl\nOpen Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable\nby all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these\nmarkets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell\nitems on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown\nto everyone without the private key.\n\nWhen installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the\nlistings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface\nof the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate\nlistings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user\nmarkets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.\n\nThese markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into\nyour local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the\nOpen Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase,\nor moderate any listing it contains.\n\nThere isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default\ninterface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can\nbe used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only\nperceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is\na market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to\nmanually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user\nmarkets need to be manually connected to.\n\n> The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user\nmarket. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the\nmain interface. —Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/]\nAs you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nrequires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default. And\nwhile no extra step is required by the user to connect to the main interface of\nthe marketplace, this “connection” still need to be made before a new version of\nthe Open Marketplace is pushed publicly.\n\n> Note: It is not required to generate a key to use the Particl Open Marketplace.\nWhen downloading and installing Particl Desktop 2.0 or higher, it will come\npre-packaged with a market key already linked to the client.\nAnd to do just that, an entity has to generate and choose what market keys will\nbe used to host the main market of the Open Marketplace. This is where the\ncommunity comes in…\n\nHow to Generate and Submit Market Keys\nWhile the Particl team is building the Open Marketplace protocol, it doesn’t own\nor has any sort of control over the network itself. It is entirely up to the\ncommunity of users to run and govern it. That also means generating and choosing\nwhat set of market keys is going to be used to display the main interface of the\nmarketplace will be a 100% community-led process.\n\n> Note: Generating a set of market keys does not give you any special access,\npermission, or power over the market. Everyone that installs the Open\nMarketplace has equal rights and oversight over the generated market. This is\nnot a trusted setup.\nIndeed, the Particl team is inviting everyone to generate a set of market keys\nof their own and submit it on Github by creating a pull request in the\nappropriate repository. Doing so is pretty simple and straight-forward.\n\nCreate a Set of Market Keys\n * Visit this website to generate a pair of keys: \n   https://walletgenerator.net/?currency=Particl\n\n> **Even better, download the app to your local machine and follow these steps\noffline**\n * Move your cursor randomly on the screen until the website automatically gives\n   you both a public address and a private key\n * Copy both keys\n\nSubmit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Open another tab, and go to the particl-market repository on Github: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-market/\n * Log into your Github account or create a new one\n * Fork the particl-market repository by clicking the Fork button at the top\n   right corner of the page\n * Wait for the repository to fork on your account\n * Once the screen automatically updates, you should now see that you are now on \n   https://github.com/your_username/particl-market\n   [https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market] instead of \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-market\n   [https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market]\n * Scroll down a little and click on the .env.dist file\n * Edit the file by clicking on the pen icon (Edit this file) at the top right\n   corner of the text editor\n * Scroll down to line 26 and 27\n * Replace the variable on line 26 with the private key you’ve just generated:\n   DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_PRIVATE_KEY=2Zc2pc9jSx2qF5tpu25DCZEr1Dwj8JBoVL5WP4H1drJsX9sP4ek\n * Delete the # at the beginning of the line\n * Replace the variable on line 27 with the public address you’ve generated:\n   DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=pmktyVZshdMAQ6DPbbRXEFNGuzMbTMkqAA\n * Delete the # at the beginning of the line\n * Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and put Default Market Key Submission\n   as the title of the commit. There should already be a greyed out title that\n   says Update .env.dist, just overwrite it.\n * Click the green Commit changes button to save the file\n * Go back to the main particl-market folder by clicking on particl-market at\n   the top of your screen\n * Create your pull request by clicking on the small Pull request button located\n   just under the Clone or download green button on the top right corner of the\n   page\n * On the next page that shows up, make sure there is a green text that says\n   Able to merge.\n * Click on the green Create pull request button to create your pull request\n * Before officially submitting your market keys, you can add any comment or\n   message you want for the community to see in the next page that comes up.\n   This message can help the community make its choice on which market keys it\n   wants to pick\n * Click on Create pull request to officially submit your pull request, thus\n   successfully submitting your keys to be picked by the community as the\n   default market keys of the Particl Open Marketplace ?\n\nContest Prizes\n * 1 Trezor hardware device given away to 3 random people who submit market keys\n * 1 free limited edition t-shirt to every person who submits market keys\n\nContest Rules\n * Market keys submissions will be accepted until the 5th of August, 14:00:00\n   UTC\n * Community voting starts on the 5th of August and will last until the 7th of\n   August.\n * Only 1 submission per participant is allowed\n * Pull requests that are not properly submitted or contain other code\n   modifications will be ignored\n * Both line 26 and 27 need to be uncommented, meaning the line cannot start\n   with #\n\n> Correct formatting: DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=YOURKEYIncorrect formatting:\n#DEFAULT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=YOURKEY\n\nHow to Vote\nThe community voting process will be held from the 5th of August to the 7th of\nAugust. To let as many people vote as possible, both Particl’s Twitter page and\nthe Particl forum will be used to collect votes. This is to ensure as many\npeople as possible can give their input on which key should be picked. More\ndetails will be announced later on.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow’s the time for you to be part of Particl’s history!

There is a private and public key that identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets within Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and sell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl Open Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable by all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these markets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell items on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown to everyone without the private key.</p><p>When installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the listings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface of the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate listings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user markets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.</p><p>These markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into your local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the Open Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase, or moderate any listing it contains.</p><p>There isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default interface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can be used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only perceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is a market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to manually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user markets need to be manually connected to.</p><blockquote>The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user market. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the main interface. — <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/\">Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer</a></blockquote><p>As you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace requires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default. And while no extra step is required by the user to connect to the main interface of the marketplace, this “connection” still need to be made before a new version of the Open Marketplace is pushed publicly.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> It is not required to generate a key to use the Particl Open Marketplace.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity.
