Its network enables decentralized applications (dapps) and smart\ncontracts in a manner similar to Ethereum, Avalanche, and Solana. Particl,\nhowever, presents major differences from those other protocols.\n\nMost “dapp networks” make exclusive use of ‘smart contracts’ — automated\nprograms that run on blockchains and execute actions based on certain\nconditions. And while smart contracts deployed on blockchains are certainly\nrevolutionary, they can carry certain security risks and technical limitations —\nnotably in terms of scaling and data storage.\n\nTypically, in order to support smart contracts, a blockchain has to be built (or\nforked) from the ground up, with smart contract functionalities already in mind\nfrom the beginning. That’s because smart contract compatible blockchains usually\nrequire a VM integration for the smart contract code to execute.\n\nWhile smart contracts are often touted as the end-all-be-all of what makes dapps\npossible, there are a few other ways to build and deploy decentralized\napplications. Such is the case with Particl and its use of the SecureMessaging\n(SMSG) protocol.\n\nThe Issue with “Privacy-Focused dapps” Within the Web3 Community\nWhile a number of other dapp networks claim to offer “smart contracts with\nprivacy”, they usually focus on one or another aspect of what makes a dapp\nprivate. Unfortunately, they fail to check all the boxes that would truly set\nthem aside traditional web applications. They either:\n\n * Use traceable payments or traceable forms of currency;\n * Leak contract contents publicly to anybody, at any time;\n * Leak the IP addresses of their users, compromising the identity and privacy\n   of users;\n * Rely on third-party servers/nodes/hosts controlled by large corporations with\n   questionable ethics or intentions;\n * Are not entirely non-custodial, making it possible for coins to be lost,\n   stolen, or even seized by central authorities\n\nFor a dapp to be considered truly private, or truly decentralized, it should\nideally check all of these boxes. Else, they are just glorified “web2”\napplications trying to exploit users by capitalizing on the web3 hype, but\nwithout providing its promised benefits. And we know that is often the case, as\nwe’ve explored before [https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/],\nmaking it potentially very damaging to a user that expects to be acting in total\nprivacy or in full control of their assets when they are, in fact, not\n[https://bitcoinist.com/iranian-venezuelan-opensea-users/].\n\nTruly Decentralized Apps Done Different\nParticl does dapps too, as is quite obvious with the one-of-a-kind Particl\nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace], but it does so in a way that's\ncompletely different than the rest of the dapp networks. \n\nIts blockchain is built using the latest Bitcoin code, which, unlike its\nEthereum counterpart, does not support “turing-complete smart contracts”. It\ndoes, however, absolutely support smart contracts — just a more rigid and tight\nversion of them. Although already powerful enough to create wonderful\napplications without intermediary, Bitcoin smart contracts are also expected to\nexpand in utility with the integration of Taproot and the upcoming Taproot-based\nTARO protocol. Subsequently, PART will adopt these features.\n\nThe purpose of Particl’s blockchain within its ecosystem is many:\n\n * Allow users to send, receive, and hold an untraceable currency in a wallet or\n   through its dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace or the BasicSwap DEX);\n * Create and interact with smart contracts;\n * Allow for a community governance of its dapps and of the network as a whole\n\nNotably, the privacy-focused Particl blockchain does not take the role of\nhosting and running the ecosystem’s dapps, and does not manage any data\non-chain. That’s because that role is, most often than not, not managed by smart\ncontracts, but instead by a completely separate layer: the SecureMessaging\n(SMSG) P2P network.\n\nSecureMessaging (SMSG) — A Game Changer for Dapps\nThe SecureMessaging (SMSG) network is Particl’s secret sauce and what sets it\naside from any other “dapp networks”. It is its own custom-built and unique P2P\nmessaging network that stands at the very core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the \nBitMessage protocol [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network\nis a decentralized\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Decentralization] \nstorage network (DSN) that stores and transfers data across nodes in a\nprivacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).\n\nWhat SMSG does is enable a private and secure data transfer layer for dApps to\nleverage. Contrary to smart-contracts, which often run through centralized\nthird-party nodes, every user of Particl dapp is a SMSG node, ensuring an\noptimal level of decentralization but also making active and passive network\nanalysis much more complicated. \n\nAs a result, you create complex applications without middlemen and data mining\nwithout relying on over-complicated smart-contracts that may leave glaring holes\nopen for attackers to exploit. \n\nSMSG powers Particl dapps, like the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] and the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, but without\nbloating the blockchain with excessive data and without leaving any permanent\nrecord.\n\nSMSG's Network TopologySMSG occupies several important functions within the\ncurrent Particl ecosystem:\n\nData storage and transfer: The network can store almost any type of data and\ntransfer it from one user to another, or to the entirety of the network, in a\ncompletely end-to-end encrypted and decentralized manner. The identities of the\nsender and receiver(s) of that data remain anonymous at any point in time to\nunauthorized parties and there’s no server involved at any point of the process.\n\nSecure communications: Text, too, is data. The SMSG network allows for two or\nmore parties to communicate with one another through an instant messaging\nprotocol, without relying on any centralized servers. All messages are\nend-to-end encrypted and can never be decrypted by an unauthorized party.\n\nExecute smart escrow instructions: A critical part of the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] dapp is its unique two-party escrow system\nwhich relies on a simplified Bitcoin-style smart contract. Instead of coding\nseveral functions and conditions into the smart contract itself, which carries\nits load of risks and potential vulnerabilities, the Particl smart contract\ninstead listens to instructions received from the SMSG network based on the\naction of participating users. This simplifies the smart-contract process, which\nin turn limits vulnerabilities, and offsets the complex interaction with the\nescrow to the SMSG network. When it comes to smart contracts, simplicity is\nsecurity.\n\nHost marketplace listing content: Because hosting listing data (i.e., product\ndescriptions and images) directly on-chain can quickly bloat a blockchain and\nmake it incredibly large, the Particl Marketplace dapp relies on SMSG’s private\ndata storage functionality to store and provide that information.\n\nEnable complex DEX with orderbooks: With the help of SMSG and ‘scriptless\nscripts’, a type of off-chain smart contract, cross-chain DEXs can now exist\nwith complete order book functionalities that don't require central parties to\nstore and process its data. While the atomic swap technology lets two users swap\ncryptocurrencies with no intermediary, a secondary messaging layer is necessary\nto carry data between the two chains without the use of wrapped assets or third\nparties — which is precisely where most of the challenges related to cross-chain\nDEXs lie.  SMSG takes the role of safely and privately aggregating the\ninformation (order details, order prices, user actions, etc.) and communicating\nbetween users of two different blockchains, like Particl, Bitcoin, and even\nMonero.\n\nAs we can see, a lot can be accomplished with Particl’s basic smart contracts\nusing the SMSG network. It is what puts the Particl ecosystem in a league of its\nown and the reason why Particl’s dapps possess a level of privacy and\ndecentralization that is unmatched — there isn't any compromise and they truly\ncheck all the boxes mentioned in the section above!\n\nImproving SMSG Beyond its Current Capabilities\nAs we’ve seen, SMSG is a great P2P network that enables private data storage and\nprocessing, secure and encrypted communications, and even anonymous dapps. But\nit’s also faced with a significant challenge — that of scalability.\n\nIndeed, for all its glory, the SMSG network is limited in terms of scalability\nand could bottleneck when Particl reaches a large enough level of adoption.\nWhile it can support a lot of data and many thousand of messages per day, it\ncould hit its throughput limit should too many people use it at the same time,\nor if it’s made to support a particularly heavy data load.\n\nSMSG 2.0 — More Scalability and More Functionality\nThis is the reason why the Particl team plans, as part of its roadmap\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021#major-milestones], a major overhaul of\nits code, which includes the exciting release of SMSG 2.0. This SMSG update will\nmake Particl’s unique open source P2P network scalable enough to support any\nlevel of adoption — a must when building dApps that seek to challenge the status\nquo!\n\nAdditionally, it will not only support data storage and transfer anymore, but\nalso support the hosting and browsing of content on it, similarly to how the Tor\nnetwork functions. Imagine browsing web pages and using dapps straight from the\nSMSG network and without connecting to the \"clearnet\". That's where we're headed\nat!\n\nWe’ll be covering all the juicy details about SMSG 2.0 and much more information\nabout how it will power the Particl ecosystem moving forward in an upcoming\nParticl News blog post shortly, so, as always, keep your eyes peeled for future\nupdates coming to Particl News!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is a decentralized ecosystem of privacy-focused applications.

It is its own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network that stands at the very core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\">BitMessage protocol</a>, the SMSG network is a<a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Decentralization\"> decentralized</a> storage network (DSN) that stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>What SMSG does is enable a private and secure data transfer layer for dApps to leverage. Contrary to smart-contracts, which often run through centralized third-party nodes, every user of Particl dapp is a SMSG node, ensuring an optimal level of decentralization but also making active and passive network analysis much more complicated. </p><p>As a result, you create complex applications without middlemen and data mining without relying on over-complicated smart-contracts that may leave glaring holes open for attackers to exploit. </p><p>SMSG powers Particl dapps, like the <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> and the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, but without bloating the blockchain with excessive data and without leaving any permanent record.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2022/06/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>SMSG's Network Topology</em></figcaption></figure><p>SMSG occupies several important functions within the current Particl ecosystem:</p><p><strong>Data storage and transfer: </strong>The network can store almost any type of data and transfer it from one user to another, or to the entirety of the network, in a completely end-to-end encrypted and decentralized manner. The identities of the sender and receiver(s) of that data remain anonymous at any point in time to unauthorized parties and there’s no server involved at any point of the process.</p><p><strong>Secure communications:</strong> Text, too, is data. The SMSG network allows for two or more parties to communicate with one another through an instant messaging protocol, without relying on any centralized servers. All messages are end-to-end encrypted and can never be decrypted by an unauthorized party.</p><p><strong>Execute smart escrow instructions: </strong>A critical part of the <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> dapp is its unique two-party escrow system which relies on a simplified Bitcoin-style smart contract. Instead of coding several functions and conditions into the smart contract itself, which carries its load of risks and potential vulnerabilities, the Particl smart contract instead listens to instructions received from the SMSG network based on the action of participating users. This simplifies the smart-contract process, which in turn limits vulnerabilities, and offsets the complex interaction with the escrow to the SMSG network. When it comes to smart contracts, simplicity is security.</p><p><strong>Host marketplace listing content:</strong> Because hosting listing data (i.e., product descriptions and images) directly on-chain can quickly bloat a blockchain and make it incredibly large, the Particl Marketplace dapp relies on SMSG’s private data storage functionality to store and provide that information.</p><p><strong>Enable complex DEX with orderbooks:</strong> With the help of SMSG and ‘scriptless scripts’, a type of off-chain smart contract, cross-chain DEXs can now exist with complete order book functionalities that don't require central parties to store and process its data. While the atomic swap technology lets two users swap cryptocurrencies with no intermediary, a secondary messaging layer is necessary to carry data between the two chains without the use of wrapped assets or third parties — which is precisely where most of the challenges related to cross-chain DEXs lie.  SMSG takes the role of safely and privately aggregating the information (order details, order prices, user actions, etc.) and communicating between users of two different blockchains, like Particl, Bitcoin, and even Monero.</p><p>As we can see, a lot can be accomplished with Particl’s basic smart contracts using the SMSG network. It is what puts the Particl ecosystem in a league of its own and the reason why Particl’s dapps possess a level of privacy and decentralization that is unmatched — there isn't any compromise and they truly check all the boxes mentioned in the section above!</p><h2 id=\"improving-smsg-beyond-its-current-capabilities\">Improving SMSG Beyond its Current Capabilities</h2><p>As we’ve seen, SMSG is a great P2P network that enables private data storage and processing, secure and encrypted communications, and even anonymous dapps. But it’s also faced with a significant challenge — that of scalability.</p><p>Indeed, for all its glory, the SMSG network is limited in terms of scalability and could bottleneck when Particl reaches a large enough level of adoption. While it can support a lot of data and many thousand of messages per day, it could hit its throughput limit should too many people use it at the same time, or if it’s made to support a particularly heavy data load.</p><h3 id=\"smsg-2-0-more-scalability-and-more-functionality\">SMSG 2.0 — More Scalability and More Functionality</h3><p>This is the reason why the Particl team plans, <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021#major-milestones\">as part of its roadmap</a>, a major overhaul of its code, which includes the exciting release of SMSG 2.0. This SMSG update will make Particl’s unique open source P2P network scalable enough to support any level of adoption — a must when building dApps that seek to challenge the status quo!</p><p>Additionally, it will not only support data storage and transfer anymore, but also support the hosting and browsing of content on it, similarly to how the Tor network functions. Imagine browsing web pages and using dapps straight from the SMSG network and without connecting to the \"clearnet\". That's where we're headed at!</p><p>We’ll be covering all the juicy details about SMSG 2.0 and much more information about how it will power the Particl ecosystem moving forward in an upcoming Particl News blog post shortly, so, as always, keep your eyes peeled for future updates coming to Particl News!</p><hr><p><em>Particl is a decentralized ecosystem of privacy-focused applications.

3.2\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-live-on-mainnet/] and its messaging\nsystem behind us, it’s time to look into what exactly Particl Desktop 3.3 will\nbring forth to the table.\n\nFirst off, we’d like to mention that, following the release of Particl Desktop\n3.3, Particl will begin with its next major evolutionary phase by introducing a\nnew layer of distributed services. The concept we've built with Particl\nMarketplace undoubtedly works, and now it's time to unfold beyond our current\nscope and expand towards the wider Web3 environment. As we've highlighted\nrecently [https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], Web3 is the\npromise of an open, decentralized, non-custodial, immutable, and private web\nenvironment that is as easy to use as any other web service, but it's currently\nplagued by many issues which we fully intend on tackling with Particl's next\nevolutionary phase. More information about what Particl's next evolutionary\nphase entails will be communicated very shortly here on Particl News.\n\nWeb3 Exposed! Is it Only a Mirage?A cold hard and in-depth look into the\npromises and current realities of “Web3”.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]But for now, let's take\na look at what Particl Desktop 3.3 will bring to the table. This release focuses\non improving various back-end processes and improving the client’s user\nconfigurability to get Particl Desktop ready for the upcoming new major\ndevelopment cycle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 Items\nBefore getting into the list of deliverables for Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like\nto mention that this list is tentative, meaning that not necessarily all of the\nitems listed here will end up in the next update. In a way, this is more akin to\na wishlist than a definitive checklist, but this should give you a good idea of\nwhat we’re aiming for with this next update.\n\nNevertheless, let’s take a look at the items we’re currently looking into for\nParticl Desktop 3.3.\n\nUpdate Particl desktop Dependencies\nMostly a back-end maintenance task, updating the client’s dependencies keeps it\nup-to-date and ensures security issues don't creep in. Additionally, it makes\nsure no compatibility issues appear, such as we’ve seen recently with the\nFedora/Manjaro OS environments.\n\nParticl Desktop Startup Changes\nThis significant modification changes how the startup process runs by putting\nmore control into the user’s hands. Some of the changes for this include\nremoving the automatic download and/or start of particld on the start of Particl\nDesktop and adding various options like  download/start/stop/restart/auto-start\nto the user interface. Also included in this change is the ability to block the\nstart of different desktop apps unless Particl Core is currently running. This\nshould eliminate a few edge case issues and give users more control over their\nexperience, notably with the ability to improve their client performance based\non their specific utilization of it.\n\nAdd a Basic Settings and Configuration Implementation\nSimilar to the item mentioned above, a basic settings and configuration\nimplementation will enable users to tweak various settings right from the GUI.\nThis is a one-up over the currently available settings in Particl Desktop, this\nimplementation will let users tweak more settings and do so more granularly.\nThis implementation will touch on things such as indicating how to start/stop\nparticl-core (auto-start or manual start, for example), as well as various\nsettings related to download location, etc.\n\nUpdate Particl Desktop to Use Particl Core v22\nThis item is self-explanatory. Particl Desktop 3.3 will work over the more\nrecent Particl Core V22. You can consult the list of changes introduced by\nParticl Core V22 here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md]\n.\n\nParticl Market — Allow for the Deletion of Previously Published Templates\nThis widely requested feature from some of our current sellers on the\nmarketplace relates to the deletion of listing templates once they have been\npublished on a market or storefront at least once. This is a relatively\nsignificant change but will go a long way in improving sellers' user experience.\n\nParticl Market — Remove the Requirement for Markets to Belong to a Single\nIdentity\nExpanding on the concept of multiple identities, we're removing the restriction\nthat a market can only be joined by a single identity at a time. This will add\nthe ability for markets or storefronts to be accessed by different identities.\nOne notable benefit of this feature is the added privacy aspect of decoupling\nmarket ownership, vendor account ownership, and chat message identities.\n\nParticl Market — Remove the Reviews & Comments Section\nThis section, which doesn't seem to be used much, is now made redundant thanks\nto the introduction of the better chat functionality of Particl Desktop 3.2 now.\nFor this reason, we will remove its implementation from the system.\n\nParticl Desktop — Allow for Alternative PD Utilized URLs to be Supported\nThis should allow for supporting Tor-related links to various services.\n\nParticl Desktop currently makes use of various internet-related services, as\nwell as providing various web links that the user may click on for various\nreasons. For example, when checking for, and the downloading of, a new\nparticl-core version, Particl Desktop makes a connection to Github. Another\nexample is the links in the Help & Support section of Particl Desktop that\nprovide links to the social media sites of the Particl project (that open on the\nuser's browser when clicked on).\n\nThese links are all currently fixed and hard-coded. This can present a problem\n(particularly for the initial particl-core download on the first run of the\napplication), for those wishing to use Particl Desktop over Tor (or similarly\nrestricted environments) where access to public services/URLs such as Github\nmight be restricted or unwanted.\n\nThe solution aimed here is to remove these hard-coded URLs, allow them to be\nconfigurable as well (via the aforementioned PD Settings feature), and offer\nTor-related alternatives, if available, for those wanting them.\n\nParticl Market — Add the Ability to Purchase Digital Items\nThe ability to purchase digital items, or rather, items that do not require\nphysical addresses for shipping, is something we started looking into a while\nago. However, due to the significant changes it required, we put that\ndeliverable on ice for a little while. For Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like to\njump back into it and work towards making that a possibility.\n\nMinor UI Tweaks and Improvements, and Bug Fixes\nThere is a list of minor UI and UX tweaks we want to include in the desktop\nclient. This includes, but isn’t limited to, ordering of the listed markets,\nshowing a list of messages sent by a saved chat participant, and more.\nAdditionally, as always, there’s also a list of minor issues and bugs we want to\nfix for Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nStay Tuned for More Details on Particl’s Next Evolutionary Process\nAs mentioned above, we are planning on beginning with Particl's next\nevolutionary process right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. This\nprocess will not only introduce a new layer of distributed services to the\necosystem and bring Particl up to par with the expected level of accessibility\nfrom Web3 apps, but it will also improve said Web3 in many ways by tackling some\nof its most urgent issues, as we've highlighted in this Particl Story\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]. \n\nIn fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to\nmake the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers,\nvendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable\nwith established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work,\nand more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3\necosystem and community.\n\nIn other words, it is a major stride at increasing Particl’s aim for becoming\nthe go-to solution and hub for non-interference and privacy-first applications\nwithin the new but fast-growing Web3 community. Because, we believe people shall\nnot be the product and that corporate monopolies don’t help create a better\nworld.\n\nThere will be much more to talk about in detail and you’ll read it here first,\non Particl News in the coming weeks.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

For example, when checking for, and the downloading of, a new particl-core version, Particl Desktop makes a connection to Github. Another example is the links in the Help &#x26; Support section of Particl Desktop that provide links to the social media sites of the Particl project (that open on the user's browser when clicked on).</p><p>These links are all currently fixed and hard-coded. This can present a problem (particularly for the initial particl-core download on the first run of the application), for those wishing to use Particl Desktop over Tor (or similarly restricted environments) where access to public services/URLs such as Github might be restricted or unwanted.</p><p>The solution aimed here is to remove these hard-coded URLs, allow them to be configurable as well (via the aforementioned PD Settings feature), and offer Tor-related alternatives, if available, for those wanting them.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-add-the-ability-to-purchase-digital-items\"><strong>Particl Market — Add the Ability to Purchase Digital Items</strong></h3><p>The ability to purchase digital items, or rather, items that do not require physical addresses for shipping, is something we started looking into a while ago.

This process will not only introduce a new layer of distributed services to the ecosystem and bring Particl up to par with the expected level of accessibility from Web3 apps, but it will also improve said Web3 in many ways by tackling some of its most urgent issues, as we've highlighted in this <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">Particl Story</a>. </p><p>In fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to make the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers, vendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable with established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work, and more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3 ecosystem and community.</p><p>In other words, it is a major stride at increasing Particl’s aim for becoming the go-to solution and hub for non-interference and privacy-first applications within the new but fast-growing Web3 community.

This is due to an issue with Electron and will be fixed with\n   the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. \n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes, it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * The previous default market, the Open Market, is no longer joined by default\n   on a fresh/clean installation.\n * Navigating to the \"listings browser\" section, when no markets are joined,\n   will now indicate that a market needs to be joined (and present navigation\n   options to the \"market browser\").\n * If the Open Market market is not currently joined, the option to join this\n   market is displayed semi-permanently above the list of promoted markets\n   (making it available as an option for new users when no markets are actively\n   being promoted).\n * For users updating from earlier versions in which the Open Market was joined\n   by default, the ability to remove/un-join the Open Market is now available\n   (i.e., the market can be removed/un-joined just like any other market now).\n * An additional filter has been added to the Batch Publish Modal to allow for\n   the filtering of items that have previously been published to a selected\n   market.\n * Product codes, or unique seller codes for items, can now be specified for\n   different items. A product code can only be added to a product template but\n   it is visible on the market specific templates that are derived from the same\n   product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a\n   market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify\n   specific items.\n * The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page),\n   is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should\n   now be more easily identified.\n * Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing\n   messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any\n   chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages\n   are only visible between the buyer and seller.\n\nWallet\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI and functionality of the\nwallet module, for convenience:\n\n * An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration\n   input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at\n   the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or to\n   the beginning of the value only).\n * It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmations.\n * A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\"\n   to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. \n * Wallets are now grouped according to location/function. This all should make\n   wallet selection slightly easier particularly when a number of wallets have\n   been created.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.2 and the long-anticipated messaging system now out on\nmainnet, stay tuned for a follow-up blog post that will detail what's to come\nnext with Particl Desktop 3.3. and beyond ?\n\nWe hope you enjoy this new Particl Desktop release and thank you for your\npassion and dedication to the Particl mission.

publicly available on\ntestnet! You can now download and install the new desktop client and thoroughly\ntest all the new additions and improvements.\n\nUser Messaging (Marketplace) ?\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new Particl Desktop client update introduces a new and major\nmarketplace feature: user messaging. It lets sellers and buyers (as well as\npotential buyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form.\n\nUser messaging is available in two different ways. On one end, each listing now\nhas a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to the seller. All\nmessages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable, meaning anyone\ncan see current and past messages sent this way. This function is likely to\nreplace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get your feedback\nand thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet round.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\n> Note: At this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet.

[http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]\nAnd many more... ?\nThere are a lot of other UI and user experience improvements coming along with\nParticl Desktop 3.2. For a full list of these changes, refer to the change log \nhere [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001] or\nat the bottom of this blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2.0-RC-001: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.2.0 Public Testnet (release 1) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopTestnet release version for the upcoming v3.2.0RELEASE\nINFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET\nVERSION 3.2.0 (RC 001)testnet0.21.2.90.3.91.7.0 ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001]To get\ntestnet coins, visit the Particl faucet [https://faucet.particl.xyz/].\n\nIf you happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nPARTICL ACADEMY\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode\n   \"165.22.203.185:51938\" \"add\".\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * The Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\n   application can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * The previous default market, the Open Market, is no longer joined by default\n   on a fresh/clean installation.\n * Navigating to the \"listings browser\" section, when no markets are joined,\n   will now indicate that a market needs to be joined (and present navigation\n   options to the \"market browser\").\n * If the Open Market market is not currently joined, the option to join this\n   market is displayed semi-permanently above the list of promoted markets\n   (making it available as an option for new users when no market is actively\n   being promoted).\n * For users updating from earlier versions in which the Open Market was joined\n   by default, the ability to remove/un-join the Open Market is now available\n   (i.e., the Open Market can be removed/un-joined just like any other market).\n * An additional filter has been added to the Batch Publish Modal to allow for\n   the filtering of items that have previously been published to a selected\n   market.\n * Product codes, or unique seller codes for items, can now be specified for\n   different items. A product code can only be added to a product template but\n   it is visible on the market-specific templates that are derived from the same\n   product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a\n   market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify\n   specific items.\n * The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page),\n   is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should\n   now be more easily identified.\n * Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing\n   messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any\n   chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages\n   are only visible between the buyer and seller.\n\nWallet\n * An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration\n   input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at\n   the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or the\n   beginning of the value only).\n * It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmation.\n * A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\"\n   to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. Wallets are now also grouped according to\n   location/function. This all should make wallet selection slightly easier\n   particularly when several wallets have been created.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n * Please only use the .dmg file to install the application for Mac OSX 10.15 or\n   greater. The .app file extracted from the zip package does not currently run\n   on OSX 10.15 (although it should work correctly on 10.14 (Mojave) or\n   earlier).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned above, we would love to get your input on the deprecation of the\n\"Reviews\" functionality in favor of the new Chat system. Feel free to test it\nout, ask questions, and leave your remarks on our chatrooms, your thoughts are\ngreatly appreciated and help us shape a better product for the benefit of all!\n\nOnce a few days of testnet have passed and barring any major issue, Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release on mainnet. We will soon communicate what\nare the plans for moving towards Particl Desktop 3.3 and beyond, so make sure to\nstay tuned!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It promised us, the people, a level of financial and\neconomic freedom truly never seen before.\n\nBut is Bitcoin really enough, and can it survive the onslaught of government\nregulations and control coming its way? The answer is nuanced and more complex\nthan most like to admit.\n\nThe Worrying Reality of Financial Spying\nAs we've seen in previous Particl stories (1\n[https://particl.news/the-internet-is-centralized-that-spells-trouble-for-all-of-us/]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/], 3\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/]), the web is\nundergoing a worrying trend of centralization and data consumption abuse. Every\nday, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so\nthat they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - generally\nwithout\nyour informed consent\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]. That\ndata is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations\nto governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to\nuse it against you or for their own motives.\n\nIt is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial\nlife. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many\ngovernments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about\nyou. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide,\nit still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very\nrecent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable\nfinancial data.\n\nBe Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick\nYou've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year;\nstarted in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently\ninspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a\nbig political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum\nframing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an\nirresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.\n\nAnd as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet\nlit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.\n\nMobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and\nthose funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all\naround the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to block\nthe\nfundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/] \n(which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In\nresponse, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more\nopen donation service: GiveSendGo.\n\nGiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that\nwould support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t\nto be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited\nand hacked, which led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors\n[https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/]. Their\nnames, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The\nhorror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential\nimpact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the\ntrucker convoy.\n\nNo matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the\nissue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or\nnot. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can\nbe weaponized. \n\nThis tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it\ncomes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital\nand trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there\nis a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to\nprotect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.\n\nAnd then came Bitcoin\nBitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a\nrevolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or\nblocked.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past\nfew weeks – from Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto\naccounts\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/]\n, to the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from\ntheir assets on the basis on their Russian nationality\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8]\n. This all boils down to cryptocurrency users too often depending on centralized\nentities.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still providing all the freedom they set out to\nprovide; but if you use third-party services, you in effect forfeit true\nownership of your coins and go back to the old patterns of not owning your\nmoney. Pro-tip: Always use non-custodial wallets and be very careful which\nservice you send your coins to!\n\nA question however remains: how did these companies know the identity and\nnationality of the owners of certain crypto addresses in the first place?\n\nBitcoin: Often Anything but Anonymous\nIn a day and age where financial data is worth gold, Bitcoin suffers from a\nterrible Achille's heel: all transactions are transparent and publicly displayed\non an open ledger, and all the financial data of its holders in effect become\navailable information. And that's becoming increasingly worrying as blockchain\ntracing firms and crypto service providers are now in possession of very\ninvasive and effective technology to trace Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo illustrate the sad reality of today's Bitcoin, see it this way. How would you\nfeel walking down the street, with a picture of your bank account and credit\ncard(s) balances stamped on your forehead? Anyone that walks past you and that\nis curious enough to look up would see exactly how much you own and in which\naccount. They would also be able to see exactly with who you’ve transacted since\nyou opened your accounts. They could see exactly what you bought, what you\ninvested in, how much you donated to whom, a full and precise picture of your\nrevenue and savings, and so on. Clearly, no one in their right mind would do\nthis.\n\nIn many cases, this is precisely what Bitcoin does to your financial information\nnow. With all the tracing tech around, combined with the need to KYC yourself to\nuse almost any exchange or service provider, anyone curious enough can simply\nquery the publicly available information, draft a provably accurate and very\nprecise picture of your finances, and know exactly who's financial profile that\nis.\n\nThe array of people that can now know this information extends from governments\nand banks, to almost any corporation or private individual. A notable \"step\ndown\" from the traditional financial system when it comes to financial privacy.\n\nA Good Crypto is a Private Crypto\nAs great as Bitcoin sounds, it is having a hard time realizing its initial\nvision - even after 14 years of existence - precisely because of those privacy\nissues. Luckily, it's not the only digital currency around.\n\nWe've seen a few cryptocurrencies focus solely on this issue of privacy, making\nthem very good candidates to be considered as true alternatives to cash and as\ngreat settlement layers for the web of today and tomorrow.\n\nAmongst them there is Monero, which uses the very solid RingCT privacy protocol,\nor Firo with its more exotic privacy setup. We also have Zcash, a very\nwell-known privacy coin - and many others. Each of them presents a different\ntwist to the angle of privacy and comes with different codebases, strengths, and\nlimitations.\n\nBut privacy generally comes with concessions in flexibility. While the examples\nmentioned above are great alternatives to Bitcoin because of the privacy they\nprovide, their use-case is pretty much limited to person-to-person currency\ntransactions. And although they accomplish their purpose well, a lot of\npotentials is left unexploited, especially as we've seen, in recent years, the\nadvent of \"dapps\" (distributed applications) and of Web3, a new \"take\" on the\nweb that promises data ownership and to do away with centralized parties.\n\nBecause of the limitations of privacy coins, they, unfortunately, cannot be used\nin any Dapp or be an important part of Web3. And in reality, all the promises of\nWeb3 are more or less moot if its settlement layer is not private. They will\nfall prey to the same issues mentioned earlier in this article - whether it is\nWeb2 or Web3.\n\nA Modern Privacy Coin Fills That Gap\nThat is what motivated us to build PART [https://particl.io/coin]. It is a\nmodern privacy coin that uses the most battle-tested codebase, Bitcoin, and the\nmost battle-tested privacy protocol, RingCT (the same privacy protocol used by\nMonero). But unlike other privacy coins, PART [https://particl.io/coin] is built\nwith flexibility in mind, so that it can be used in Dapps and on Web3. Case in\npoint: PART is currently the default settlement layer of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], a decentralized and private eBay-like\nmarketplace, where one can buy and sell anything without fees, middlemen, or\nrestrictions.\n\nBy leveraging the flexible Bitcoin codebase and adding to it solid privacy\ntechnologies, PART succeeds in fixing Bitcoin's biggest problem of financial\nspying, all the while being available for use as settlement for this new wave of\nWeb3 applications. It’s basically getting the cake and eating it too.\n\nAnd to add more merit to it, we've designed it in a way to be fully compatible\nwith the Lightning Network - meaning any scalability or high fee concern that\none might have with privacy coins is completely a thing of the past. PART is\nindeed completely private, almost infinitely scalable, and near-free to\ntransact.\n\nWith PART [https://particl.io/coin], we intend to give you full absolute control\nover your money in a way that's safe and future-proof. We are excited to move\nforward and keep on innovating within the Web3 space with tech that keeps you\nand your information safe from prying eyes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf that sounds great to you, then we encourage you to learn more about PART\n[https://particl.io/coin]'s cryptocurrency and the suite of Web3 applications\nwe're building (marketplace, DEX, messaging app, etc) here [https://particl.io/]\n, and join our awesome and motivated global community on Telegram\n[https://t.me/particlOn], Element\n[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org] or Discord\n[https://discord.me/particl]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

The answer is nuanced and more complex than most like to admit.</p><h2 id=\"the-worrying-reality-of-financial-spying\">The Worrying Reality of Financial Spying</h2><p>As we've seen in previous Particl stories (<a href=\"https://particl.news/the-internet-is-centralized-that-spells-trouble-for-all-of-us/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">3</a>), the web is undergoing a worrying trend of centralization and data consumption abuse. Every day, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so that they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - <a href=\"https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/\">generally without your informed consent</a>. That data is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations to governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to use it against you or for their own motives.</p><p>It is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial life. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many governments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about you. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide, it still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very recent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable financial data.</p><h2 id=\"be-careful-how-you-partake-in-politics-or-you-ll-get-the-stick\">Be Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick</h2><p>You've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year; started in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently inspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a big political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum framing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an irresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.</p><p>And as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet lit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.</p><p>Mobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and those funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all around the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/\">block the fundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing</a> (which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In response, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more open donation service: GiveSendGo.</p><p>GiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that would support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t to be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited and hacked, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/\">led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors</a>. Their names, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The horror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential impact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the trucker convoy.</p><p>No matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the issue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or not. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can be weaponized. </p><p>This tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it comes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital and trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there is a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to protect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.</p><h2 id=\"and-then-came-bitcoin\">And then came Bitcoin</h2><p>Bitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a revolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or blocked.</p><p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past few weeks – from <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/\">Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto accounts</a>, to <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from their assets on the basis on their Russian nationality</a>.

And that's becoming increasingly worrying as blockchain tracing firms and crypto service providers are now in possession of very invasive and effective technology to trace Bitcoin payments.</p><p>To illustrate the sad reality of today's Bitcoin, see it this way. How would you feel walking down the street, with a picture of your bank account and credit card(s) balances stamped on your forehead? Anyone that walks past you and that is curious enough to look up would see exactly how much you own and in which account. They would also be able to see exactly with who you’ve transacted since you opened your accounts. They could see exactly what you bought, what you invested in, how much you donated to whom, a full and precise picture of your revenue and savings, and so on. Clearly, no one in their right mind would do this.</p><p>In many cases, this is precisely what Bitcoin does to your financial information now. With all the tracing tech around, combined with the need to KYC yourself to use almost any exchange or service provider, anyone curious enough can simply query the publicly available information, draft a provably accurate and very precise picture of your finances, and know exactly who's financial profile that is.</p><p>The array of people that can now know this information extends from governments and banks, to almost any corporation or private individual. A notable \"step down\" from the traditional financial system when it comes to financial privacy.</p><h2 id=\"a-good-crypto-is-a-private-crypto\">A Good Crypto is a Private Crypto</h2><p>As great as Bitcoin sounds, it is having a hard time realizing its initial vision - even after 14 years of existence - precisely because of those privacy issues. Luckily, it's not the only digital currency around.</p><p>We've seen a few cryptocurrencies focus solely on this issue of privacy, making them very good candidates to be considered as true alternatives to cash and as great settlement layers for the web of today and tomorrow.</p><p>Amongst them there is Monero, which uses the very solid RingCT privacy protocol, or Firo with its more exotic privacy setup. We also have Zcash, a very well-known privacy coin - and many others. Each of them presents a different twist to the angle of privacy and comes with different codebases, strengths, and limitations.</p><p>But privacy generally comes with concessions in flexibility. While the examples mentioned above are great alternatives to Bitcoin because of the privacy they provide, their use-case is pretty much limited to person-to-person currency transactions. And although they accomplish their purpose well, a lot of potentials is left unexploited, especially as we've seen, in recent years, the advent of \"dapps\" (distributed applications) and of Web3, a new \"take\" on the web that promises data ownership and to do away with centralized parties.</p><p>Because of the limitations of privacy coins, they, unfortunately, cannot be used in any Dapp or be an important part of Web3.

Indeed, we can now go as far as saying that only\nthree things are guaranteed in life: taxation, death, and your personal\ninformation leaking to undesirable parties.\n\n“But I have nothing to hide, so why should I care?” one might say. Well, aside\nfrom having your identity stolen or your credit card filled up with fraudulent\npurchases, there’s one ugly fact that is barely understood by anyone: the risk\nof having your own thoughts being used against you. We know, this sounds...weird\nand vague, but the 2016 American presidential election is, as we’ll see, a\nfantastic example of this often-overlooked phenomenon associated with data\nmining.\n\nThe lessons we can learn from the Cambridge Analytica \"scandal\"\nNovember 2016 saw the election of a highly polarizing figure to the American\npresidency: Donald J. Trump. Whether one’s opinion on the man is negative or\npositive, there is a good chance that it is not neutral.\n\nIn 2016, Trump’s presidential campaign contracted Cambridge Analytica\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica], a big data firm that\nspecialized in analyzing data and selling the conclusions of their research to\ninterested parties, to help craft them narratives and political strategies.\nCambridge Analytica, on their “about” web page, touted an impressive 5000 data\npoints per person, targeting 220 million Americans\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about]\n, and used that data to create personality models for those people. That\ninformation, if you could afford it, was highly valuable to the Trump campaign’s\nambitions – and with the help of Cambridge Analytica, they gathered as much\ninformation on American voters as they possibly could. What do they like, or\nfear? What are the biggest issues? What triggers in them the most emotion? Who\ndo they talk to? Where do they hang out? What is the best way to catch their\nattention? The list was extensive\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html]\n.\n\nAs it turned out, even when people disliked Trump, they talked about him a lot,\nand often on social media. This created intense debates of ideas, creating the\nconditions for all the data Cambridge Analytica needed to advise the Trump\ncampaign on how to best move forward. Simply talking about him on social media\nis very likely to have contributed to his unexpected 306-to-232 victory.\n\nIt’s clear in hindsight that our discourse allowed Cambridge to craft very apt\npolitical narratives in order to appeal to a large part of the population –\noften alienated from common politicians - and provided all the information\nrequired to draft an election strategy. Ironically, the polemic around Trump –\nhow controversial he was as a political figure – directly contributed to his\nvictory. In the end, for slightly more than half of American voters, their data\nwas in effect used against them.\n\nAn institutional problem\nBut here’s the real cherry on top: every single political party, on either side\nof the aisle, every corporation, think tank, research firm, every special\ninterest group - they are all guilty of the exact same thing the Trump campaign\ndid with Cambridge Analytica. They all do it, almost without exception – the\nstakes are too high not to, and the bottom lines too attractive.\n\nAnd so, whenever you log online and discuss with others, do research, scroll up\nor down and spend X amount of seconds on this or that social media post, you\ngenerate data that not only could leak and expose you to malicious actors, but\nalso be used to profile and track you, and often against your own interests.\n\nIf you’re an online vendor, for example, then it’s your sales volume and page\ntraffic that will be collected sometimes by competitors, other times by the\neCommerce platform you’re using. And this valuable data can then be used to put\nyou out of business.\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nIt happened, it still happens, and it’ll keep happening. In fact, the problem of\nyour data being used against you go far beyond politics and can reach every\nsingle aspect of your life. It probably already did and you may not even be\naware of; how could you in the first place?\n\nSo how do we stop this? How do we protect our digital sovereignty and opt out of\nthis toxic dynamic?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems impossible if you use traditional web technologies, or\nwhat is increasingly being referred to as “web2”. With cookies, data sharing\npolicies, and monetization, there’s little to no way to escape from this. It’s\nfor “advertisement purposes”, they say. But we all certainly know better!\n\nFor example, what if you want to buy something online? Then you have to go on a\nwebsite that uses various plugins and third-party services. The most obvious\nbeing a payment processor and/or bank, a domain host, a website/server host, a\nweb platform (i.e., Wordpress and its plugins), an e-commerce solution (Amazon,\neBay, Shopify), etc. All of these third-parties collect their own set of data,\naccording to what they want to know about you (and how much they plan on\nmonetize your information), and then, they share it to even more partners that,\nin turn, monetize your data and probably share it with their own partners as\nwell. A simple purchase on Amazon spreads your personal information in all\ndirections with absolutely no control or consent on your end (and as we’ve seen, \nagreeing to pop up privacy and cookie policies does a poor job at slowing this\ndata pandemic down\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]]).\n\nGiven time, every problem finds its solution\nThis state of affairs was a big motivation behind our development of the \nParticl\nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] - a decentralized, peer-to-peer\nmarketplace with no middleman and no data collection whatsoever. All\ntransactions are made person-to-person with no unauthorized party having access\nto any single piece of information. Our privacy coin is also a major aspect of\nwhy it works; all trades are inherently private and anonymous, protecting both\nbuyers and sellers from having their data harvested by scrapers and unscrupulous\nintermediaries. Calling it the world’s safest and most private way to buy and\nsell anything online is no exaggeration because if no data is generated in the\nfirst place, then it can’t be collected. And that’s precisely how we roll!\n\nWith the state of the internet today, it is high time we get back to being\nskeptical and careful about who we share our data with; it’s never been as much\nof a problem as it is now and one would be ill-advised to think this will get\nbetter on its own, without us taking the appropriate steps required to protect\nourselves.

Trump. Whether one’s opinion on the man is negative or positive, there is a good chance that it is not neutral.</p><p>In 2016, Trump’s presidential campaign contracted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica\">Cambridge Analytica</a>, a big data firm that specialized in analyzing data and selling the conclusions of their research to interested parties, to help craft them narratives and political strategies. Cambridge Analytica, on their “about” web page, touted an impressive <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about\">5000 data points per person, targeting 220 million Americans</a>, and used that data to create personality models for those people. That information, if you could afford it, was highly valuable to the Trump campaign’s ambitions – and with the help of Cambridge Analytica, they gathered as much information on American voters as they possibly could. What do they like, or fear? What are the biggest issues? What triggers in them the most emotion? Who do they talk to? Where do they hang out? What is the best way to catch their attention? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">The list was extensive</a>.</p><p>As it turned out, even when people disliked Trump, they talked about him a lot, and often on social media. This created intense debates of ideas, creating the conditions for all the data Cambridge Analytica needed to advise the Trump campaign on how to best move forward. Simply talking about him on social media is very likely to have contributed to his unexpected 306-to-232 victory.</p><p>It’s clear in hindsight that our discourse allowed Cambridge to craft very apt political narratives in order to appeal to a large part of the population – often alienated from common politicians - and provided all the information required to draft an election strategy. Ironically, the polemic around Trump – how controversial he was as a political figure – directly contributed to his victory. In the end, for slightly more than half of American voters, their data was in effect used against them.</p><h2 id=\"an-institutional-problem\">An institutional problem</h2><p>But here’s the real cherry on top: every single political party, on either side of the aisle, every corporation, think tank, research firm, every special interest group - they are all guilty of the exact same thing the Trump campaign did with Cambridge Analytica. They all do it, almost without exception – the stakes are too high not to, and the bottom lines too attractive.</p><p>And so, whenever you log online and discuss with others, do research, scroll up or down and spend X amount of seconds on this or that social media post, you generate data that not only could leak and expose you to malicious actors, but also be used to profile and track you, and often against your own interests.</p><p>If you’re an online vendor, for example, then it’s your sales volume and page traffic that will be collected sometimes by competitors, other times by the eCommerce platform you’re using. And <a href=\"https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/\">this valuable data can then be used to put you out of business.</a> It happened, it still happens, and it’ll keep happening. In fact, the problem of your data being used against you go far beyond politics and can reach every single aspect of your life. It probably already did and you may not even be aware of; how could you in the first place?</p><p>So how do we stop this? How do we protect our digital sovereignty and opt out of this toxic dynamic?</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems impossible if you use traditional web technologies, or what is increasingly being referred to as “web2”. With cookies, data sharing policies, and monetization, there’s little to no way to escape from this. It’s for “advertisement purposes”, they say. But we all certainly know better!</p><p>For example, what if you want to buy something online? Then you have to go on a website that uses various plugins and third-party services. The most obvious being a payment processor and/or bank, a domain host, a website/server host, a web platform (i.e., Wordpress and its plugins), an e-commerce solution (Amazon, eBay, Shopify), etc. All of these third-parties collect their own set of data, according to what they want to know about you (and how much they plan on monetize your information), and then, they share it to even more partners that, in turn, monetize your data and probably share it with their own partners as well. A simple purchase on Amazon spreads your personal information in all directions with absolutely no control or consent on your end (and as we’ve seen, <a href=\"https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]\">agreeing to pop up privacy and cookie policies does a poor job at slowing this data pandemic down</a>).</p><h2 id=\"given-time-every-problem-finds-its-solution\">Given time, every problem finds its solution</h2><p>This state of affairs was a big motivation behind our development of the <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a></strong> - a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace with no middleman and no data collection whatsoever.

Calling it the world’s safest and most private way to buy and sell anything online is no exaggeration because if no data is generated in the first place, then it can’t be collected. And that’s precisely how we roll!</p><p>With the state of the internet today, it is high time we get back to being skeptical and careful about who we share our data with; it’s never been as much of a problem as it is now and one would be ill-advised to think this will get better on its own, without us taking the appropriate steps required to protect ourselves.

Over the past\ndecade or two, a worrying trend of centralization has taken place. Nowadays,\nonly a handful of large companies make up for an ever-increasing share of the\ntotal internet traffic worldwide. And the consequences are dire for each and\nevery single one of us…\n\n> the days of usenet, irc, the web...even email (w PGP)...were amazing.\ncentralizing discovery and identity into corporations really damaged the\ninternet.\n\nI realize I'm partially to blame, and regret it.\n\n— jack⚡️ (@jack) April 2, 2022\n[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1510314535671922689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow we empower monopolies to abuse our rights\nAs the internet continues on its clear trend of heavy centralization into the\nhands of just a few, the large corporations that control every facet of it now\nown more money and power than ever before. Indeed, forget about the “free”\ninternet of 10 or 15 years ago; a few profit and agenda-driven corporations now\ncontrol the vast majority of the web in ways you might not even expect.\n\nAccording to data by SimilarWeb [https://www.similarweb.com/], over 30% of US\nonline traffic is entirely controlled by five websites. Furthermore, only three\ncompanies share 80% of the cloud hosting of the top 10,000 websites — a trend\nthat is also very worrisome considering the sheer amount of power hosting\nproviders possess\n[https://www.pcmag.com/news/web-hosting-provider-namecheap-to-ban-russia-based-users-citing-ukraine]\n. It is even more mind-boggling to consider the levels of centralization in the\nvast world of online purchases: more than 75% is dominated by Amazon and eBay\nalone\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/270884/most-visited-websites-in-the-retail-sector-in-the-us/]\n!\n\nWith the grip they’ve got on the web, the world’s biggest tech companies are\nquickly accumulating information and power akin to the world’s most powerful\nstates, but are conversely in a position to be entirely subdued by the\nregulations of those state entities — they have as a consequence become\ninstrumental, essential aspects of the state surveillance apparatus of places\nlike China, but also of the USA and partners of the Five Eyes intelligence\nalliance [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes].\n\nBut that’s not all, they also often go well beyond the bounds of what they are\nlegally required to censor on their platforms, and that’s never been as accurate\nas in recent times. Aside from anti-competition practices like the censoring of\nspecific businesses or industries that may hurt their bottom line, as we’ve seen\nwith eBay/Paypal banning crypto mining hardware years ago\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1iyzkg/if_you_get_caught_selling_bitcoin_hardware_on/]\n, it is often seen as a responsibility for them to control and shape the\nnarrative for their interpretation of the “greater good” — from banning\nindividual politicians, to books, to countries, and all the way to entire\nsubjects of discourse. \n\nSocial media giants like Facebook and Twitter are especially guilty of that form\nof ideological control, but the corruption runs much deeper. Paypal will\nfamously refuse service to a myriad of categories of fully law-abiding citizens\n— sometimes on the simple basis of running Tor nodes\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/paypal-shuts-down-long-time-tor-supporter-no-recourse] \nor being of Russian or Belarusian nationality\n[https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/paypal-russia-ukraine]. Not even AirBNB\n[https://www.newsweek.com/airbnb-ban-russia-belarus-booking-rooms-abroad-ukraine-war-1695053] \nis above punishing individuals that correspond to broad categories of people on\nthe basis of their own political ideology. Sure, one can debate the reasons for\nsuch actions given certain geopolitical events, but as with any slippery slope\ngoes, where does it end? The truth of the matter is that these corporations have\nset very dangerous and flexible precedents that we should all unilaterally\nreject.\n\nAnd to that end, we must understand that it is our own habits that contribute to\nthis self-defeating and cannibalistic dynamic. When available on such a macro\nscale, data itself directly translates to money and influence\n[https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-companies-turn-your-data-into-money] for the\ncorporations that collect it — that’s why it’s become a core aspect of the\nbusiness models of giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.

The law was passed\nin the European parliament and targets European Union members and the companies\nthat wish to do business there – however, its presence has been noticeable in\nthe past few years all across the internet, especially in the form of a pop-up\non many websites asking you to confirm or alter the website’s use of cookies.\n\nThe Myth of GDPR and Consent-Based Privacy Regulations\nUnfortunately, the GDPR, and most other privacy or data-related government\nregulations, are little more than political grandstanding for\ndemocratically-elected governments to signal that they are \"doing something\"\nabout the increasingly prevalent issue of online privacy and data harvesting. As\na result, not much is changing in practice from a data collection and usage\nperspective. The same is true for most companies that have started to do\nmarketing out of their \"strong privacy policies\". It has become a marketing\nbuzzword, and when you dig deeper, you realize they are still collecting, using,\nsharing, and often losing your data.\n\nIn concrete terms, the GDPR and most other data regulations only require\ncompanies to disclose what data they collect and what they do with it. Then,\nthey have to get you to accept those terms and conditions. Oftentimes, if you\ndon't accept, you simply won’t be able to use the product or platform, or\nsometimes only in a limited manner. It is also an obvious fact that most people\nsimply accept TOCs without really reading them, since these \"requests for data\nuse\" pop up almost everywhere you go online now and just take too much time to\nproperly read through.\n\nOther times, for instance when you want to register to a marketplace like Amazon\nor Ebay, simply registering to the platform means that you agree to their TOCs\non data collection and usage. Don’t agree with them overlooking your every move?\nThen you are refused services and can’t do business on their platform. And you\nwould be well-advised not to accept these terms in many cases. After all,\ne-commerce data, such as data generated by online shoppers and vendors, is\nconstantly used to study certain business sectors in order to overtake them more\neffectively, especially in the case of Amazon\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015]\n. This results in honest sellers going out of business thanks to the very own\ndata they provided to e-commerce platforms. Deep down, do you really agree to\nthis when using a marketplace - or are you merely being coerced into accepting\nwhat's being imposed on you?\n\nThere seemingly is no real alternative to protect your data when browsing the\nweb anymore. All platforms collect your information, a lot of them lose it to\nhackers or due to gross negligence, and multiple parties still track your every\nmove, GDPR or not.\n\nThe Golden Promise of Decentralized E-Commerce\n\nDecentralized apps, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, and decentralized\nmarketplaces are in a prime position to tackle the issue from the core. The\nability to buy and sell anything with no middleman, directly person-to-person,\nand with no restrictions sends us back to the original principles of cash\ntransactions while transcending physical borders and promising equal access to\nall. Although in a nascent stage, it can be said for many to be the future of\ne-commerce.\n\nMany decentralized marketplaces, however, have a critical weakness that could\npotentially make them worse than even traditional marketplaces like Amazon. In\nthe case of traditional blockchain technology, all the data is tracked on a\npublic blockchain or over publicly-accessible networks. That oversight, combined\nwith increasingly sophisticated blockchain tracing and blockchain data mining,\nmeans all of that data is publicly viewable to anyone. So now, it's not just the\nmarketplace and its partners that have access to your data, it’s whoever is\ncurious enough to simply look it up. That’s bad if you're an individual, and\ncritically damaging if you are a business that ends up revealing their critical\ndata to competitors.\n\nIn some other cases, decentralized marketplaces are not entirely decentralized\nand various data sets go directly through third-parties or central authorities;\nessentially bringing us back to the very same core issues observed with typical\ne-commerce platforms built on traditional web technology.\n\nYes, the Solution is De-Commerce, BUT With Full Privacy\nThis is precisely the raison d’etre of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace]. We are delivering all the promises of\ndecentralized commerce (decommerce), but we're also fixing the critical issue of\ndata leaks and exposure by making it inherently private.\n\nEvery single aspect of the marketplace is private; from your transactions, to\nyour sales data, and all the way up to your browsing habits or even your network\nconnection. We don't track what you look for, how many seconds you look at one\nthing, or where your cursor wanders. The end result? Your personal and business\ninformation, shipping details, and network identity remain entirely private and\nsecure. You have total and uncompromising freedom to conduct business the way\nyou want to and with who you want to.\n\nOne thing is for certain: the best way to protect your data from leaks and abuse\nis to not have any data to collect in the first place. And that is precisely how\nParticl protects you. Whether you're buying or selling stuff on Particl, the\nmarketplace simply never ever generates any traceable or identifiable data about\nyou.

As you can imagine, this topic can rapidly\nlead to fiery debates on the level of privacy certain protocol implementations\noffer and as to why a certain currency was designed the way it is.\n\nWe’d like, today, to clarify our position on this topic and detail why we’ve\ndecided to follow this particular path.\n\n> Note: In this article, we often refer to RingCT transactions as “anon\ntransactions\". These are used as synonyms.\nTable of Contents\n * About Particl's Native Currency; PART\n * What are Particl Distributed Apps\n * The Need for Public Balances\n * About Particl’s Privacy\n * How Does RingCT Work?\n * Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\n * New Privacy Boons Abound\n * So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\n * Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\n * Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Particl’s Native Currency; PART\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in\nprivacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s\nimportant to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its\npurpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.\n\nTaken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same\nprivacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the\nmore rigid Cryptonote one.\n\nThis difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging\nthe Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the\nentire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers\nauditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and\nmore products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps\nmore importantly, that also means much more flexibility.\n\nAnd that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other\nprivacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and\nCT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its\nutility as more than just a private currency. \n\nThis added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style\nsmart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word\n“basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in\nitself as demonstrated by distributed apps like Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent\nTaproot developments. More on that shortly.\n\nWhat is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?\nWhen we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we\nhad a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed\napplications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus\nand all further design decisions follow that guiding line.\n\nWe are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted\nand censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical\ninternet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.\n\nIn that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange\nisn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is\nmore akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible\nenough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is\nachieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.\n\nIt is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve\ndesigned PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly\nwhat we intended it to do in the first place.\n\nWhat are Particl Distributed Apps\nTo give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed\napplications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized\nand private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything\nonline with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman,\ndata mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.\n\nThis marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the\nflexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P\nmessaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a\ndistributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the\nsmart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.\n\nAs PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content\nmoderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these\nfunctions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on\nwhether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more\nnuanced.\n\nThe Need for Public Balances\nRingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not\nprogrammable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios,\non various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation,\nParticl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and CT transactions\n[https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf]. This “protocol flexibility” is\none of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what\nit could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.\n\nWhat are Public Balances Used for?\nAt this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that\nrequire public balances to function:\n\n * The Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, including cold staking\n   and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking\n   rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra\n   layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to this\n   article\n   [https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/].\n * Particl's decentralized treasury which funds community initiatives.\n * The community governance system [https://ccs.particl.io/] which allows\n   stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.\n * The Particl Marketplace community moderation system which lets the users\n   moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the\n   platform.\n * The mobile wallet Particl Copay.\n * The light wallet Particl Electrum (desktop and mobile) which is expected to\n   power future mobile and web releases.\n * Hardware devices such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.\n\nAnd, although Particl Marketplace’s two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html] doesn’t rely\non public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs\ntogether to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by\nchecking out this article\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/].\n\nAs you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely\non public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright\nmandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force\nthe project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct\nopposition of our mission.\n\nWhat About Exchanges?\nAnother downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has\nto do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is\nbecoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the\nuse of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to\ndelisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect\nthemselves and ensure that they remain compliant.\n\nWith Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main\ntransaction type be transparent is a definite upside.\n\nAnd even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they\naccept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be\ninclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low\nliquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the\nexchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins,\nmay simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and\nreduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected\nas the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its\nmission.\n\nAuditing the Circulating Supply\nEverything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private\ntransactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that\nthe circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And\nalthough the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more\ntheoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.\n\nBy having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can\ndetermine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in\ncirculation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: “(…) the use of\ntransparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds\nthrough the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”. On that note, we\nhighly recommend reading Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of\nsupply auditability [https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html],\nhow it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs\ninvolved with this.\n\nIn our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve\nopted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable\nbenefit.\n\nTransaction Speed\nOne non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of\ntransaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use\nblock confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1\nconfirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it\ncontains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).\n\nThis speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others,\nnotably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance\nholds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout PART’s Privacy\nAlthough PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions\nwithin the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot\nwork over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most\nimportant selling points and development priorities. \n\nWhen debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking\nthe right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?\n\nAt its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not\nPART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous.\nWhether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as\nthe user privacy is solid enough. \n\nIs Particl private-by-default?\nLet’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t\n“private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.\n\nKeep in mind, Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of\napplications that respect your rights. The race to the top for the absolute most\nprivate cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That\nbeing said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as\nwe are just about to find out.\n\nKeeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy\nmaximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people\nthat may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like\ncutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.\n\nBut is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of\nthat privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be\nable to answer that question after.\n\nHow Does RingCT Work?\nRingCT [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] is a combination of the \nConfidential Transactions (CT) [https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf] \nand Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and\nring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.\n\nWhenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled\nup with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs\npose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being\nplausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.\n\nFor an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not\npossible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually\nparticipated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount\ntransferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and\ntheoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has\nproven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.\n\nWhat Contributes to Greater Privacy?\nTo keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy,\nand that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate\ntransactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.\n\nHow private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two\nfactors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease\nthe level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring\nsignatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a\ntransaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.\n\nOn the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly.\nBecause RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness\nincreases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different\nsources, to pick from.\n\nTo understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon\ntransaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real\nparticipants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the\nidentity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange,\na blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to\nhide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be\nidentified. \n\nThat's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network\nimproves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more\ndiverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.\n\nOn the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very\nimportant as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties\ncollecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an\nexchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this\nbecomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating\ntogether and sharing their collected data with each other.\n\nOpt-in Privacy and the Human Factor\nAt the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or\nnot it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.\n\nIf, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per\nday as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy at the\nprotocol level. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as\nmentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.\n\nIn the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the\nability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door\nto human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies,\nincluding private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations\nand best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. \n\n> Note: The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable\nto normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl\napplications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human\nerror by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.\nLeveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\nAs previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a\ncryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights,\nwith one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where\nlies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!\n\nTo understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example\nonce again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is\nprivate by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use\nRingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing\nan item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. \n\nAnd thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one\ntransaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100\nunique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as\nboth the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the\nescrow private smart-contract).\n\nAs is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace\ndramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day\non the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce\ntransactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online.\nSure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of\nhow many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized\nmarketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). \n\n> \"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\" - Kewde, Particl developer\nAs a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the\ntime of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar\nnumbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications\nlike the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless.\nThere's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs,\nor those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of\nParticl over other privacy coins.\n\nIn other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon\ntransactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that\nimproves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and\nfuture Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of\non-chain privacy as well.\n\nNew Privacy Boons Abound\nParticl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to\nwhat many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a\nparticularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made\non the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on\nParticl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.\n\nNot mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine\nthese breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve\nParticl's privacy and make its applications better for all. \n\nComplex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts\nIndeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts\non the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to\nkeep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for\nthe Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the\ncoin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded\nsmart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the\ntransacted amounts remain confidential.\n\nIf that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace,\nit could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given\ntransaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the\nbuyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning\nNetwork without leaving a trace. \n\nTaproot Scripts\nWith Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have\nbecome available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex\ntransactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you\ncan pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them\nfollowing a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just\nlike any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions\nnor the identities of the participants are exposed.\n\nThis opens a ton of opportunities, like for example entering and exiting the\nLightning Network more privately\n[https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/]\n, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps\nwith Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even \nmaking some core components of Particl quantum-proof\n[https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&t=4291].\nAnd that's just to name a few of the possibilites... \n\n> Note: In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT\ntransactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon\nentering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.\nSo, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\nUltimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options,\nthere are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all\ndepends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying\nto accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy\nsetup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to\naccomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. \n\nAnd although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins\nsuch as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of\ntransactions between the two networks at this present time, its privacy\npotential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of\nParticl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by\nusers.\n\nPART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's\necosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the\nother reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, the Particl team does not plan\nto switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in\nthe foreseeable future. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our\ncurrent model and are focusing on building applications that will organically\nraise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.\n\nThat being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the\nfuture depending on how things evolve.\n\nParticl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\nThe fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work\ntowards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. \n\nAs such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation\nthat mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's\nprivacy setup. \n\nAlso, in the next few Particl Desktop updates, you can expect new\nprivacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of\nhuman errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that\nautomatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions\n(send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy\nand everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our weekly development updates\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/] for more information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\nParticl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and\nis as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features\non a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although\nwe fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the\nParticl platform grows.\n\nAs part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private\ndecentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different\ncryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.\n\nThat means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your\nfavorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of\nboth chains at the same time. \n\nBy combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's\napp-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought\nwere possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then\nbe offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can\noffset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging\ninto the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both\nblockchains and a major victory for the people.\n\nOnce the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the\nsynergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy\nenthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and\nprivate applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by\nusing your favorite coin.\n\nIndeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to\nthe direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy\nand it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and\ntarget audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and\nwork in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we\nset out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and\ntears to day after day!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

As you can imagine, this topic can rapidly lead to fiery debates on the level of privacy certain protocol implementations offer and as to why a certain currency was designed the way it is.</p><p>We’d like, today, to clarify our position on this topic and detail why we’ve decided to follow this particular path.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In this article, we often refer to RingCT transactions as “anon transactions\". These are used as synonyms.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl's Native Currency; PART</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</a></li><li><a href=\"#about-part-s-privacy\">About Particl’s Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</a></li><li><a href=\"#leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</a></li><li><a href=\"#so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</a></li><li><a href=\"#particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</a></li><li><a href=\"#synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl’s Native Currency; PART</h2><p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in privacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s important to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its purpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Taken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same privacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the more rigid Cryptonote one.</p><p>This difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And although the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more theoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.</p><p>By having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can determine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in circulation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use block confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1 confirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it contains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).</p><p>This speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others, notably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance holds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-part-s-privacy\">About PART’s Privacy</h2><p>Although PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions within the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot work over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most important selling points and development priorities. </p><p>When debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking the right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?</p><p>At its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not PART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous. Whether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as the user privacy is solid enough. </p><h3 id=\"is-particl-private-by-default\">Is Particl private-by-default?</h3><p>Let’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t “private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of applications that respect your rights.</strong> The race to the top for the absolute most private cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That being said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as we are just about to find out.</p><p>Keeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy maximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people that may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like cutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.</p><p>But is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of that privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be able to answer that question after.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> is a combination of the <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">Confidential Transactions (CT)</a> and Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and ring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.</p><p>Whenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled up with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs pose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being plausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.</p><p>For an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not possible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually participated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount transferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&amp;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

These are used as synonyms.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl's Native Currency; PART</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</a></li><li><a href=\"#about-part-s-privacy\">About Particl’s Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</a></li><li><a href=\"#leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</a></li><li><a href=\"#so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</a></li><li><a href=\"#particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</a></li><li><a href=\"#synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl’s Native Currency; PART</h2><p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in privacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s important to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its purpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Taken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same privacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the more rigid Cryptonote one.</p><p>This difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And although the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more theoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.</p><p>By having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can determine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in circulation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use block confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1 confirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it contains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).</p><p>This speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others, notably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance holds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-part-s-privacy\">About PART’s Privacy</h2><p>Although PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions within the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot work over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most important selling points and development priorities. </p><p>When debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking the right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?</p><p>At its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not PART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous. Whether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as the user privacy is solid enough. </p><h3 id=\"is-particl-private-by-default\">Is Particl private-by-default?</h3><p>Let’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t “private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of applications that respect your rights.</strong> The race to the top for the absolute most private cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That being said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as we are just about to find out.</p><p>Keeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy maximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people that may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like cutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.</p><p>But is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of that privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be able to answer that question after.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> is a combination of the <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">Confidential Transactions (CT)</a> and Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and ring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.</p><p>Whenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled up with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs pose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being plausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.</p><p>For an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not possible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually participated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount transferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&#x26;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * The window title now correctly reflects the chain that the application is\n   started with, so as to more readily distinguish between running the\n   application on testnet or mainnet.\n\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Fixes an edge case when an order request might fail to be made despite\n   sufficient funds (and utxos) being available.\n * Fixes an order request not being able to be progressed by either buyer or\n   seller after being made, if the seller escrow amount required is 0.\n * Ignores received listing messages if the listing in the message has expired\n   by the time the listing message is processed. This means that the processing\n   of actual, valid listing messages are processed a lot sooner rather than\n   spending time processing messages that are not going to be useful to begin\n   with (i.e., faster time to see messages when joining a market), as well as\n   preventing the unnecessary updating of the \"pending new items\" refresh button\n   count with expired listings.\n * Adjusts the checking of available utxos when publishing listings to a market.\n   This should provide some measure of preventing cases where listings are\n   published without their associated images.\n * Prevents an order status from incorrectly being updated if the buyer attempts\n   to cancel an order in the \"escrow locked\" status but the seller has already\n   completed the escrow transaction and the buyer node simply has not received\n   the updated status message). Previously, the order status was incorrectly\n   updated to the \"cancelled\" status despite the cancellation request failing;\n   the status is now untouched if the cancellation fails.\n * Fixes listing and market images not being correctly removed from the\n   filesystem.\n * Removes the current listings associated with a market as well when a market\n   is un-joined, rather than leaving the listings and waiting for the listing to\n   expire before removing it.\n * Combines the market ID and applicable market key into a single value: rather\n   than needing to copy out 2 values for sharing access to a market, only one\n   value is now needed. The same applies for the market joining: only a single\n   value is needed to be entered, rather than 2 separate values.\n * Removes the 'Edit Product' button and instead places it inside of a separate\n   \"product info\" modal: this is to more clearly distinguish between editing of\n   a product template and a market-specific template (which tends to cause\n   confusion when a market template requires editing but the product template\n   edit action is more visible and tended to be used more readily instead).\n * Changes the displayed graphic and accompanying text when browsing a market\n   with no listings: a different graphic (and text) is now displayed when the\n   blockchain is still syncing, to clearly distinguish why there may be no\n   listings currently available.\n * Re-sends the escrow complete message in addition to the shipping message when\n   a seller re-sends the order status at the shipping step. If the buyer side\n   was missing the escrow complete status message then re-sending the shipping\n   status alone is insufficient to update the buyer status, so both the escrow\n   complete and shipping status messages are resent at the shipping status step.\n * Updates the error to more accurately reflect the reason for failing to\n   publish a listing when the listing itself is successfully published, but one\n   or more images in the listing are not correctly published.\n * Fixes the display of an order item's shipping value to correctly display the\n   actual shipping value used.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs Particl Desktop 3.1.1 fixes various bugs and issues that were encoutered by\nlive users, we invite those users to give this new update a spin and report back\nif any issue still persists (which shouldn't be the case).\n\nWe thank you all in the community for testing Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace extensively and reporting back.

It improves the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction,\nmaking the P2P network more efficient.\n\nFixing Dynamic Marketplace Listing Fees\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower.\n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability had been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, at some point in the past, the fee\ntarget amount dropped below a particular threshold and the code didn't allow it\nto change anymore (up or down). This hardfork fixed that issue by clamping the\nminimum amount it can change to 1 sat, making the feature functional and\nallowing stakers to adjust listing fees again. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] to learn how you can\nhelp reduce the marketplace listing fees.\n\nAdding Dynamic Supply\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThe hardfork also re-enabled a small number of disabled outputs from people who\nhad missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and haven’t\nput up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the steps\nmentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].

While this integration is still in the testing phase and not yet\nready for a full production roll-out, it represents a major step forward and has\nbeen updated on BasicSwap's dev Github branch.\n\nOur next focus is addressing the management of change during the conversion from\nregular LTC to MWEB balances. Currently, the change from such conversions also\nbecomes MWEB but remains in the regular address instead of transitioning to\nMWEB. Resolving this will be one of our main goals in the coming week.\n\nNew Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've recently rolled out updates for two coin cores: Firo and Litecoin. As\nalways, we strongly recommend that you keep your core nodes updated to the\nlatest versions, which is particularly important in this instance as both Firo\nand Litecoin have upcoming hardforks — Firo with the introduction of Lelantus,\nand Litecoin with the full integration of MWEB.\n\nFor guidance on how to update your coin cores, please refer to the step-by-step\ninstructions provided in the Particl Academy here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nWe've successfully completed testing BasicSwap's installation wizard version 2.0\nfor Windows last week and are now testing it for OSX. It is nearly ready to\npre-release it.\n\nAs a new addition, the updated installer now lets you update the DEX, and also\nincludes additional scripts to update its dependencies and launch the\napplication (not just install it) by double-clicking on an icon.\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe are making steady progress on finalizing version 2.1 of BasicSwap's user\ninterface, and need a few extra days to finish everything up. \n\nNote that, this week, we've incorporated changes to the user interface to\nsupport the new Litecoin balance types. Additionally, we've made the necessary\nmodifications to accommodate multi-wallet functionality, which will be required\nif coin cores need this feature.\n\nMiscellaneous ✅\n * Investigate and fix issue with wallet unlock getting stuck at \n   SecureMsgWalletUnlocked\n * Make BasicSwap multi-wallet capable\n * Rename rpc_callback -> call_rpc\n\nPrivacy Coins Getting Delisted ⚡️\n> #Monero [https://twitter.com/hashtag/Monero?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] and\nother #privacy\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] coins like \n#DASH [https://twitter.com/hashtag/DASH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] or #FIRO\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIRO?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] will soon be\ndelisted from most if not all major centralized exchanges\n\nBut fear not!

The DEX is designed to be\ncompletely resilient, operating without centralized control or interference.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, with planned milestones such as web compatibility, light\nnodes, remote services, and more coin listings, the year promises to be a\nsignificant one for BasicSwap.

We\nare currently investigating that issue and will incorporate its fix in the\nupcoming Particl Desktop 3.3.1 release.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ?\nWe are still at the early stages of building the seller app and have been\npreparing for its development cycle, collecting feedback and suggestions from\nsome of the vendors currently selling on the marketplace at the same time.\n\nNotably, this week we've been working on the capability of the seller app to\nwork with plugins along with an external group of developers that is exploring\nthe feasibility of building a liquidity engine specifically designed to support\nsellers on the marketplace.\n\nIf you have any seller-related feature requests, suggestions, or ideas, we'd\nlove to hear about them. The app provides a quick way to deploy and experiment\nwith different seller-related features, so the more input we receive on that\nend, the more we can work with!\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've pushed a couple of commits to BasicSwap's codebase while a\ncouple of others are still pending submission. \n\n * Accepted bids will timeout if the peer does not respond within an hour after\n   the bid expires.\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md#0060]\n * Ensure messages are always sent from and to the expected peer addresses.\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/doc/release-notes.md#0060]\n\nWe're currently in the process of wrapping up a few changes/fixes to BasicSwap\nbefore shifting more priority to the next key milestone, SMSG 2.0. You can track\nthe progress as it happens here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nSMSG 2.0 is indeed a critical item towards our vision of an independent,\nprivate, and pro-liberty economy as it provides Particl dApps like BasicSwap and\nthe marketplace the required level of scalability to support widespread\nadoption. Moreover, it will facilitate the availability of Particl dApps over\nthe clearweb (\"Web2\"), as well as from its very own and decentralized web\nenvironment.\n\nWe will keep you updated on this topic and publish multiple articles explaining\nSMSG 2.0 in more details on Particl News once its development cycle officially\nbegins.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've unfortunately been unable to release the new BasicSwap GUI this week as we\nhave been working on resolving some bugs, notably in relation to its dark theme.\nWe've fixed the good majority of them today and are wrapping up the last pieces\nfor imminent release.\n\nAs we mentioned last week, the new GUI will be released in two phases, the first\none comprising of the revamped GUI codebase, including the features announced in\nprevious progress reports, and the second one introducing a set of features that\nhave been requested by the community only recently. This includes, for example,\nindicators highlighting what orders can be taken partially.\n\nAs part of this second release, we also want to explore more experimental\nfeatures available on the codebase, but not yet the GUI, such as the grouping of\norders, which would allow orders of the same rate to be \"merged as one\" on the\norder book, but whether they will be able to be released at this stage, or\nwhether it is too early, is yet to be determined.\n\nMarket Making Script ✅\nWe've completed the majority of the work in relation to BasicSwap's market\nmaking script. While stile basic in itself, it allows you to easily maintain\nliquidity on BasicSwap without having to manually complete several steps.\n\nThis involves, notably, automatic republishing of orders onto the book,\nautomatic price adjustments based on current market rates (with programmable\ncustom profit margins for arbitrage), automatically bidding on orders that meet\nspecific criteria, and so forth.\n\nAt present, we are in the process of connecting our market making script to a\nliquidity provider partner. This will enable you to maintain a constant ratio of\nbalances (e.g. BTC, XMR, etc.) when carrying out swaps on the platform. To put\nit simply, you will have the capacity to offer liquidity for different assets\nwhilst ensuring the balances stay relatively the same as you use BasicSwap, thus\nallowing you to benefit from the margins without having to manually adjust your\nbalances every time.\n\nWe are also assessing other options for providing liquidity, such as connecting\nBasicSwap with other market making systems such as Hummingbot, for example, but\nthis is slated for a later time this year.\n\nParticl & PIVX on Twitter Space Later Today ?️\nToday this Friday at 2:30 PM, Particl and PIVX will be live on Twitter Space \ndiscussing current events in the crypto market and the role of privacy in\nachieving personal liberty.\n\n> Thrilled to be hosting a live Space with @_PIVX\n[https://twitter.com/_PIVX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] and @thegreatestdoc\n[https://twitter.com/thegreatestdoc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] this Friday at 2:30 PM\nEST!\n\nJoin us as we discuss #PIVX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/PIVX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw], @BasicSwapDEX\n[https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw], and explore the\nsignificance of #privacy\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] for our\nliberties ?\n\nMake sure to stay for the Q&A https://t.co/vy7Z8x5jBh… https://t.co/5wJCCTKX49\n\n— Particl (@ParticlProject) March 5, 2023\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1632471154895077382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nBe sure to join us in this discussion and ask any question you may have in the\nQ&A period towards the end of the stream!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Get it now to experience the most\nup-to-date Particl experience.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-mainnet/]Earlier this week, we've\nreleased the widely-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.3 on mainnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-mainnet/], officially marking the\nbeginning of the new development cycle as detailed in this extensive blog post\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nThis release is notable for its decoupling of Particl Core from the desktop\napplication, an important step leading us right into the process of evolving the\nParticl ecosystem into a more modular architecture.\n\nMainnet Status ?️\nFollowing the mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, we've received reports of\na couple of minor issues which we are actively working to resolve. The fixes\nwill be implemented in a 3.3.1 release soon.\n\nOther than that, we are pleased to report that the launch has been successful\nand without any major issues. This indicates that we are ready to start\ndevelopment on the standalone seller app.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ✅\nWith Particl Desktop 3.3 now available on mainnet, we are beginning to develop\nthe standalone seller app, an essential component of our renewed vision for the\nmarketplace dApp. This app will serve a variety of purposes in the ecosystem,\nand become a major factor as we move forward.\n\nIts functions can be divided into three distinct categories:\n\nRemote Services Management: This suite of capabilities provides the means to\nmanage connections to external services such as WooCommerce, inventory\nmanagement systems, and liquidity providers.\n\nThe Particl Seller App is designed to integrate external services, essentially\ngranting sellers access to the ever-expanding range of eCommerce technology,\nplatforms, and plugins, and ultimately allowing them to leverage their\nadvantages when using Particl marketplace.\n\nInventory and Listing Management: This category deals with anything Particl\ninventory and listing related. This include the management of listing data,\nprices, and publishing methodology, among other functions.\n\nNotably, the app will enable sellers to automatically republish listings on\nParticl Marketplace after expiration and to adjust PART prices in accordance\nwith current coin value. This will significantly improve the seller experience\nand minimize the time needed to manage and maintain Particl listings.\n\nMarketplace Activities: This category encompasses all activities related to the\nmarketplace, including order management, customer communication, escrow\nprogression, and more.\n\nOverall, this app will provide sellers with all the necessary functions to\noperate a business on Particl without needing to download Particl Desktop.\nAdditionally, its external connection capabilities will make it easier to draw\nin sellers who are already active on other eCommerce platforms, making it\neasier-than-ever to integrate Particl Marketplace into their business flow and\nleverage its benefits, without as many of its convenience drawbacks.\n\nOver time, many of these features will be incorporated into the new desktop\nclient, which will be substantially improved during the new development cycle,\nas well as future versions of the marketplace including web and mobile versions.\nHowever, this standalone application will expedite the process of bringing these\nmuch-needed features to life, allowing the team to more rapidly begin work on a\nmobile/web version of the marketplace that focuses on buyers; the ultimate goal\nbeing to cater to both buyers and sellers' needs as fast as possible for\nadoption purposes.\n\nBe sure to look out for an upcoming blog post on the Particl Seller App and our\nstrategy and rationale behind it on Particl News!\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.
