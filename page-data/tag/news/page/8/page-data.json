The OMP Library was written some\ntime ago by Particl’s developer Kewde, but the team wanted to make some\nmodifications to it and run proper testing, specifically related to the buy\nflow, before putting it onto mainnet.\n\nThe OMP Library is a major improvement to the backend of the Particl Open\nMarketplace, allowing for example escrows to process transactions automatically\nusing Confidential Transactions or for listings to have more attributes.\n\nWe are happy to say that the integration of the blind escrow system into the\nmarketplace is now complete.\n\nFinish the OMP Library Integration Tests (In Progress)\nThe next step is to finalize the OMP Library integration by running the whole\nsuite of automated tests the team has built over the last two years. These\nautomated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break\nthem in any possible way.\n\nWhen a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be\nupdated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until\nit finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results,\nwe would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until\nafter these tests are complete.\n\nWe initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC\nBlockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the\nconferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead\nMarketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open\nMarketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason\nwhy we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it\nback home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the\nfinal testnet build before the first mainnet release.\n\nNote that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To\nthe contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a\nmajority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a\nclear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We\nactually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will\ncommunicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.\n\nWhy are These Tests so Important?\nThese automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes\nParticl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put\nout in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it\nis as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.\n\nThe tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components.\nIn fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved\nonto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there\nwill always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a\nhuge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the\nsecurity of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while\nit’s on the track racing.\n\nTake the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the\nseller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds\nlocked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that\ncould potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can\nimagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet\nenvironment!\n\n> Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track\nracing. — Joe Fisher\nThat doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after\nit launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time\nconsuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and\nare fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of\ntesting before unleashing on mainnet.\n\nThis is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet\nrelease.\n\nIntegrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)\nOnce the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate\nthe last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick\nto complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the\nbackend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works\nflawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the\nintegration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to\nParticl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy\nflow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.\n\nLast Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)\nAs soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the\ncommunity, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release\nof the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nBecause the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few\nmonths, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the\nimportant thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as\nthey will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being\nreleased on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.\n\nNevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet\nclient before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be\nrunning a short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500\nworth of PART to the best bug hunters out there! We will reveal all of the\ndetails once we publish the testnet build.\n\nWe estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a\nduration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard\ndate, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major\nissue arises.\n\nThen, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live\non mainnet will be upon us!\n\nMainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\nThis is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open\nMarketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto\nmainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with\nreal funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet\nrun of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.\n\nSo When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?\nAt this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that\nthe tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed\nwithin a pretty short time frame of a few days, though. Then, once it’s done, 1\nto 2 days will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last\ntestnet will be released to the public for a period of approximately 1 week, if\nall goes smoothly. We definitely want and will communicate a more precise\ntimeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library\nintegration tests. However, this development update should still be able to give\nyou a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.\n\nIn the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at\nthe Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to maximize the exposure of\nthe mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in\nlight of the new contacts we’ve made.\n\nAfter nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there! All\nfeatures intended to be part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nhave been integrated and are going through their final automated testing rounds.\nAlthough we are not able to give a definitive date for the mainnet release\ntoday, we will be communicating one very shortly.\n\nHang tight because from here on out, things will get very interesting!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews Flash: Particl Bulletproofs Audit by Quarkslab\nOn a non-marketplace related note, we are pleased to announce that Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] has started auditing our Bitcoin-based\nBulletproofs integration. Quarkslab is a world-renowned security firm having\naudited codes and projects like OpenSSL\n[https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/], \nVeraCrypt\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/veracrypt-audit-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities,32878.html]\n, OpenVPN [https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-assessment-of-openvpn.html], and,\ninterestingly enough, Monero’s Bulletproofs implementation\n[https://blokt.com/news/monero-fixes-all-bulletproof-protocol-vulnerabilities-found-in-second-security-audit]\n.\n\nOnce the audit is done, we’ll look into the report, address any potential issue\nit identifies, and start planning ahead for a hardfork of Particl’s RingCT with\nBulletproofs on mainnet.\n\nWe will keep you informed as details come in!\n\nWelcome — Quarkslab [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\nEvery security issue is different, every solution must be\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]www.quarkslab.com [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming up?\nWith all the intended features for the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nbeing integrated, part of the development team has now started working on the\nnext features that will be integrated into the marketplace. Note that none of\nthese new features will be included in the first mainnet version of the Open\nMarketplace. As the build is pretty stable right now, we do not want to\nintegrate new functions that could delay the mainnet release.\n\nQuantity Management\nA must-have for vendors running a business out of their sales. Quantity\nManagement is like a lite version of the full Inventory Management system we\nplan on integrating later during the Beta phase of development. It allows\nvendors to set quantities for their listings and lets people bid multiple times\non the same listings if the vendors set their quantity accordingly.\n\nFuture Features\nThe Particl team also has other features it would like to focus on first after\nthe mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. We still want to go through a few\nother development meeting sessions before communicating what other features\nother than Quantity Management will be worked on first. We will let you know all\nof the information after the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the Development Update part of this Community Update.

These automated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break them in any possible way.</p><p>When a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be updated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until it finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results, we would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until after these tests are complete.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-3/1-kumyXfSTRhXArYocWrrNHw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>We initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC Blockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the conferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead Marketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open Marketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason why we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it back home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release.</p><p>Note that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To the contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a majority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a clear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We actually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will communicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.</p><h3 id=\"why-are-these-tests-so-important\">Why are These Tests so Important?</h3><p>These automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes Particl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put out in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it is as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.</p><p>The tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components. In fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved onto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the marketplace.</p><p>In fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there will always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a huge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the security of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while it’s on the track racing.</p><p>Take the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the seller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds locked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that could potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can imagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet environment!</p><blockquote>Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track racing. — Joe Fisher</blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after it launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time consuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and are fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of testing before unleashing on mainnet.</p><p>This is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet release.</p><h3 id=\"integrate-the-omp-library-into-particl-desktop-pending-\">Integrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)</h3><p>Once the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate the last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick to complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the backend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works flawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the integration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to Particl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy flow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.</p><h3 id=\"last-testnet-build-before-mainnet-pending-\">Last Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)</h3><p>As soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the community, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace!</p><p>Because the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few months, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the important thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as they will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being released on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.</p><p>Nevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet client before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be running a <strong>short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500 worth of PART to the best bug hunters out there</strong>! We will reveal all of the details once we publish the testnet build.</p><p>We estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a duration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard date, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major issue arises.</p><p>Then, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live on mainnet will be upon us!</p><h3 id=\"mainnet-release-of-the-open-marketplace-pending-\">Mainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)</h3><p>This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto mainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with real funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet run of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.</p><h3 id=\"so-when-is-it-coming-out-on-mainnet-exactly\">So When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-3/1-MOqFHxGVVDtIDKXSgp-XCg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that the tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed within a pretty short time frame of <strong>a few days</strong>, though. Then, once it’s done, <strong>1 to 2 days</strong> will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last testnet will be released to the public for a period of <strong>approximately 1 week, </strong>if all goes smoothly. <strong>We definitely want and will communicate a more precise timeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library integration tests. </strong>However, this development update should still be able to give you a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.</p><p>In the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at the Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to <strong>maximize the exposure</strong> of the mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in light of the new contacts we’ve made.</p><p><strong>After nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there!

Week\nLast week, the Particl team met in New York City to participate in the NYC\nBlockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events] by\nhaving a booth at both the Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus. There, the\nteam demonstrated the long-awaited Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet, for the\nfirst time ever and was able to make a huge leap forward by connecting directly\nwith the crypto community.\n\nToward the Particl Open Marketplace\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nThe coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one. Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for…\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\n\nIf you would like to read about Part 1 and Part 3 of this Community Update, then\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * Development Update\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-3-4d53bcf621af]\n\nMagical Crypto Conference\nThe team’s first stop was at the Magical Crypto Conference\n[https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/], an event organized by the “magical\nfriends” — Charlie Lee, Samson Mow, Ricardo Spagni, and WhalePanda. In\ncomparison to Consensus, MCC aims to be the go-to conference for the true crypto\nfans and cypherpunks. It is an environment that is safe from all the corporate\ninfluence of Consensus and focuses on the tech moving forward. And magical it\nwas…\n\nDay 1 of MCC was Particl’s cupcake day. In fact, Particl saw its first\nsuccessful marketplace transaction take place on mainnet\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1127237342920675328]! This is an enormous\nmilestone for the project and it really started the week on the right foot,\nespecially as the whole process happened very smoothly and without any hiccup.\n\nBecause this event was mostly attended by long-time Bitcoin fans and people who\ngenerally don’t like the whole corporate/altcoin aspect of Consensus, we\nexpected to be met with skepticism and be put on the spot. However, we were\npleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl\nOpen Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the\nbooth.\n\nMax Keiser at the Particl boothUsually, most people don’t like when a platform\nis exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has\nproven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its\nnative coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain\nprivate, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to.\nThe ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform\nintended to be used by all crypto users.\n\nOne of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest\nfrom the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all,\nthe first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto\nusers, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.\n\nWe can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors,\ndevelopers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore\ncrypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable\nfeedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to\nshowcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical\nCrypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure\nand is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!\n\nConsensus\nWhereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know\nabout the Open Marketplace, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] meant business!\n\nAs you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty\nexpensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping\n$1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people,\nmaking the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This\nactually turned out to be a good thing.\n\nLike many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the\nprevious edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing\naround for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a\nsour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical\nCrypto Conference was created in the first place.\n\nSmaller but Better Crowd\nThis year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The\nquality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts\nand figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto\nfans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives,\nmany team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all\nresulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain\nsolutions could disrupt their respective industries.\n\nAnd as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team.\nIt has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major\nvendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a\ntrustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact,\nwe have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of\nParticl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their\nbusinesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with\nthem.\n\nDisrupting of Supply Chains\nParticl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers\nand vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what\nsome of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that\nthe Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow\nsystem, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how\nsupply chains operate in a major way.\n\nThe Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by\ngetting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely\nmoving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various\napplications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply\nchains, hiding R&D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading\ngoods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.\n\nFrom all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed\nto be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the\nOpen Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely\navoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely\ngroundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.\n\nSeeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one\nof the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.\n\nGreat Connections\nAside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve\nhad quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the\nspace, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it\nless chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.\n\nWe are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and\nwe’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors\nthat have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.\n\nInsights Right From the Trenches\nNot only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those\ndiscussions have also been extremely insightful to the team. The fact that so\nmany people came with so many different backgrounds and areas of expertise, it\ngave us a lot of different perspectives and ways to see how Particl’s Open\nMarketplace could be used in real-life situations. Suffice to say, the potential\nof this marketplace extends much further than just being a cool marketplace for\ncrypto users.\n\nNYC Blockchain Week Recap\nThe NYC Blockchain Week may very well turn out to be a very impactful event for\nParticl. The Particl team is coming back home with a strong sense of mission\naccomplished. We’ve had the opportunity to meet with so many of the users we’re\nbuilding this platform for, collect a vast amount of feedback from them and get\ndecent exposure in the heart of crypto.\n\nThe whole team that attended the conferences feels like this entire week has\nbeen a solid validation of what we’ve known all along — Particl is a highly\ndisruptive marketplace that looks and feels right. The only difference now is\nthat we’ve met some of the very people that need this marketplace the most, and\nwe are all as motivated and optimistic about the future of this project as we’ve\never been!\n\nA Rare Working Blockchain Product\nOnce again, just like the few recent conferences we’ve attended, Particl seemed\nto be among the minority of booths with a working product on display. This was\nsomething that impressed a lot of people.\n\nSometimes, the booth would be so busy that you would need to explain Particl a\nbit further away from the computers. Then, when the person would ask for a video\ndemo, they’d be completely surprised to learn that we actually had a working\nversion of it on mainnet just a few meters away. This was a reaction we’ve seen\ntime and time again, people are still not used to the fact that a blockchain\nproduct could be live on mainnet, and look so damn good.\n\nBest Testing Ground\nOne very interesting aspect of our week in NYC was the fact that for the entire\nduration of the two conferences we’ve attended, the Particl Open Marketplace has\nbeen thoroughly tested on mainnet and under many different circumstances. We\nhave observed no issue whatsoever, and we feel very confident moving forward\nwith this product.\n\nWhat Now?\nWe want to continue traveling the world and keep reaching out to more people.\nWe’ve also made great friendships and connections with people in the space with\nwhom we want to keep spending time with. This is the reason why we’ll actively\nbe looking around at other conferences and keep an eye out for any interesting\nevent.\n\nAs such, we likely will have a few team members going to San Francisco on the\n25th and 26th of June for the Bitcoin2019 conference\n[https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/]. We will announce more details shortly,\nbut if you are planning on going as well, definitely drop us a message and let’s\ntry to meet up at the conference!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the NYC Blockchain Week Recap part of this Community Update.

Whereas last year was focused on building the base\nlayer for the Open Marketplace, this year has been all about refining it and\nstarting to add new features on top of it. That doesn’t mean, however, that the\nonly milestones reached this year were about the marketplace! Here’s a complete\nlist of all the accomplishments and deliverables Particl had so far this year:\n\nParticl Copay 5.4.1 Released\n[https://particl.news/particl-copay-5-4-1-released-3fb50d486a44] (Jan 17th): A\nnew version of Particl Copay was released on the 17th of January and marked a\nrenewed active development for Particl’s mobile application.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the\nnetwork as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the\nfunctioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing\nmessages around the network and make the governance system work.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace\nwould be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect\nour commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first\nmainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions\nenabled by default.\n\nAdditionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the\nBitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after\nBitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the\nrelease of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of\ntime the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the\nescrow mechanism.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the network as well as paid SMSG messages. Paid SMSG messages are crucial to the functioning of the Open Marketplace on mainnet as they are used to carry listing messages around the network and make the governance system work. The hardfork went through without any issue and the network is now ready for the mainnet release of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83\"><strong>Hardfork Successful</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/hardfork-successful-8480249aac83\"><em>?

While we initially intended to move entirely on Discord and put Telegram in read-only mode, our travels around the world have made it clear we couldn’t do that as some countries exclusively use Telegram. Nevertheless, the team has been mostly moved over there and our Discord server will be the main platform we’ll focus on moving forward even though we will keep our Telegram channel open.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\"><strong>Particl is Officially Moving to Discord</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\"><em>The Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever since we abandoned Slack more than a year…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-officially-moving-to-discord-57c6bb52e365\">particl.news</a></p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><strong>Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 Released</strong></a><strong> (March 8th):</strong> On the 8th March, Particl reached a big milestone by releasing its Open Marketplace Alpha 2.0 on testnet.

This release marked the completion of the base layer of the marketplace, meaning that the development team could now start focusing on adding features on top of it.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><strong>Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 Release &amp; Development Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-alpha-v2-0-release-development-update-d14f1df6734d\"><em>It’s finally here!

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

This hardfork introduced both multi-signature cold staking capabilities to the network as well as paid SMSG messages.

In fact, this event, which we were a Gold sponsor for, marked the first big conference and kick-off point for our journey of creating awareness and introducing Particl’s first dApp, the Open Marketplace, to the crypto community. Not only was the Particl booth one of the very popular one around, but it also proved to be an excellent exercise for the team ahead of the two other major conferences Particl would be having a booth at: Consensus and Magical Crypto Conference.

While it was initially announced that the marketplace would be released without privacy transactions, the team had decided to respect our commitment to privacy that we are making to our users by releasing the first mainnet version of the marketplace with the OMP Library and private transactions enabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, because the entire Open Marketplace had been built using the Bitcoin Core 0.18 codebase, we opted to push the official release only after Bitcoin itself would update its core to the 0.18 version. In the end, the release of Bitcoin Core 0.18 was delayed for about a month, an extra period of time the Particl team used to fine-tune and improve the OMP Library and the escrow mechanism.

Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for the biggest event of the year in\ncrypto: the NYC Blockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events]. There, \nthey will finally reveal the Open Marketplace on the real Particl network, the\nmainnet, for the first time ever!\n\nAnd that Open Marketplace is not “just another marketplace”, it is a world\nfirst: a decentralized marketplace, fully autonomous and private, for a new\ncustomer and seller experience\n\nIf you don’t know about it, let us present it to you!\n\nIn this blog post, we will tell you about:\n\n * The Particl Open Marketplace\n * The NYC Blockchain Week\n * The road to the marketplace & how we got there\n * The current state of development, and more\n\nWhat’s the Particl Open Marketplace?\nSimply put, the Open Marketplace is an entirely decentralized marketplace where\nyou can buy and sell products and services to anyone else in the world, in full\nprivacy. Think Alibaba or eBay, but on the blockchain and without a company\nbeing in control of the platform. This means there is no risk of a third party\nusing its position of power to spy on you and impose its arbitrary rules and\nfees.\n\nThe marketplace is fully autonomous, meaning that it doesn’t require any\nthird-party or intermediary to function. It instead restores the balance of\npower back to the people by using a combination of blockchain and peer-to-peer\ntechnologies. The absence of intermediaries alone is enough to bring the cost of\nselling on the platform to a near-zero level.\n\nThis means both vendors and buyers end up with more money in their pockets.\nBecause vendors make more profit per sale, they can reduce their prices to\nincrease their volume and beat the competition. This, in turn, means customers\ncan potentially gain access to cheaper products!\n\nThe Particl Open Marketplace also utilizes a combination of various security\nmeasures and privacy protocols to ensure that none of your data can be accessed\nby anyone. It is a “private by default” marketplace, meaning that you don’t need\nto take any extra step in order to protect your data — it’s just the way Particl\nis.\n\nParticl at the NYC Blockchain Week\nThe NYC Blockchain Week is a series of many crypto events happening within the\nsame timeframe in New York. It attracts the biggest names in the industry,\nshowcases the best blockchain projects, and unites the many different crypto\ncommunities together for one exciting week. In a way, the NYC Blockchain Week is\nto crypto what the World Cup is to football.\n\nParticl in NYC\nParticl is, of course, going to be a part of this event. In fact, you’ll be able\nto come to meet us, right at our booth, at either Magical Crypto Conference or \nConsensus. That’s right! We’ll be having a booth at the two best conferences NYC\nBlockchain Week 2019 has to offer and we’ll be demonstrating the Particl Open\nMarketplace, in exclusivity, on mainnet!\n\nMagical Crypto Conference (MCC)—11th & 12th of May\nThe Magical Crypto Conference [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/] is a\npure crypto-community conference. It is organized and hosted by the well known\n“Magical Crypto Friends”, a group of 4 influencers in the crypto space: Charlie\nLee (Litecoin), Samson Mow (Blockstream CSO), Ricardo Spagni (Monero), and\n“WhalePanda”\n\nThis is the perfect place to meet potential Open Marketplace users and is the\nreason why we are so excited to be having a booth at this event. In fact, as MCC\nis more of a pure crypto community conference, it attracts some of the crypto\npioneers and people that are already deeply interested by the true vision of\ncryptocurrencies, privacy, decentralization, and personal freedom. A simple look\nat the speaker list [https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/#speakers] should\ngive you a good idea of the type of people that will attend the event.\n\nConsensus by Coindesk—13th to the 15th of May\nStarted by Coindesk in 2015, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] is one of the first crypto\nconference ever and the most prestigious. It has become the biggest\ncryptocurrency event in the world and is a place where people mean business.\n\nThis will be the ideal place to meet various people from different areas of\nexpertise — media, marketing, law, vendors, suppliers, influencers, and, of\ncourse, crypto fans. Such a varied crowd of people is sure to have a lot of\ndifferent feedback about the Open Marketplace, and we are really excited to see\nthe reaction of these people when faced with a modern blockchain product, on\nmainnet.\n\nHaving a good chunk of the team at Consensus will also be ideal to meet people,\ncraft new relationships, and grow the amount of interest for the Particl\necosystem.\n\nMeet the Team\nThe Particl team is going to be 10 member/representative strong going into these\nconferences.\n\n * Juha (Ludx) — Lead Open Marketplace Developer\n * Gerlof van Ek (Crz) — Lead Designer & Branding, UI/UX, Developer\n * Paul Schmitzer (Litebit) — Project Marketing & Strategy\n * Imran (Imyb) — Commercial & Partner Strategy\n * Cryptoguard — Communications & Strategy\n * Gloria (Katelady) — Communications & Strategy\n * Joe Fisher — eCommerce Strategy (Particl Advisor)\n * Lina Seiche — Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist\n * Desi-Rae Campbell (Cryptoramble) — Education & Awareness\n * Joskye — Education & Awareness\n\nCome to our booth at either MCC or Consensus and have a chat with us. We’ll be\ngiving out PART paper wallets, shirts/hoodies, webcam covers, stickers, pins,\nand, most importantly, you’ll be able to test the Particl Open Marketplace live\non mainnet for the first time ever!\n\nIn the meantime, our other developers are hard at work, as per usual, preparing\nthe final build of the Open Marketplace so that it can be publicly released on\nmainnet.\n\nThe Open Marketplace — 2 Great Years of Development\nThe Open Marketplace is quite something to see. It is a complex combination of\npeer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy\nprotocols. It’s also never been attempted before, most of the development toward\nthe marketplace being true pioneering work. It supports a decentralized and\nprivate cryptocurrency, an entirely decentralized escrow mechanism,\ndecentralized file hosting, metadata leak prevention, and etc.\n\nTo see all of the components and features of the Open Marketplace, read our\nPrivacy in eCommerce blog post by following this link: \nhttps://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155\n\nIt has been under heavy and constant development for nearly two years. Almost\nexactly one year ago, Particl released its first proof-of-concept on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, although with a much more basic version of what it has now become. At the\ntime, a simple buy and sell flow was available, without moderation tools,\nwithout proposals, and without a user interface that’s as stable and\nuser-friendly as it is today.\n\nAll this time, throughout the cold crypto winter, the Particl team has been \nhard\nat work [https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9] to\ndeliver its long-anticipated Open Marketplace on mainnet. This much is evidenced\nnot only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on Github\n[http://github.com/particl] but by the very noticeable progress being made on\nthe Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl\nproject has found itself being ranked high in almost all development-related\nrankings of blockchain projects\n[https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9].\n\nAnd here we are, in New York City, presenting the Particl Open Marketplace live\non the main network for the first time ever!\n\nWhat’s next?\nAfter 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is\nnearly over ?\n\nStarting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain,\nParticl created a first:\n\n→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is\nthought of with maximum privacy and security in mind. Everything on Particl is\nprivate, from its untraceable currency to its marketplace, without forgetting\nits proposal, escrow, messaging, file hosting systems, and more.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning, a lot will come after the release of the Open\nMarketplace on mainnet:\n\n * Advanced Open Marketplace features: secure messaging, privacy transactions,\n   inventory management, in-client package tracking, review system, fiat price\n   pegging, and etc.\n * “Marketplace Bubbles” : your own private market on the particl network!\n * CT Bulletproofs, while still being tested on the test network, will improve\n   drastically the size of privacy transactions for any trades of the network.\n   Don’t forget that Particl uses RingCT technology (on testnet), a first on the\n   Bitcoin codebase!\n * Particl Lightning Network (our first testnet transaction just happened a few\n   days ago\n   [https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n   ) and Atomic Swap, so that anyone can change its Bitcoins, Litecoins,\n   Moneros, and more on the marketplace to buy anything in the blink of an eye!\n * Developer SDK so that anyone can easily build their own decentralized\n   applications on the Particl network.\n\nWe are excited to show what true privacy in eCommerce looks like this week in\nNew York, both at MCC and Consensus conference. Although we may be extremely\nbusy during that time, we will not forget to report everything that happens here\nso that you can live these events with us. If you are there, do not hesitate to\npass at our booth to test the marketplace and get some Particl or Bitcoin\nbranded goodies.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-gZG9HtTiXDgtDcLDGYpbgQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

It is a complex combination of peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies mixed in with various privacy protocols.

This much is evidenced not only by looking at the gigantic amount of work being put on <a href=\"http://github.com/particl\">Github</a> but by the very noticeable progress being made on the Open Marketplace itself. This is why, during this whole time, the Particl project has found itself being <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-12-part-2-2a35b005cb45#6dc9\"><strong>ranked high in almost all development-related rankings of blockchain projects</strong></a>.</p><p>And here we are, in New York City, presenting the <strong>Particl Open Marketplace live on the main network for the first time ever</strong>!</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Toward-the-Particl-Open-Marketplace/1-rxsJBXQxnvGWIqJb9-_k-A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>After 2 years of development, the team is really happy to say that the wait is nearly over ?</p><p>Starting from the idea of a decentralized marketplace running on the blockchain, Particl created a first:</p><p>→ an Open Marketplace, always live and decentralized, where everything is thought of with maximum privacy and security in mind.

With this, the Awareness Campaign is now resumed\n[https://friends.particl.community], with sign up payouts disabled, so that you\ncan continue earning staking shares by referring your friends to Particl. When\nyou reach 12 points, you will earn your first staking share. Each additional\npoint will reward you with a staking share.\n\nFor more details, read our latest blog post on the Awareness Campaign by\nfollowing this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-awareness-campaign-update-d94347324121\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn May 1st, we launched the first ever ambassador campaign: the Particl\nAwareness Campaign\n[https://particl.news/particl-ambassador-initiative-70dedea49eef]. The Awareness\nCampaign’s mission is to acquire new users and kick-start the Particl economy,\nplain and simple. More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nThis campaign will run until mid-July and give you the opportunity to earn\npoints that can be redeemed against PART prizes and even lifetime staking\nshares. All you need to do to start earning points it to let your friends know\nabout Particl and get them to sign up with us!\n\nRules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community\n * Sign up with your email\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\n> Note: Signing up with us will earn you 1 point. Each friend you get to sign up\nwith us will earn you 1 additional point.\nPrize\n * 1 lifetime staking share per friend that signs up (12+ points required)\n\nBecause the payouts cap has been reached in just under 16 hours, sign up payouts\nare now complete and disabled. But don’t worry, you can still earn PART by\naccumulating staking shares. All you need to do is get more than 10 of your\nfriends to sign up with us!\n\nAfter getting 10 of your friends to sign up with Particl, each additional one\nwill reward you with 1 lifetime share of the revenue made by the Ambassador\nStaking Pool [https://stake.particl.community/].\n\nTo see the first staking share payment round of the campaign, follow this link: \nhttps://explorer.particl.io/block/e559921895d05a53025dcb84f61ea42fd0362a786d3e848e640015755ba9f0d4\n\nHow to Claim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, all you need to do is send us, by email, a private address.\nDon’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy to acquire. Simply follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Download Particl Desktop\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1] (mainnet)\n * Create a new account (make sure to backup your seed somewhere safe!)\n * Go to the RECEIVE tab located in the sidebar on the left\n * Click on the Private Address tab located at the top of the RECEIVE page\n * Click on the green Copy Address button to copy it to your clipboard\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo learn everything there is to know about this campaign, visit our blog post by\nfollowing the link below.\n\nAnnouncement: Particl Awareness Campaign\n[https://particl.news/announcement-particl-awareness-campaign-464baa8477b5]\nYou and your friends are going to love using Particl!

Thank you for\nparticipating, and please join https://t.me/particlawareness for any questions\nyou may have.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou and your friends are going to love using Particl!\n\nRecently, we introduced Community Contract Pools, a decentralized and\ncommunity-led program designed to fund various initiatives to raise awareness.\nWe’ve also announced that we’re kick-starting this new ‘pool economy’ by\ncreating an awareness campaign to acquire users before the imminent launch of\nour decentralized marketplace. This will be the first-ever initiative to be\nbacked by a Community Contract Pool!\n\nNow for all the nitty gritty details! We believe we’ve designed the best and\nmost innovative campaign to gain traction on our marketplace and get it started\non the right foot.\n\nEarn $PART Coins Just for Signing Up!\nGrab the products you’re looking for and pay for them with crypto!The Awareness\nCampaign’s mission is to acquire new users and kick-start the Particl economy,\nplain and simple. More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nA provably effective technique to acquire new users in the startup world is the\ntraditional referral system — get a friend to try the platform, and get some\nbenefits in return. We all know the very popular Dropbox referral model that, in\nexchange for referring friends, gives you free additional storage capacity on\nyour account.\n\nEarn More by Getting Your Friends to Sign Up!\nThe first Awareness Campaign is indeed a referral program, and it’s a damn good\none! It leverages Community Contract Pools to make it very appealing to\nparticipate in, as you’ll see. The rules are super simple.\n\nAwareness Campaign Rules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community/\n * Register with your email to start participating in the campaign\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n\nPrizes\nGetting friends to use Particl is easy! Each friend you get to sign up nets you\n1 point and points earn you prizes paid in $PART.\n\n * Get $5 worth of $PART for signing up\n * Get $10 worth of $PART when 5 of your friends sign up\n * Get $20 worth of $PART when 10 of your friends sign up\n * Get 1 lifetime staking share per additional friend that signs up (10+)\n\nHow to Claim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, all you need to do is send us, by email, a private address.\nDon’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy to acquire. Simply follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Download Particl Desktop [https://particl.io/downloads/] (mainnet)\n * Create a new account (make sure to backup your seed somewhere safe!)\n * Go to the RECEIVE tab located in the sidebar on the left\n * Click on the Private Address tab located at the top of the RECEIVE page\n * Click on the green Copy Address button to copy it to your clipboard\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\nHow to get your Particl private address and claim your rewards> Note: Payouts will exclusively be made using Confidential Transactions and\nrequire that you send us a private address. That means regular addresses, such\nas those used by exchanges, won’t work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLifetime Staking Shares as Reward\nIn fact, participants who successfully get more than 10 of their friends to use\nParticl will earn lifetime shares of the Ambassador Community Contract Pool\n[https://stake.particl.community/]’s staking revenue.\n\nYes, you’ve heard that right!\n\nIf you teach 10 of your friends about the biggest revolution eCommerce has ever\nseen and get them to sign-up, you can start earning a steady income from this\npool for life!\n\nAs mentioned above, each friend you get to use Particl gives you one point. 10\npoints get you $20 worth of PART. But what if you go above and beyond and get\n25, 100, or even 1,000 people to use Particl!\n\nThat’s where it gets interesting…\n\nIn fact, once you reach 12 points, you’ll earn yourself a single share of the\nstaking revenue made by the Ambassador Community Contract Pool. Then, for each\nadditional friend you refer, you’ll get an additional share. Simply put, you get\n(X-11) shares for every friend you get to use Particl.\n\nFor example, if you get 34 (X) people to register their email to the campaign\nand use Particl, you’ll get 24 shares (X-10). If you refer 8 (X) friends, then\nyou’ll get 0 shares, but you’ll still earn $10 worth of PART since you\nsuccessfully got more than 5 of your friends to sign up.\n\nTo learn more about staking shares and the Ambassador Pool, read our Ambassador\nPool FAQ on Particl Wiki by following the link below.\n\nfaq_ambassador * Particl Project Wiki [https://particl.wiki/faq_ambassador]\nThe Ambassador Pool is the first-ever Community Contract Pool to support an\ninitiative.

Then, you’ll get\na custom link that you can send to your friends so they, also, can participate\nin this campaign and discover Particl at the same time.\n\nEach friend you refer to the platform earns you a point. You can earn $10 worth\nof PART if you get 5 friends to use Particl, and $20 worth of PART for 10\nfriends.\n\nOnce you reach 11 points, you’ll start earning lifetime shares of the staking\nrevenue made by the Ambassador Community Contract Pool.\n\nEasy, right? It doesn’t get more complicated than that!\n\nThe Fine Prints\n * The contest will run until the 16th of July, 2019.\n * To claim your prize, you need to send us a private address from the same\n   email you used to register to the campaign. Sending a private address\n   requires Particl Desktop and is not possible to do from Particl’s mobile\n   application.\n * Payouts will be executed for the first time on the 23rd of May 2019, and will\n   then be payed out every 2 weeks after that point.\n * Staking rewards, proportionally to how many shares you own, will be paid for\n   the first time on the 23rd of May 2019, and will then be paid out every 2\n   weeks after that point. Learn more about what are staking rewards here: \n   https://particl.wiki/faq_ambassador\n * The campaign has a hidden payout cap. If the amount of payouts executed\n   exceeds this cap, payouts will be disabled. After that point, it will only be\n   possible to earn staking shares. This is a limited time offer, payouts will\n   be paid on a first arrived, first served basis!\n * Shares are tracked internally by the team, but you can monitor them by\n   checking out the leaderboard available at this link: \n   https://particl.news/particl-awareness-campaign-leaderboard-649494d8177a\n * Points displayed on the campaign’s page and on the leaderboard may differ.\n   Only points displayed on the leaderboard are valid.\n\nHow Will Your Data be Used\n * We will not share your email or data with any party.\n * Your email will exclusively be used to send out newsletters and promotional\n   content.

The\nstaking rewards they collect are used to fund any initiative started by the\ncommunity, effectively bootstrapping the Particl economy and allowing it to be\nself-sufficient.\n\nThese pools are different from regular cold staking pools in that they can\ncharge up to 100% fees. This means stakers do not receive any staking reward\nfrom the number of coins being staked in this type of pool, but that doesn’t\nmean they don’t receive anything in return.\n\nFor more information about Community Contract Pools, please read our previous\narticle on the subject by clicking the box below.\n\nCommunity Contract Pools\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]\nIf you've been around the community for some time, then you probably know that\nthere have always been some discussions…\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGetting Started\nCommunity Contract Pools open up a lot of possibilities to expand and further\ndecentralize the Particl ecosystem. To get the ball rolling, we’re revealing\ntoday the first initiative to be supported by a Community Contract Pool: the \nAmbassador Initiative.\n\nWord of mouth is extremely important for any idea to gain traction in the\ncollective awareness of society. Our goal is to increase the velocity of the\nconversation surrounding the highly anticipated launch of the Particl\nMarketplace. And, this idea holds even more weight with us releasing a\nmarketplace because they are global platforms that purely rely on user activity\nto thrive.\n\nThis is the reason why we are announcing today the Particl Ambassador\nInitiative, an ambassador group actively advocating for Particl within their own\nsocial circles. This group will be directly supported by the first ever\nCommunity Contract Pool. The pool will award its ambassadors with staking\nrewards proportionally to their net performance in driving new people on the\nParticl platform.\n\nThe Ambassador Initiative\nThe Ambassador Initiative is a group of individuals that are passionate about\nParticl and are advocating for it within their own social circles. Ambassadors\nwill have the opportunity to earn lifetime shares of the pool’s staking revenue \nby participating in various campaigns.\n\nThe Mission\nThe ambassadors’ mission is simple: get people to sign-up and use the Particl\nplatform. It directly addresses the number one requirement for marketplaces to\ngain traction — getting as many active users as possible.\n\nIn order to achieve its mission, ambassadors will have the opportunity to\nparticipate in various campaigns, each of them having the objective to drive new\nusers to Particl.\n\nAmbassador Campaigns\nEvery once in a while, campaigns will become available for ambassadors. These\ncampaigns may be different from one to another, but their purpose will always be\nto fulfill the ambassadors’ mission of driving new users to Particl.\n\nCampaigns will usually last for several days or weeks and have their own rules\nand requirements. They will award participants with points which count as \nlifetime shares of the pool’s staking revenue.\n\nEarn PART\nBeing a Particl ambassador is, simply put, setting the income wheels in motion\nand keeping it in auto-pilot. In fact, when you participate in campaigns, you\nearn a percentage of the Community Contract Pool’s staking revenue by\naccumulating shares.\n\nYour performance within the lifespan of a campaign earns you more share. The\nnumber of shares you earn at the end of a challenge is directly proportional to\nyour performance.\n\nIt’s for Life!\n> Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed\nhim for a lifetime\nWhat’s really great about earning shares from the ambassador’s pool is that they\nare valid for a lifetime. This means that, once you earn a share, you keep it\nfor life. Imagine receiving a couple of staking rewards today, and still earn\nsome more a few years into the future!\n\nOn top of the lifetime characteristic of these shares, they are also cumulative.\nThat means you can get as many as you can, over as many campaigns as you want to\nparticipate in. There is no cap to how many shares you can accumulate as well as\nno penalty for not participating in campaigns. If there’s a campaign you can’t\nor don’t want to participate in, you won’t be penalized by losing shares you\nearned in the past.\n\nHow to Qualify as an Ambassador\nAnyone can qualify to become an ambassador. All you need to do is participate in\nambassador campaigns and start earning shares. Note that, most of the time,\nchallenges will require a minimum of scored points in order to qualify for the\npool’s reward program.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupport Particl Ambassadors Today\nSupporting Particl ambassadors with a portion of your staking rewards is like\nmaking a sort of “staking investment” in the Particl ecosystem. It incentivizes\nand encourages ambassadors to go out there, help grow Particl’s userbase, and be\nfairly compensated for their valuable time.\n\nGrowing the number of users directly adds value to the network because it\nincreases the number of buyers, sellers, available products on the marketplace,\nand etc. It also dramatically increases the velocity of the Particl economy by\nputting more staking rewards in circulation, an issue often cited when referring\nto Proof-of-Stake networks. Additionally, more users transacting on the network\nmeans stronger privacy for everyone.\n\nSimply put, the added value an effective and motivated core of ambassadors can\nprovide to the network far exceeds what it costs to get it properly funded, \nespecially when it’s getting funded with staking rewards. It also puts the\nnetwork’s inflation to good use by having it directly contribute to its own\nbenefit.\n\nEven though the first ambassador campaign will only be announced in a few days,\nyou can still start supporting Particl ambassadors today by connecting a wallet\nto the Community Contract Pool at https://stake.particl.community.\n\nFor a complete step-by-step tutorial on how to connect to a Community Contract\nPool, visit the Wiki page here: https://particl.wiki/communitycontractpools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Pool’s Parameters\n * Website: https://stake.particl.community\n * Operator: https://particl.community\n * Fee: 100%\n * Percentage of fees paid to ambassadors: 100%\n * Payout frequency: Every 2 weeks\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst Ambassador Campaign\nThe first ambassador campaign will be announced in a few days.

The Open Marketplace\nis a great example of this, but it’s far from being the only aspect contributing\nto the Particl global economy. Cold staking pools are also a key player in\nmaking sure anyone can contribute to the network and earn staking rewards in\nexchange for securing the network.\n\nWhile they’ve been mostly used by small holders to easily pool their funds\ntogether and earn staking rewards more frequently, the possibilities enabled by\nthe cold staking model extend much further than that. Indeed, Community Contract\nPools, a new form of cold staking pool, are at the core of an innovative\neconomic model through decentralized funding. We’d like to introduce this new\nconcept today.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * Decentralized & Crowd-Sourced Funding Model\n * What’s a Community Contract Pool?\n * How Do I Use Them?\n * What Can a Community Contract Pool Support?\n * Non-Binding Community Contracts\n * Start a Community Contract Pool of Your Own\n * First Community Contract Pool Goes Live This Week\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecentralized & Crowd-Sourced Funding Model\nIf you’ve been around the community for some time, then you probably know that\nthere have always been some discussions about setting up some sort of passive\nfunding mechanism through Particl Proof-of-Stake. After all, Proof-of-Stake\nprotocols are ripe for this — they reward you with coin rewards in exchange for\nsecuring the network. And, let’s be honest here, “securing the network” is a\npretty laidback process that doesn’t actually involve much manual labor. You\njust set up cold staking (or connect to a pool in less than 30 seconds\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUvwj-ejng4&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfwl7BxnruR84agicV1SyrYF&index=5]\n), sit back, and watch your staking rewards pouring in, nicely growing that\nwallet of yours.\n\nThis is precisely what makes passive funding so easy to do. Because donating\nstaking rewards doesn’t actually require you to spend a portion of your initial\ncapital, it makes altruism much easier, especially when it directly benefits the\nnetwork that’s making that form of passive income possible.\n\nOn top of that, airdrops, giveaways, and free stuff, in general, have proven to\nbe effective ways to grow crypto-based communities. With the huge numbers of\nblockchain projects, though, attracting users now requires projects to be as\ncreative as they possibly can. Luckily for Particl, it possesses some pretty\ncool and innovative tech that can be used, along with a bit of creativity, to\ncreate some pretty exciting incentive programs and passive donation concepts.\n\nSupporting a Community Contract Pool is not just a donation, it is an investment\nyou’re making into the Particl ecosystem to bootstrap its economy.\n\nWhat’s a Community Contract Pool?\nA “Community Contract Pool” is a brand new way to use cold staking pools for\nreasons other than just providing an easy and convenient cold staking option.\nThis type of pool charges users with a significant fee (usually 100%) fee and is\nmeant to be used in combination with multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]. Its\npurpose is to fund initiatives, as established by the pool’s operator, using\npassive community donations in the form of staking rewards.\n\nCommunity Contract Pools are the easiest way to passively crowdfund initiatives\nin order to spark growth within the Particl ecosystem. They are also a great\nshowcase of how the currently available Particl tech can foster a brand new, 2.0\ntype of global economy that simply wasn’t possible before.\n\nHow Do They Work?\nAs mentioned above, Community Contract Pools are meant to be used in combination\nwith multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]. The reason\nbehind this is pretty simple: stakers likely won’t be looking into giving ALL of\ntheir staking rewards away. No, instead, they’re more likely to be willing to\ndonate only a portion of them. That’s where multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076] come into\nplay.\n\nMulti-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076] allow you\nto easily manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance. It\nis as if you had many wallets opened up at the same time. The key here is that\neach of these wallets can be set up with a different cold staking key. This\nmeans you can have multiple wallets, on the same Particl Desktop instance, each\nstaking using different staking nodes or pools.\n\nAs an example, let’s say that you would like to fund a certain initiative with\n10% of your staking rewards. All you would need to do is pretty simple and it\ncan be done under a minute or two:\n\n * Create a new wallet on Particl Desktop\n * Send 10% of your coins to this new wallet\n * Visit the website of the Community Contract Pool you want to support\n * Locate and copy its public key\n * Connect your newly created wallet by entering the public key in the cold\n   staking widget\n * Zap your funds to start donating your staking rewards immediately\n\nOnce that’s all said and one, 10% of all your staking rewards will now be\nredirected towards the initiative proposed by the Community Contract Pool. Yes,\nyou would be making 10% less in staking revenues, but you’d be fueling up an\ninitiative that can contribute to adding more value to the Particl ecosystem\nthrough an active expansion plan that will benefit you and the entire community.\n\nWhat Can a Community Contract Pool Support?\nSo what are those special pools meant to support? Well, anything really. As its\nname implies, Community Contract Pools can be created by anyone in the\ncommunity, just like any other regular cold staking pool. The operator can\ndecide to support any initiative, cause, or project…and that’s where the \ncreativity side of things comes in handy.\n\nIn fact, Community Contract Pool can propose any initiative:\n\n * A marketing or social media campaign\n * A targeted airdrop to acquire new users\n * A Dapp development fund to support community developers\n * Donations to a privacy-focused organization (i.e. Tor Project, EFF, and etc)\n * An exchange listing\n * A vendor onboarding program\n * Pay for media services and articles\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Go WILD!\n\nNon-Binding Community Contracts\nWhen staking your funds in a Community Contract Pool, you are essentially\nentering a non-binding contract with the pool operator. In exchange for your\nstaking weight, the operator is meant to fulfill the mission for which the pool\nwas created.\n\nHow many funding a Community Contract Pool receives, however, is entirely up to\nthe stakers. Some initiatives might get more popular than others, and the\ndecentralized part of this system gives full freedom of choice to anyone looking\ninto actively contributing with their staking.\n\nStakers can easily and quickly exit the pool, without penalty, at any time and\nfor any reason. Community Contract Pools are, with this in mind, a non-binding\ncontract between the staker and the pool operator.\n\n> Note: Community Contract Pools should ideally be operated by experienced and\ntrusted community members. Pool operators should state the pool’s purpose,\nmission, and program. It should stick to it. As a counterparty, they should be\ntransparent and effective in managing the funds. Particl is not responsible for\nany misbehavior from any pool operated by the community. Stakers should always\ndo their due diligence before donating their staking rewards to a pool operator.\nStart a Community Contract Pool of Your Own\nStarting a Community Contract Pool is no different than starting a regular cold\nstaking pool. The only difference is the fee — up to 100% instead of the regular\n~2.5%. To get all the details on how to start your own cold staking pool, please\nrefer to this tutorial:\n\ntecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/vps_setup_example.txt]\nPooled coldstaking demo.

The\ngreater the number of Community Contract Pools, the more initiatives can get\nfunded!\n\nFirst Community Contract Pool Goes Live This Week\nTo kickstart this new concept, we will announce this week the first Community\nContract Pool and reveal its purpose. The campaign it supports will help drive\nattention to the project and its Open Marketplace by incentivizing influencers\nto promote and talk about it.

The key here is that each of these wallets can be set up with a different cold staking key. This means you can have multiple wallets, on the same Particl Desktop instance, each staking using different staking nodes or pools.</p><p><strong>As an example, let’s say that you would like to fund a certain initiative with 10% of your staking rewards.</strong> All you would need to do is pretty simple and it can be done under a minute or two:</p><ul><li>Create a new wallet on Particl Desktop</li><li>Send 10% of your coins to this new wallet</li><li>Visit the website of the Community Contract Pool you want to support</li><li>Locate and copy its public key</li><li>Connect your newly created wallet by entering the public key in the cold staking widget</li><li>Zap your funds to start donating your staking rewards immediately</li></ul><p>Once that’s all said and one, 10% of all your staking rewards will now be redirected towards the initiative proposed by the Community Contract Pool.

Some initiatives might get more popular than others, and the decentralized part of this system gives full freedom of choice to anyone looking into actively contributing with their staking.</p><p>Stakers can easily and quickly exit the pool, without penalty, at any time and for any reason. Community Contract Pools are, with this in mind, a non-binding contract between the staker and the pool operator.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>Community Contract Pools should ideally be operated by experienced and trusted community members.

Today, we’d\nlike to dive deeper into the upcoming multi-wallet capabilities of Particl\nDesktop.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Multi-Wallets?\nMulti-Wallets, as they were displayed on previous test builds (subject\nto change)Multi-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been\navailable on Particl-Qt ever since Particl forked to codebase version 0.15. We\nare, however, now bringing this important feature onto our most popular client:\nParticl Desktop.\n\nWhat if you could manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop\ninstance? What if you could do it without breaking a sweat? This is exactly what\nthis multi-wallet feature allows you to do! It enables the ability to securely\nmanage multiple wallets from a single Particl Desktop instance without requiring\nyou to restart the wallet or mess with the wallet files (wallet.dat).\n\nWhen using multi-wallets, your identity, transaction history, and any other\nParticl-related data (i.e. listings, contact information, messages, etc) are\nperfectly isolated from the other wallets hosted on your Particl Desktop. This\nmakes it impossible for this information to leak into another wallet.\n\nMulti-wallets serve multiple purposes within the Particl ecosystem and will be\nan important feature moving forward. As time goes by, and as the Particl\ninfrastructure expands, they will become truly indispensable.\n\nSecurity & Privacy\nMulti-wallets are first and foremost a security and privacy feature. The reason\nwhy is that all the data from a wallet (i.e. transaction details, listings,\ncontact information, messages, votes, listing flags, etc) is perfectly isolated\nfrom other wallets installed on the same Particl Desktop. All multi-wallets are\nalso encrypted independently and have their own password.\n\nIn computer security, this ability can be compared pretty closely to the \nsecurity by isolation model. This model proposes that one of the best and most\neffective ways to secure data from multiple environments is by isolating them\nfrom each other. Particl Desktop achieves similar results by completely\nisolating the wallet files (wallet.dat) from each other.\n\nIn other words, if you are managing two (or more) different wallets from the\nsame Particl Desktop instance, it is as if you were managing them from different\ncomputers entirely. Wallet data cannot leak out into another wallet, just like\ndata from a computer cannot leak out into another computer by itself.\n\n> Note: This doesn’t mean your data is safe if your computer gets hacked into.\nWhile the wallet files themselves are isolated on the Particl Desktop client,\nthey are not isolated inside your computer itself. They are still stored in the\nsame place in your Particl configuration folder. The only way to secure your\nfunds against hackers that would breach into your computer is to store them on a\nhardware device like the Ledger Nano S (1 [https://particl.wiki/ledger], 2\n[https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking], 3\n[https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac]\n).\nSecurity — Eliminating Human Errors\nOf course, managing multiple wallets has always been kind of possible to do, but\nit’s definitely never been convenient. In fact, if you want to switch wallets on\nParticl Desktop without using multi-wallets, you can actually go through a\npainful manual routine that goes as follow:\n\n * Create a folder containing all of your wallet files (named differently)\n * Shut Particl Desktop down\n * Navigate to your Particl configuration folder\n * Backup your wallet.dat file and move it to the wallet folder you just created\n * Give it a different name (i.e. wallet_spending.dat)\n * In your wallet folder, pick the wallet file of the wallet you want to switch\n   to\n * Move it into your Particl configuration folder\n * Rename it to wallet.dat\n * Start Particl Desktop\n * Rinse and repeat every time you want to switch wallet\n\nAlmost cringeworthy, right? Not only is this very tedious set of steps a serious\nobstacle to regularly using multiple wallets, but it’s also a bit of a security\nrisk. That’s because, on a long enough timeline, we are all guaranteed to make\nmistakes. Indeed, research suggests that the great majority of information\nleaks\nand incidents are due to human errors\n[https://iapp.org/news/a/data-indicates-human-error-prevailing-cause-of-breaches-incidents/]\n, not hacks or malicious breaches.\n\nImage Source: iapp.org> “There is a tendency to assume incidents exposing\nsensitive, regulated data occur as a result of an organization being “under\nattack.” Seasoned privacy professionals, however, know that in reality, the\nmajority of incidents are inadvertent and unintentional, and can be classified\nas human error.” —Mahmood Sher-Jan\n[https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlQM8AAN/]\nWho’s to say you won’t ever forget to back a wallet file up before manually\nswitching? That you won’t overwrite a file by mistake? With multi-wallets, you\ndon’t need to worry about these human errors anymore. This feature makes\nswitching between wallets safe, quick, and easy.\n\nPrivacy — Address Association Prevention\nYou probably know by now that you shouldn’t reuse deposit addresses for privacy\nreasons. In fact, anyone that knows an address of yours can look it up on a\nblock explorer and analyze the transactions you’ve made with it in the past.\nWhat’s worse is that, not only can anyone look up your address on the\nblockchain, they can also do the same to all of the addresses associated,\ndirectly or indirectly, with it. To keep it simple, an address is “associated”\nwith another address if it has received or sent payments to it.\n\nImage Source: @iang (Steemit.com)This is why using new deposit addresses when\naccepting payments is the recommended behavior for the great majority of\ncryptocurrencies. To increase the number of users doing just that, more and more\ncrypto wallets have started generating brand new addresses by default when\nrequesting payments. This type of wallet is called a Hierarchical Deterministic\n(HD) wallet\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp]\n. It is what Particl uses for its wallet clients.\n\nThere are, however, other privacy-related issues that still stand unresolved.\nEven when receiving payments with new addresses, you can still easily reveal\nyour other ones. That’s because unused addresses get associated with any other\naddress to which it sends a payment to. It also gets associated with any address\nfurther down the transactional chain, meaning “associated addresses of\nassociated addresses”.\n\nIn other words, if someone sends you a payment to an unused address, and then\nafter some time you send that payment to your main stash, you effectively reveal\nyour main stash information (number of coins, who you’ve made and received\npayments to, who they’ve sent and received payments to as well, and etc) to the\nperson that paid you. Of course, blockchain analysis can reveal public addresses\nthat receive and send payments. It can’t, however, tell ‘who’ exactly the\naddresses belong to unless it is already known that an associated address\nbelongs to a certain entity (i.e. by sending funds to an exchange).\n\nWould you want a stranger to know how much you own? Would you want an exchange\nto know everything you do with your personal coins not stored on their platform?\nWould you want any person, organization, or company associated with blockchain\ndata analysis firms\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com] \nto be able to mine all of your data?\n\n> Last week, cryptocurrency industry giant Coinbase sparked outrage when it \nannounced\n[https://blog.coinbase.com/welcoming-neutrino-to-coinbase-b3f56171850d] that it\nhad purchased a small startup called Neutrino.Normally, such an acquisition\nwouldn’t make many waves, but Neutrino isn’t your average startup. The company\nwas founded by three former employees of Hacking Team\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=hacking+team+vice&oq=hacking+team+vice&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.4680j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8]\n, a controversial Italian surveillance vendor that was caught several times \nselling spyware to governments\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nzeg5x/here-are-all-the-sketchy-government-agencies-buying-hacking-teams-spy-tech] \nwith dubious human rights records, such as Ethiopia\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypwk4j/ethiopia-allegedly-used-spyware-against-us-based-journalists-again]\n, Saudi Arabia\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xvzyp/hacking-team-investor-saudi-arabia]\n, and Sudan. —Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/contributor/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai]\n\nWith these technologies becoming increasingly effective AND accessible, we need\nmore diverse and solid solutions to protect our digital privacy.\n\nPrivacy — Stop Mixing UTXOs\nWhat’s more, there is another privacy concern when making transactions after\nyour received payments. Let’s say you accept two 10 PART payments (20 PART\ntotal, deposited on two different unused addresses). Then, for some reason, you\nneed to make a payment worth 15 PART AFTER receiving your two 10 PART payments.\nEven though both payments were received on different addresses, making a 15 PART\npayment would use outputs from both addresses, effectively linking them\ntogether. That’s because these addresses have less than 15 PART, so coins from\nboth addresses need to be used.\n\nThis would effectively link both addresses since the party you send the payment\nto will see the funds coming from two different addresses. This is a big privacy\nissue (and the reason why the Coin Control feature of Particl-Qt is so\npowerful)!\n\nwtokensw.com> Note: In the example above, TX 6 used outputs from both TX 4 and TX5 (two\ndifferent addresses) to fund its inputs. Although both TX 4 and TX 5 were\nalready linked together because of TX 0 and TX 2, one of the output used to send\nfunds to TX 6 could have also come from a fictive TX 7 — an output not\npreviously associated with any part of that chain of transactions. This would\nlink TX 7 and TX 6 together, as well as all outputs and inputs directly or\nindirectly associated with TX 7 and TX 6.\nBy using multi-wallets, you can create new wallets every time you want to accept\npayments or use different wallets per types or categories of transactions (i.e.\na wallet to receive marketplace payments, another to receive staking rewards,\nanother to deposit and withdraw coins from exchanges, and etc).This method of\nsecuring your privacy by isolating the wallets from each other mix really well\nwith the privacy protocols of the PART coin. In fact, you can achieve much\nstronger privacy by combining RingCT/CT transactions to a solid wallet isolation\nstrategy.\n\nConvenience — How Do I Change Wallets?\nAs with everything Particl Desktop, convenience and ease-of-use is a big focus,\nbut there are no compromises made on the security end of things. Multi-wallets\nare directly in line with this approach and make switching between different\nwallets as easy as it can possibly be. Remember the tedious 9-step process for\nswitching wallets mentioned above? It’s been reduced to only one easy step:\n\n * Click on the tab of the wallet you want to use\n\nThat’s right, as simple as clicking a button! Ain’t that security made easy? No\nneed to rename or even mess with wallet.dat files, no need to restart Particl\nDesktop every time you want to switch wallets, and most importantly, no need to\npass on benefiting from security through isolation because the process of doing\nso is too annoying! ?\n\nCold Staking & Multi-Wallets — A Match Made in Heaven\nThis new multi-wallet feature is certainly a great security and privacy add-on\nto Particl Desktop, but its usefulness doesn’t stop there! In fact, each wallet\nhosted under the same Particl Desktop instance can be linked to its own cold\nstaking key. That means you can have multiple wallets staking from different\nsources, with different addresses to receive (or send) your staking rewards.\n\nLet’s say you have three different wallets and want to set your staking setup\nwith failsafe capabilities. You could then create three cold staking node, and\nlink each of them to a different wallet. If one node goes down, then only a part\nof your coins stop staking, not all of them. Even better, you could set up a\nnode on an RPi, one on a VPS, and use the public key of a cold staking pool as\nyour third node. This way, you would be staking from three different cold\nstaking nodes hosted under three very different environments. This adds a bit of\nredundancy to your staking setup and is a failsafe measure in case an issue\narises with one of the nodes.\n\nPerhaps even more interesting, though, is the ability to better manage staking\nrewards. With the possibility to stake on multiple nodes within the same Particl\nDesktop instance, multi-wallets enable a whole range of new possibilities. What\nif you don’t want to keep all your staking rewards in PART? What if you only\nwant to keep 50%, have 25% sent to an address used for trading and the other 25%\nas donations? What if you wanted to set multiple addresses up, each having its\nown purpose (i.e. spending, saving, trading, vacations, joint address with a\nloved one, purchases on the marketplace, health fund, and etc).\n\nDoing exactly this has always been possible, of course. All you needed to do was\nto set up multiple wallets and cycle through them using the tedious 9-step\nprocess mentioned above. But now, with multi-wallets, it’s going to be as easy,\naccessible, and quick as it’s ever been!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMulti-wallets bring added privacy, security, and convenience to Particl Desktop\nand open a lot of possibilities for almost every type of users.

Today, we’d like to dive deeper into the upcoming multi-wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-are-multi-wallets\">What are Multi-Wallets?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-Qo-jqiEtrW8sAEbyAJNGCg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Multi-Wallets, as they were displayed on previous test builds (subject to change)</figcaption></figure><p>Multi-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been available on Particl-Qt ever since Particl forked to codebase version 0.15. We are, however, now bringing this important feature onto our most popular client: Particl Desktop.</p><p>What if you could manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance? What if you could do it without breaking a sweat? This is exactly what this multi-wallet feature allows you to do! It enables the ability to securely manage multiple wallets from a single Particl Desktop instance without requiring you to restart the wallet or mess with the wallet files (wallet.dat).</p><p>When using multi-wallets, your identity, transaction history, and any other Particl-related data (i.e. listings, contact information, messages, etc) are perfectly isolated from the other wallets hosted on your Particl Desktop. This makes it impossible for this information to leak into another wallet.</p><p>Multi-wallets serve multiple purposes within the Particl ecosystem and will be an important feature moving forward. As time goes by, and as the Particl infrastructure expands, they will become truly indispensable.</p><h2 id=\"security-privacy\">Security &amp; Privacy</h2><p>Multi-wallets are first and foremost a security and privacy feature. The reason why is that all the data from a wallet (i.e. transaction details, listings, contact information, messages, votes, listing flags, etc) is perfectly isolated from other wallets installed on the same Particl Desktop. All multi-wallets are also encrypted independently and have their own password.</p><p>In computer security, this ability can be compared pretty closely to the <em><strong>security by isolation </strong></em>model. This model proposes that one of the best and most effective ways to secure data from multiple environments is by isolating them from each other. Particl Desktop achieves similar results by completely isolating the wallet files (wallet.dat) from each other.</p><p>In other words, <strong>if you are managing two (or more) different wallets from the same Particl Desktop instance, it is as if you were managing them from different computers entirely</strong>. Wallet data cannot leak out into another wallet, just like data from a computer cannot leak out into another computer by itself.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This doesn’t mean your data is safe if your computer gets hacked into. While the wallet files themselves are isolated on the Particl Desktop client, they are not isolated inside your computer itself. They are still stored in the same place in your Particl configuration folder. The only way to secure your funds against hackers that would breach into your computer is to store them on a hardware device like the Ledger Nano S (<a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\"><strong>2</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac\"><strong>3</strong></a>).</blockquote><h3 id=\"security-eliminating-human-errors\">Security — Eliminating Human Errors</h3><p>Of course, managing multiple wallets has always been<em> kind of</em> possible to do, but it’s definitely never been convenient. In fact, if you want to switch wallets on Particl Desktop without using multi-wallets, you can actually go through a painful manual routine that goes as follow:</p><ul><li>Create a folder containing all of your wallet files (named differently)</li><li>Shut Particl Desktop down</li><li>Navigate to your Particl configuration folder</li><li>Backup your wallet.dat file and move it to the wallet folder you just created</li><li>Give it a different name (i.e. wallet_spending.dat)</li><li>In your wallet folder, pick the wallet file of the wallet you want to switch to</li><li>Move it into your Particl configuration folder</li><li>Rename it to wallet.dat</li><li>Start Particl Desktop</li><li>Rinse and repeat every time you want to switch wallet</li></ul><p>Almost cringeworthy, right? Not only is this very tedious set of steps a serious obstacle to regularly using multiple wallets, but it’s also a bit of a security risk. That’s because, on a long enough timeline, we are all guaranteed to make mistakes. Indeed, <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/data-indicates-human-error-prevailing-cause-of-breaches-incidents/\"><strong>research suggests that the great majority of information leaks and incidents are due to human errors</strong></a>, not hacks or malicious breaches.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-evJaI7FtM6TigszkiDFhOA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Image Source: iapp.org</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“There is a tendency to assume incidents exposing sensitive, regulated data occur as a result of an organization being “under attack.” Seasoned privacy professionals, however, know that in reality, the majority of incidents are inadvertent and unintentional, and can be classified as human error.” — <a href=\"https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlQM8AAN/\">Mahmood Sher-Jan</a></blockquote><p>Who’s to say you won’t ever forget to back a wallet file up before manually switching?

In fact, anyone that knows an address of yours can look it up on a block explorer and analyze the transactions you’ve made with it in the past. What’s worse is that, not only can anyone look up your address on the blockchain, they can also do the same to all of the addresses associated, directly or indirectly, with it. To keep it simple, an address is “associated” with another address if it has received or sent payments to it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Multi-Wallets-on-Particl-Desktop/1-6_Hg2rf31nErsKnFK0k4Tw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Image Source: @iang (Steemit.com)</figcaption></figure><p>This is why using new deposit addresses when accepting payments is the recommended behavior for the great majority of cryptocurrencies. To increase the number of users doing just that, more and more crypto wallets have started generating brand new addresses by default when requesting payments. This type of wallet is called a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp\"><strong>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet</strong></a><strong>. </strong>It is what Particl uses for its wallet clients.</p><p>There are, however, other privacy-related issues that still stand unresolved. Even when receiving payments with new addresses, you can still easily reveal your other ones. That’s because unused addresses get associated with any other address to which it sends a payment to. It also gets associated with any address further down the transactional chain, meaning “associated addresses of associated addresses”.</p><p>In other words, if someone sends you a payment to an unused address, and then after some time you send that payment to your main stash, you effectively reveal your main stash information (number of coins, who you’ve made and received payments to, who they’ve sent and received payments to as well, and etc) to the person that paid you. Of course, blockchain analysis can reveal public addresses that receive and send payments. It can’t, however, tell ‘who’ exactly the addresses belong to <strong>unless it is already known that an associated address belongs to a certain entity </strong>(i.e. by sending funds to an exchange).</p><p>Would you want a stranger to know how much you own? Would you want an exchange to know everything you do with your personal coins not stored on their platform? Would you want any person, organization, or <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com\"><strong>company associated with blockchain data analysis firms</strong></a> to be able to mine all of your data?</p><blockquote>Last week, cryptocurrency industry giant Coinbase sparked outrage when it <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/welcoming-neutrino-to-coinbase-b3f56171850d\">announced</a> that it had purchased a small startup called Neutrino.Normally, such an acquisition wouldn’t make many waves, but Neutrino isn’t your average startup.

Multi-wallets are directly in line with this approach and make switching between different wallets as easy as it can possibly be. <strong>Remember the </strong><a href=\"#009d\"><strong>tedious 9-step process for switching wallets</strong></a><strong> mentioned above?

In fact, each wallet hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance can be linked to its own cold staking key. That means you can have multiple wallets staking from different sources, with different addresses to receive (or send) your staking rewards.</p><p>Let’s say you have three different wallets and want to set your staking setup with failsafe capabilities. You could then create three cold staking node, and link each of them to a different wallet. If one node goes down, then only a part of your coins stop staking, not all of them. Even better, you could set up a node on an RPi, one on a VPS, and use the public key of a cold staking pool as your third node. This way, you would be staking from three different cold staking nodes hosted under three very different environments. This adds a bit of redundancy to your staking setup and is a failsafe measure in case an issue arises with one of the nodes.</p><p>Perhaps even more interesting, though, is the ability to better manage staking rewards. With the possibility to stake on multiple nodes within the same Particl Desktop instance, multi-wallets enable a whole range of new possibilities. What if you don’t want to keep all your staking rewards in PART? What if you only want to keep 50%, have 25% sent to an address used for trading and the other 25% as donations? What if you wanted to set multiple addresses up, each having its own purpose (i.e. spending, saving, trading, vacations, joint address with a loved one, purchases on the marketplace, health fund, and etc).</p><p>Doing exactly this has always been possible, of course. All you needed to do was to set up multiple wallets and cycle through them using the <a href=\"#009d\"><strong>tedious 9-step process</strong></a> mentioned above.

This hardfork will port two testnet features onto mainnet: multi-signature\ncold staking and paid SMSG. Because hardforks are a pretty big deal, it is\nimportant for you to prepare your nodes in prevision of this event so that you\nare not left staking on a deprecated chain. Luckily, the whole preparation\nprocess is extremely easy.\n\nDevelopment Update - Planned Hardfork Schedule - Particl News\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n2019.02.16-12:00:00 UTC In 4 days, on the 16th of February, we're going to fork\nParticl's test network (testnet) to…\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Prepare\nThe only thing you need to make sure is that the nodes you are running are\nupdated to Particl Core 0.17.1.3, or, at the very least, Particl Core 0.17.1.2. \nAny version prior to this one will not be compatible with the hardforked chain\nand will therefore make you stake on the wrong chain. This will make all of your\nstaking rewards invalid and any transaction made on that wrong chain will not be\nreflected on the hardforked chain. In other words, you absolutely need to update\nyour node before the hardfork if you wish to use PART post-hardfork.\n\nHere’s how to do it, depending on the client you use.\n\nParticl Desktop | Particl Qt/cli | Partyman | Cold Staking Pool | Particl Copay \n| On Exchange\n\nI. Particl Desktop\nIf you’re using Particl Desktop, then lucky you, because it is the easiest of\nall clients to update. Running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and beyond means your\nwallet will automatically notify you as soon as there’s a new Particl Core\nversion available. All you have to do after getting this notification is close\nyour Particl Desktop wallet and reopen it. Your Particl Core daemon should\nautomatically update upon reopening the client.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, even if you are running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and\nbeyond, it is recommended to manually check if the wallet has properly updated.\nThere shouldn’t be any issue, but you can never be too careful when a hardforks\ncoming.\n\n.Additionally, if you are running a Particl Desktop version older than 1.3.1,\nthen we highly recommend, as always, upgrading to the latest version\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb] as it fixes\nvarious issues, bugs, and contains many improvements.\n\nDownload Particl Desktop 1.3.1: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1\n\nParticl Desktop 1.3.1 Announcement & Changelog: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\n\nII. Particl-Qt & Particl-cli\nIf you’re running either Particl-Qt or Particl-cli, then you will need to\nmanually download and install the latest version of Particl Core. Simply visit\nthe Particl-Core Github release page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/] and download the latest\nversion.\n\nNote: The latest Particl Core version is 0.17.1.3, not 0.17.1.2. However, as\nlong as you run a Particl Core version that is equal or more recent than\n0.17.1.2, you will have no issue with the hardfork. Particl Core 0.17.1.2 is the\nMINIMUM version required for your to follow along with the network’s hardfork.\n\nDownload Particl Core 0.17.1.3: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\n\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree.

Partyman (Cold Staking App)\nIf you are using Partyman to cold stake your funds, then whenever you enter a\ncommand within the app, it should automatically prompt you to install the newest\nversion. In order to properly update your node, you will first need to upgrade\nyour Partyman app, then update your Core. In order to do this, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Go into your Partyman folder (cd /root/partyman)\n * Type the command git pull. This will update the Partyman app.\n * Once done, update Particl Core by typing./partyman update\n * Accept the update by typing y\n * Once updated, restart your Particl Core by typing./partyman restart\n * Accept the restart by typing y\n\nIV. Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are cold staking from a pool, you don’t need to do anything other than\nupdate whatever wallet you use to access your funds. Usually, this would be\nParticl-Qt or Particl Desktop. Refer to the instructions above to properly\nupdate.\n\nIf you are a pool operator, you will need to update both the Particl Core and\nthe packages of your pool. Follow these steps:\n\n * First update your pool’s packages: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_old_install_to_package.txt\n * Then, update your Particl Core: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.txt\n\nV. Particl Copay Wallet\nIf you are using Particl’s mobile application, Particl Copay, then you don’t\nneed to do anything. The nodes Particl Copay connects to will automatically\nupdate in time for the hardfork.\n\nVI. Coins on Exchange\nIf your coins are stored on an exchange, then you don’t need to do anything. The\nexchange will update its nodes in time for the hardfork. Exchanges and other\nthird-parties running Particl nodes have already been made aware of the upcoming\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be equipped to navigate any standard\nissue during or after the hardfork. If you have any question, don’t hesitate to \njoin our Discord [https://discord.gg/YFeXbFZ] server and ask your questions in\nthe #support channel. We’ll be happy to help you out!\n\nIn the meantime, we can’t wait to go through this hardfork and add to Particl’s\nnetwork these two awesome features!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/March-1st-Hardfork---How-to-Prepare/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As many of you know, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0\"><strong>PART mainnet network is going to undergo a hardfork on the 1st of March 2019</strong></a>.

During this time, the team and\ncommunity testers have been hard at work identifying & fixing the last of the\nsmall issues still present in the latest testnet builds.\n\nWith a stable build nearing completion, it is imperative that Particl’s main\nnetwork is prepared for the addition of a privacy-focused decentralized\nmarketplace. The first step is a code update that will allow decentralized\ngovernance to work properly (with coin weight). Ahead of this, and a non-event\nfor most users, will be a hardfork of our Particl test network as well.\n\nHere are the things you need to know.\n\nPlanned Hardfork Schedule\nTestnet Fork (Particl Core 0.18)\n⭐️ 2019.02.16–12:00:00\n\n * VARIABLE SMSG FEE\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n * BULLETPROOFS\n\nMainnet Fork (Particl Core 0.17)\n⭐️ 2019.03.01–12:00:00\n\n * PAID SMSG\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTestnet Hardfork (16th of February)\n> 2019.02.16–12:00:00\nIn 4 days, on the 16th of February, Particl’s test network (testnet) is going to\nfork in order to merge a couple of features that have been sitting in RegTest\n(internal pre-testnet network) for some time now. If you are a Particl holder,\nthis hardfork doesn’t require you to do anything but, of course, it will allow\nyou to test these new features on our public testnet.\n\nBulletproofs\nThis testnet hardfork is going to include Bulletproofs, the Confidential\nTransactions protocol improvement that will reduce the size of CT/RingCT\ntransactions by ~70%. Bulletproofs is an important brick in Particl’s wall of\nprivacy as it will allow RingCT and CT transactions to be executed without\nbloating the blockchain and bringing its size to absurd levels. Privacy and\nscalability can and should go hand in hand.\n\nWhy make compromises when you can have the best of both worlds?\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nParticl has been working on a major new feature to its mobile app, Particl\nCopay; Cold staking capabilities! This testnet hardfork will add multi-signature\ncold staking support, meaning it will now be possible to cold stake funds held\ncollectively by multiple devices.\n\nThis will give users access to the utmost level of privacy Proof-of-Stake can\noffer.\n\nIn fact, cold staking from multi-signature addresses means users will need to\nhave access to more than one device to move funds around. This constitutes a\nsolid barrier to anyone looking into stealing coins as they would be required to\nget a hold of all of the signing devices.\n\n> Note: Ledger Nano devices won’t initially be compatible with multi-signature\ncold staking, however, Particl has already identified that, and with the help of\na custom script, it could be possible to make the hardware devices compatible.\nThis may not come immediately, but is good to know for future endeavors!\nVariable SMSG Fee\nThis feature is probably not an exciting one at first sight but will be very\nimportant when it comes to implementing advanced escrow features. This protocol\nimprovement allows SMSG messages to have various fees, allowing, for example,\ncustom escrow security deposit ratios (agree with the other party to put any %\nof the item’s value as security deposit instead of 100% every time). It won’t\nreally be possible to test variable SMSG in a practical way until this feature\nis integrated into the escrow system. But, it’s nonetheless an important feature\nmaking its way onto testnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainnet Hardfork\n> 2019.03.01–12:00:00\nIn order for the Open Marketplace to go live a couple things need to happen; the\ntrustless escrow system needs to be adapted to our OMP-library for blinded\nescrow (privacy), and Paid SMSG needs to be onboarded to mainnet. The latter\nrequires a planned hardfork which will happen on March 1st 2019, at 12:00 am GMT\n.\n\nHardforking is a pretty big deal, especially as it requires the greater majority\nof nodes to update in a timely manner. This requirement also applies to\nthird-parties and exchanges to ensure that they do not run an outdated fork of\nthe project. For this reason, Particl has already started contacting\nthird-parties last week to let them know the improvements coming to the Particl\nNetwork and be leaders in the shift to the new chain.\n\n> Note: for users of Particl Desktop and Particl Copay mobile apps, the clients\nwill automatically upgrade and sync with the correct chain seamlessly in the\nbackground. For most users both planned hardforks will be non-events but we\nwanted to responsibly let you know what is coming on March 1st.\nPaid SMSG Messages\nThis feature is necessary in order for the governance system to function\nproperly on mainnet. This is the missing piece that needs to be added onto\nmainnet (it already works flawlessly on testnet) so that governance votes (both\nproposals and listing flags) can be properly registered with coin weight.\n\nThe marketplace cannot release on mainnet without this critical feature.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nAs mentioned above, Particl will be hardforking multi-signature cold staking\ncapabilities onto testnet on the 16th of February. This will give 2 weeks for\ntesting properly this protocol enhancement after which it’ll merge onto mainnet\nat the same time as the paid SMSG message hardfork. This should reduce the risks\nassociated with executing hardforks by combining both these items into the same\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would also like to thank everybody that has helped them test\nthe latest testnet version of the marketplace. We are still working on preparing\nthe groundwork for the Open Marketplace’s mainnet launch, and wanted to relay\nparts of the critical path in an easy, step-by-step manner so everyone on the\nsame page.\n\nIn the meantime, you can relax and watch our latest AMA/FAQ Session\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoB1_rNWvEM], Paul’s latest interview with\nCryptoTradingFR (part 1 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN1bEatbNrQ], part 2\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI-lG14WktE&t=1s]), or just launch and play\nwith the latest testnet builds\n[https://particl.news/new-open-marketplace-testnet-builds-a45fbc699fc5] of\nParticl’s Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Upcoming-Hardforks/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"preparing-mainnet-for-a-private-decentralized-marketplace\">Preparing Mainnet for a Private, Decentralized Marketplace</h3><p>Over the past few weeks, Particl has started preparing the groundwork for Particl’s Open Marketplace first mainnet release.

This requirement also applies to third-parties and exchanges to ensure that they do not run an outdated fork of the project. For this reason, Particl has already started contacting third-parties last week to let them know the improvements coming to the Particl Network and be leaders in the shift to the new chain.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> for users of Particl Desktop and Particl Copay mobile apps, the clients will automatically upgrade and sync with the correct chain seamlessly in the background.

No new features is currently\nbeing implemented until the Alpha build is made entirely stable. Having a super\nstable build will make integrating new features on it much faster and easier and\nshould lead to more regular (and exciting) releases.\n\nThe Alpha Version Moves Up to Mainnet\nOnce the testnet Alpha version of the marketplace is fully stable and thoroughly\ntested, it will be moved up onto Particl’s mainnet, allowing you to purchase and\nsell real items using real PART coins. This milestone event will mark the end of\nthe Alpha phase of development and initiate the Beta phase.\n\nLimited Features\nThis first ever mainnet version of Particl’s Open Marketplace won’t require any\nsort of hardfork and will only contain a limited set of features. The features\navailable will be the same features that have been on testnet for some time.\nThis includes decentralized governance with coin weight, as well as the complete\nbuy and sell flow. Community proposals, although not directly a marketplace\nfeature, will also be live on mainnet.\n\nNo Privacy Enhancing Features in This Version\nIt’s very important to note that this mainnet version won’t be coupled with the\nRingCT hardfork yet, meaning that the MAD escrow system won’t be enhanced with\nit. This means that all marketplace transactions made on this version of the\nmarketplace will be pseudonymous, not anonymous, until RingCT is hardforked onto\nmainnet and integrated into the escrow system during Beta. You can rest assured,\nhowever, that no other data will be generated by the marketplace.\n\nThe Beta Phase Will be Focused on Adding New Features\nNew features will be introduced during the Beta phase and will be integrated\ninto existing testing builds as Release Candidates\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate].\nRelease Candidates will be released on testnet, and mainnet implementation of\nfeatures are not guaranteed until Beta mainnet.\n\nWhereas Alpha was focused on building the base layer for the marketplace, Beta\nwill be focused on integrating new features. A fully stable marketplace codebase\nwill result in quicker releases with something new to show for almost everytime,\nand it should also be a much more exciting phase for everyone than Alpha.\n\nBeta Starts as Soon as Alpha Ends\nThe Beta phase of development will start immediately after the Alpha phase is\ncompleted and moved onto mainnet. The next build that will follow the first\nmainnet version of the Open Marketplace will be a Beta build and will be\nreleased, like Alpha was up until the end, on testnet.\n\nTwo Development Branches Used During Beta\nDuring Beta, two types of branches, Development and Stable, will be used to push\ntestnet builds to the community.\n\nDevelopment Branch\n\nThe Development branch will be the first place where new features will be\navailable for community testing. Because introducing new features almost\ninevitably introduces bugs and issues, this may mean the Development branch\nmight not be super stable all the time. This is not ideal to get a good number\nof testers (if it’s broken all the time, people are less interested in testing\nthe builds) and to show friends. After all, what’s worse than showing a friend a\nbuild of Particl’s Open Marketplace only for it to crash in your face).\n\nStable Branch\n\nThis is where the Stable branch comes in. This branch will be used to push\nfeatures that have already went through a good number of tests and that have\nbeen fixed of most bugs and issues. While the Stable branch is still a testnet\nbranch, it will make builds much more stable and easy to share with friends.\nThis branch is the final step before a feature is introduced onto mainnet.\n\nA Feature’s Path to Mainnet\nWith this new strategy, a feature now has to go through one additional hoop\nbefore being implemented on mainnet. It first needs to be tested internally by\nthe team, then tested within the rougher Development testnet branch. Once rid of\nmost of its bugs and issues, the feature gets implemented onto the Stable branch\nfor its final round of testing. Only after this last step will it be ready to be\nintegrated onto mainnet.\n\nBiggest Milestone to Date\nThis mainnet release marks an important milestone for Particl. It separates it\nfrom the group forming the majority of blockchain projects that do not have any\nsort of product ready at this time and gives it an entry ticket into a much more\nlimited category of projects that have a product live on mainnet. What’s more,\nit will signify the beginning of a brand new phase for the project and the\ncommunity as it will now be easier than ever to spend cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to read more about Particl and decentralized and privacy-conscious\neCommerce in general?

This development update will explain in more details what is being\nworked into Particl Copay and what can be expected from the next few versions of\nParticl’s mobile application.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMobile Cold Staking\nOne of the big feature being coded into Particl Copay is the long-awaited cold\nstaking capabilities. In fact, it will soon be possible to connect your funds to\na cold staking node directly from your mobile application and help secure the\nnetwork while growing your PART stash at the same time. Note that, in this case,\nthe Particl Copay mobile wallet won’t be the device actually staking. The update\nwill only enable the possibility to cold stake your funds held on Particl Copay\nby delegating its staking power to a cold staking node.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nWhat if Particl’s Proof-of-Stake algorithm could be taken yet to another level?\nThis is what this next feature is going to do! Not only will Particl Copay’s\ncold staking update introduce the ability to connect your mobile wallet to a\ncold staking node, but it will also introduce multi-signature\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions] \ncold staking. This will allow you to stake your funds held in multi-sig\naddresses, requiring you to have access to more than one device to successfully\nauthorize and execute a transaction.\n\nFor the time being, this will only be compatible with Copay devices. This may or\nmay not change in the future, although the team has already identified ways to\nmake it compatible with Ledger hardware devices. As this feature requires a\nhardfork, it won’t be included in the next update of Particl Copay.\n\niOS Support\nAnother long-awaited feature for Particl’s mobile wallet is official support for\niOS. As many of you know, especially iPhone users, Particl Copay hasn’t been\navailable on iOS since its inception, but that’s about to change! The mobile\napplication has already started to see its code being upgraded\n[https://github.com/particl/copay/commits/master] to be compatible with iOS and,\nat that point, we are only waiting for Apple to confirm Particl’s Apple\nDeveloper Account. When that’s done, we’ll be able to publish the application on\nthe App Store whenever the update is ready to go live! This compatibility update\nshould be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nMulti-Currency Support\nA very useful feature that’s gonna be included in the next update is the ability\nto hold different coins in Particl Copay without having to use multiple wallet\napplications. Indeed, once the update goes live, Particl Copay will have support\nfor Particl, but also Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This should prove very useful\nwhenever Particl’s Open Marketplace starts accepting Bitcoin payments! This\nupdate will be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nUI/UX Improvement\nThose of you already using Particl Copay will notice it right away, this update\nwill introduce several UI/UX improvements all over the app. There is not much to\nsay about this in particular other than the fact that the mobile application has\nbeen improved visually and will offer all of its new features within a very\nuser-friendly and intuitive environment.

This development update will explain in more details what is being worked into Particl Copay and what can be expected from the next few versions of Particl’s mobile application.</p><hr><h3 id=\"mobile-cold-staking\">Mobile Cold Staking</h3><p>One of the big feature being coded into Particl Copay is the long-awaited cold staking capabilities. In fact, it will soon be possible to connect your funds to a cold staking node directly from your mobile application and help secure the network while growing your PART stash at the same time. Note that, in this case, the Particl Copay mobile wallet won’t be the device actually staking. The update will only enable the possibility to cold stake your funds held on Particl Copay by delegating its staking power to a cold staking node.</p><h3 id=\"multi-signature-cold-staking\">Multi-Signature Cold Staking</h3><p>What if Particl’s Proof-of-Stake algorithm could be taken yet to another level? This is what this next feature is going to do! Not only will Particl Copay’s cold staking update introduce the ability to connect your mobile wallet to a cold staking node, but it will also introduce <a href=\"https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions\"><strong>multi-signature</strong></a> cold staking. This will allow you to stake your funds held in multi-sig addresses, requiring you to have access to more than one device to successfully authorize and execute a transaction.</p><p>For the time being, this will only be compatible with Copay devices. This may or may not change in the future, although the team has already identified ways to make it compatible with Ledger hardware devices. <strong>As this feature requires a hardfork, it won’t be included in the next update of Particl Copay.</strong></p><h3 id=\"ios-support\">iOS Support</h3><p>Another long-awaited feature for Particl’s mobile wallet is official support for iOS. As many of you know, especially iPhone users, Particl Copay hasn’t been available on iOS since its inception, but that’s about to change! The mobile application <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/copay/commits/master\"><strong>has already started to see its code being upgraded</strong></a> to be compatible with iOS and, at that point, we are only waiting for Apple to confirm Particl’s Apple Developer Account. When that’s done, we’ll be able to publish the application on the App Store whenever the update is ready to go live! This compatibility update should be available in the next version of Particl Copay.</p><h3 id=\"multi-currency-support\">Multi-Currency Support</h3><p>A very useful feature that’s gonna be included in the next update is the ability to hold different coins in Particl Copay without having to use multiple wallet applications. Indeed, once the update goes live, Particl Copay will have support for Particl, but also <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and <strong>Bitcoin Cash</strong>. This should prove very useful whenever Particl’s Open Marketplace starts accepting Bitcoin payments!

We have a bunch of new features queued\nup on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll\nbe released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will\nbe different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the\nteam will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent\nand exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being\nconsidered/worked on by reading the South Africa development update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11] posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nQ&A Communications on Listing PagesWe do see in-client messaging integrated into\nthe shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of\nthis can be seen in a gif posted on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323] by our UI/UX and\nfront-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a\nseller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users)\ndirectly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&A format used on\nAmazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.\n\nAnother messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group\nchats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a\nstand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities,\nespecially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned \n/r/beertrade Reddit community [https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade]) directly\nwithin Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications.\nThis would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your\nday-to-day life.\n\n(3:49 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229]) Will there be a Decentralized\nExchange integration?\nThe team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration\nat this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team,\nfeel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will\nget some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace\nintegrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a\nreality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a\nChangelly or a similar third-party integration.\n\nWhile a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it\ndoesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the\nParticl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the\nshort-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and\nthat integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the\nvolume.\n\nExample of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)As such, we are\nactively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when\none of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then\nwe might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and\nthen integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d\nkeep the community in the know about any development on that front!\n\n(4:27 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284]) Moving forward, what role will\nMiguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?\nAll of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl.\nMost of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own\ncircles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s\nlatest videos that have been posted on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg] as well as in \nDeutsche Welle’s documentary [https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94] he and Lina Seiche\nwere featured on last month.\n\nDW’s Documentary:\n\nMeeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:\n\nHumans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:\n\nTo date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with\nagendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in\n2019, as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet, we’ll definitely be engaging each of\nour advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social\nmedia, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a\nvery different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production\nphase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of\ntremendous help.\n\nWith Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage\nmore with our advisors from SCI [http://sci.ph], Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon,\nand you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.\n\n(6:22 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382]) Can we expect a fiat gateway\nintegration into the Particl client?\nWe know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is,\nafter all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as\npossible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve\nthis, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one\nof our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of\npayment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream\ntype of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways\n\nWe need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We\nhave looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as\nIndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of\nprivacy and security.\n\nFor the time being, we know Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/] plans on tackling that\naspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!\n\n(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?\nOur legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are\nconstantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to\nplay by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are\nfully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal\nteam stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations.\nCompliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully\nintend on staying that way moving forward.\n\n(8:23 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503]) How will atomic swaps be\nincorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nExample of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)There are mostly\ntwo UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic\nswaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one\npath. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent\nof the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An\nimplementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps\nsince it would live independently of the marketplace.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n(9:05 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545]) What does Lina consider to be the\nmost exciting aspect about Particl?\nParaphrased from Lina:\n\n> I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting\nthings I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is\nobviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get\nacquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the\nhype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while\nand they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to\npush good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the\ncryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other\nprojects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one\nof the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an\nactual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about\nrevolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in\nthis bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you\nfind yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering,\nand that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about\nthe project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!\n\nParaphrased from Paul:\n\n> Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing\nParticl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are\npretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working\nproduct, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are\nstill stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for\ntheir talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well\nreceived in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working\nblockchain product.\n(11:58 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718]) Can you give us a brief summary of\nyour week in South Africa?\nWe have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa\ndevelopment meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nAside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of\nthe meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be\nimproved.\n\nAmong the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy\nfor Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into\ntwo branches: dev and stable. The dev branch will be the “experimental” one\nwhere new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break\nstuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very\nhelpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a stable branch comes\nin handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been\nproperly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration\nand testing purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during\nAlpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time,\neach development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring\nmore frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring\nfor testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation,\nprivacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about\ndeveloping the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new\nfeatures, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to\nbe added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of\ndevelopment to be very exciting for everyone!\n\nWe’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also finally\nrelease Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet. We’re currently in the last mile\nbefore our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious\nmilestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the\ncurrent Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes\nlive on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha\nversion of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.\n\nAnother topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was\nour decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and\nboots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement\nwe’ve made in December that we’d be attending Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event,\nTOKEN2049.\n\nParticl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nDirectly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at\nmore conferences around the world…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\n\n(15:01 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901]) Is there going to be a meetup\nin France?\nYes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ \nCoinHouse [https://www.coinhouse.com/] late in February. CoinHouse is the\nleading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France\n[https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php] \nwith over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It\noffers a wide array of services including educational information, investment\nadvice\n[https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686] \n (approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part\nof their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very\npopular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by\nthe France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the\nnow widely-known and popular startup Ledger [http://ledger.com], which now have\na product (Ledger Nano S) that is compatible with Particl for hardware storage\nand cold staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\nCoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities HEC\n[http://www.hec.edu/] and Polytechnique [https://www.polytechnique.edu/] and now\noffers blockchain classes to students.\n\nLa Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nLeading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nmedium.com\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\n\nThis event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team\nmembers, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from\nMubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.\n\n(16:52 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012]) Will there be another\nPARTaker Hub?\nWe have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into\nseveral ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in\ntime, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term\ngoal.\n\n(17:44 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064]) Will there be a coin weight\nfeature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a\ncompetitor) from the market?\nIt shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of\ngovernance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing\nseveral rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release\nand part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial\ngovernance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against\nabuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring\nhow the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready\nto make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not\nthe first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is\na hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet\nmodel perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve\nas we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!\n\n(18:32 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112])— What added value could SCI\nprovide for Particl?\nSimilarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging\nthe founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project,\nmuch more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the\nproject, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year,\ntheir expertise and network could become very handy.\n\nSCI - Home [https://sci.ph/]\nSatoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology\ncompany\nbuilding the Blockchain ecosystem in… [https://sci.ph/]sci.ph [https://sci.ph/]\n\nSatoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies\nin the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well\nreputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even\nadvise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing\nlots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their\ninfluence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.\n\n> Other Questions\nWhat’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?\nThe biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX\ngenesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in\ntime. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that\ndecentralized exchange.\n\nWhat about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?\nWe’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social\njuggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will\nbegin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter,\nYouTube, and Instagram in 2019.\n\nBoth Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own\nsocial calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of\neach other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are\ncryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream\nonline buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary\nfeatures required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.\n\nWhat about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed\nand if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?\nLarge-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release\ncontaining all the planned features that define that release. It could even be\nlater than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to\nmore “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than\nBeta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to\nwork on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our\nadoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest\nassured, these are absolutely planned.\n\nFor this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in\nniche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or\ncertain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies.\nIn other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more\nlimited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering\nthe most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will\nbenefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee,\ncensorship-proof, privacy, etc).\n\nAs Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new\nfeatures that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added.\nWhether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation,\neach new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a\nwider audience.\n\nWe already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly\nbenefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the\nmarketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so\nthese will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be\nable to accommodate their businesses.\n\nDo we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the\nbeta be testnet or mainnet?\nWe don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the\nmainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before\nthe end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working\non a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the\nhardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can\nbe included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.\n\nRegarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to\nmake a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our\ntesters have been helping within the community since May. So instead of\nreleasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product\nour Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha\nversion will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and\nwill mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.\n\nAdditionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability,\nit will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable\ntestnet builds to everyone and have a select and limited group of users running\nthe mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to\neveryone!\n\nFollowing the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin\nworking on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace\nrelease — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move\nour Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.\n\nBeta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for\nMarch 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t\nconstitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up\nto that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will\nfeature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the\nteam was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on\npopping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting\nstage of development for the community than Alpha was.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nWhen and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?\nThe team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It\nis really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl\nFoundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round\nto those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with\nthe Foundation itself.\n\nHow much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and\nwhen can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?\nA mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input\nat this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have\nwhen we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current\ntasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the\nmarketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.\n\nInterview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nOn the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert\nEdwards. I’ve had the chance to have several…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\n\nOn a related note, Particl Copay has a new senior developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nbringing it up-to-date and adding more features, such as the ability to hold\nother coins on the wallet itself (i.e. Bitcoin). Another update to the mobile\nwallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS\nintegration (currently being looked into).\n\nAre you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?\nWe’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being\ndeveloped as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be\nattached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules\nwill be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release\nof a new roadmap for the moment.\n\nWhat kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target\nmainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?\nWithout a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target\nmainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot\nwon’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some\nusers will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new\nfeature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online\nshoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase\nof many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream\nusers and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe\ndecentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit\nalmost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized\nmarketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.\n\nIt is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless\nsolution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any\nthird-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on\nany partner.\n\nWhen is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?\nDesktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is\ncurrently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently\ncompatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later\ntime — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.\n\nWhat is your marketing plan for 2019?\nSimilar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl\nProject and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in\nslightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.\n\nWith the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not\nincrease our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We\nwill promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news\ndoesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep\nthe marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.\n\nTo that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and\nmeetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of\nthe only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an\neffective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the\nproject moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people\nthat were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that\nremain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in\nthe tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the\nworld. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we\nare working towards making these real-life connections.\n\nSimilarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off\nemployees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl\nthough, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope\nwill end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our\nproducts.\n\nNote that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.\n\nAre we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?\nThis is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s\nentirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART,\nbut we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to\nensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require.\nWe strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized\nas a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise\nand the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working\non something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it\ncurrently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an\nactual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the\nproject and the talent of our developers.\n\nWhat are the other Dapps planned for Particl?\nThe team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each\nperson has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a\nyet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the\nMarketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp\nitself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the\ndeveloper SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start\nseeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their\nown Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal\n“dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are\nsome thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus\nfor now if we want it to release in a timely manner.\n\nAbout Particl.page [http://Particl.page], what is this website, what are\ntheir goals?\nParticl Page [https://particl.page]\nCommunity is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise. We want to\nstimulate a nice, friendly community around… [https://particl.page]particl.page\n[https://particl.page]\n\nIt’s an awesome community run website! They now have made a cold staking pool\navailable for their users, but as the website isn’t run by the team itself, we\ncannot say what other plans they have. They are somewhat active on Riot so don’t\nbe shy asking questions directly to them! (Riot user: @particl.page:matrix.org)\n\nDo we have other partners ready to handle the volatility of the escrow, the\ndouble deposits and which will allow mainstream users to pay in fiat using\nparticl in the background except for Mubiz? If it is not the case what is going\nto be done to have a worldwide coverage of partners ready to give Particl access\nto mainstream users?\nNothing as of yet. This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with\neverything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the\nteam is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be\nsometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version\nof the marketplace is planned.\n\nDo you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their\ntrade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be\nmade to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and\nquantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been\nmade already?\nNo studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party\nregarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good\nstudy to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement\nand can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.\n\nI think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.\nWe’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and\n“Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private\nmarkets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large\nbubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the\nprivate markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll\nprobably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great\ntoo!\n\nAlbin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact\nhim about that.\nSponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run\nanytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the\ndeveloper SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to\nthe whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and\nmarketplace features on Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

They used this opportunity to record an AMA/FAQ session to answer some of the questions that have been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/a0lbbf/amafaq_with_special_guest_lina_seiche_recording/\"><strong>asked on Reddit.</strong></a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uiefPZl6IEw?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Due to limited time and the unusually high amount of questions received for this AMA/FAQ, the team couldn’t answer all the questions while in Toronto but did so in the Reddit thread itself. For the purpose of this Community Update, we’ve compiled all the answers, including those answered in the video.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Video Questions</strong></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"-3-01-can-we-expect-in-client-messaging-for-the-main-net\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=181\">3:01</a>) Can we expect in-client messaging for the main net?</h3><p>In-client messaging will be a new feature introduced into the marketplace as we work towards a fully loaded main release. We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Q&A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&amp;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications. This would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your day-to-day life.</p><h3 id=\"-3-49-will-there-be-a-decentralized-exchange-integration\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229\">3:49</a>) Will there be a Decentralized Exchange integration?</h3><p>The team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration at this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d keep the community in the know about any development on that front!</p><h3 id=\"-4-27-moving-forward-what-role-will-miguel-cuneta-and-john-bailon-play-in-particl\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284\">(4:27</a>) Moving forward, what role will Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?</h3><p>All of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl. Most of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own circles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”.

We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well reputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even advise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing lots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their influence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.</p><blockquote><strong>Other Questions</strong></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-s-happening-with-the-particl-pivx-alliance\"><em>What’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?</em></h3><p>The biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX genesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in time. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that decentralized exchange.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-social-media-strategy-how-will-this-evolve-with-mainnet\"><em>What about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?</em></h3><p>We’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social juggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It is really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl Foundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round to those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with the Foundation itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-much-time-will-be-needed-to-release-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-and-when-can-we-expect-a-particl-copay-wallet-on-ios\"><em>How much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and when can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?</em></h3><p>A mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input at this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Another update to the mobile wallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS integration (currently being looked into).</p><h3 id=\"are-you-going-to-release-a-roadmap-with-a-timeline\"><em>Are you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?</em></h3><p>We’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being developed as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise.

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace?

It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one.

We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Q&#x26;A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&#x26;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications. This would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your day-to-day life.</p><h3 id=\"-3-49-will-there-be-a-decentralized-exchange-integration\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229\">3:49</a>) Will there be a Decentralized Exchange integration?</h3><p>The team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration at this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d keep the community in the know about any development on that front!</p><h3 id=\"-4-27-moving-forward-what-role-will-miguel-cuneta-and-john-bailon-play-in-particl\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284\">(4:27</a>) Moving forward, what role will Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?</h3><p>All of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl. Most of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own circles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It offers a wide array of services including educational information, <a href=\"https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686\"><strong>investment advice</strong></a><strong> </strong>(approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part of their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very popular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by the France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the now widely-known and popular startup <a href=\"http://ledger.com\"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, which now have a product (Ledger Nano S) that is <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>compatible with Particl for hardware storage and cold staking</strong></a>. CoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities <a href=\"http://www.hec.edu/\"><strong>HEC</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.polytechnique.edu/\"><strong>Polytechnique</strong></a><strong> </strong>and now offers blockchain classes to students.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><strong>La Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><em>Leading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\">medium.com</a></p><p>This event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team members, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from Mubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.</p><h3 id=\"-16-52-will-there-be-another-partaker-hub\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012\">16:52</a>) Will there be another PARTaker Hub?</h3><p>We have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well reputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even advise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing lots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their influence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.</p><blockquote><strong>Other Questions</strong></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-s-happening-with-the-particl-pivx-alliance\"><em>What’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?</em></h3><p>The biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX genesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in time. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that decentralized exchange.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-social-media-strategy-how-will-this-evolve-with-mainnet\"><em>What about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?</em></h3><p>We’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social juggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions.

That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise. We want to stimulate a nice, friendly community around…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.page\">particl.page</a></p><p>It’s an awesome community run website! <strong>They now have made a cold staking pool available for their users, but as the website isn’t run by the team itself, we cannot say what other plans they have.</strong> They are somewhat active on Riot so don’t be shy asking questions directly to them! (Riot user: <strong>@particl.page:matrix.org</strong>)</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-other-partners-ready-to-handle-the-volatility-of-the-escrow-the-double-deposits-and-which-will-allow-mainstream-users-to-pay-in-fiat-using-particl-in-the-background-except-for-mubiz-if-it-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-done-to-have-a-worldwide-coverage-of-partners-ready-to-give-particl-access-to-mainstream-users\"><em>Do we have other partners ready to handle the volatility of the escrow, the double deposits and which will allow mainstream users to pay in fiat using particl in the background except for Mubiz?

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be made to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and quantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been made already?</em></h3><p>No studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party regarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the developer SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to the whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and marketplace features on Particl.</p><hr><p>This concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

Of course, as there was a couple of presentations happening at the same time, the team did not get to see the entirety of the scheduled presentations, sometimes missing some due to networking outside of the rooms, but none of the ones we attended at live demos.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vfFNlVkVP_0?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"particl-in-the-philippines-manila-s-blockchain-christmas-fair\">Particl in the Philippines — Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair</h3><p><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\"><strong>14 Dec | Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair — BLOCKCHATS — Blockchain Events + Lifestyle</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\"><em>Browse the nerdiest Christmas fair of the year and grab merchandise, souvenirs, and your Christmas dinner from the…</em></a><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\">block-chats.com</a></p><p>On the 14th of December, Particl organized <a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/\"><strong>Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair</strong></a> alongside <a href=\"https://block-chats.com/\"><strong>Block-chats</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.coding-girls.com/\"><strong>Coding Girls Manila</strong></a>.

All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned.

The Particl Copay upgrades currently\nbeing worked on include multi-currency support (i.e. hold Bitcoin directly on\nParticl Copay), cold staking capabilities, iOS compatibility, and more.\n\nTo get to know Rob a bit better, don’t forget to read his interview published\non\nour blog\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nby following the link just above this section of the Community Update!\n\nParticl Core 0.17.1.0 Moves to Pre-Release Stage\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n\nTo get a strong start of the year, Tecnovert moved Particl Core 0.17.1.0 to its\npre-release stage, on mainnet. This means anyone can now download and install\nthis new Core update.\n\nIt’s important to note that, even though a lot of progress has been made on\n0.17.1.0 as it relates to the Trezor hardware wallet integration\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed], this\nupdate does not bring any new immediate feature or fix to Particl, and is being\npushed in the spirit of keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s at all\ntime.\n\nParticl’s Github Page Reaches 20,000 Commits\nOn December 12, Particl Core’s Github repository reached an interesting\nmilestone by registering it’s 20,000th commit (now standing at 20,185\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core])! This is both a testament to the\nteam’s relentless efforts at building the Particl platform and the benefits of\nkeeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s.\n\nParticl Ranks as the 11th Best Crypto Github Account of 2018\nAnother clear demonstration of what we mean when we say we’re out here to code\nand develop, not just hype and waste time, is the fact that Particl was ranked\nby CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] as the 11th best crypto Github project\nin 2018. CoinCodeCap is similar in nature to Darpal Rating\n[https://medium.com/dprating] (which unfortunately hasn’t put out any new Github\nranking for months) and ranks projects not based on price or marketcap, but by\nthe actual development being made to it.\n\nHere is how Particl ranked throughout the year in code rankings:\n\n * CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] (last 12 months) -> 21st\n * CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] (last 12 months) -> 11th\n * Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/dprating] (monthly) -> Constantly between\n   3rd and 7th, except for their last report where they oddly started taking\n   marketcap into consideration\n * Chinese KOL [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/962457662423273472] \n   (February 2018) -> 4th\n\nParticl’s Development Year in Review\nWe’ve just published an animation of all the work that’s been done over the year\non Github. Using the same open-source software we used for our Development\nTimeline blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513], we’ve\nfocused on the work done by the Particl team on all active Particl Github\nrepositories [http://github.com].\n\nIn the above video available on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg], developers with\ntheir names in green represent Particl team members while developers with their\nnames in white/grey are Bitcoin folks. Not only does this video proves that the\nParticl development team is relentless and very active, but also shows just how\nbeneficial keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin is.\n\nYes, it does look like Bitcoin developers are making commits to Particl Core,\nbut they’re really making commits to Bitcoin Core. The reason why they’re\nshowing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code\nis reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security,\nstability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly\nreflected on Particl Core. It’s like two teams working hand in hand!\n\nMubiz About to Release its New User Interface\n> \nFor those not aware of Mubiz, they are community members building a web\ninterface that will allow you to access Particl’s Open Marketplace directly from\nthe web as well as pay with more traditional means of payments than\ncryptocurrencies. Mubiz will also offer a wide array of services targeted to\nbuyers such as customer support, returns of products, reputation, shipping\nmanagement, escrow management (buyers won’t need to lock up extra funds), and\nmore. In other words, Mubiz seeks to make Particl’s Open Marketplace as easy to\nuse as any other traditional marketplace by building a service on top of the\nParticl protocol.\n\nMubiz announced this week that they will be releasing their new and improved\nuser interface tomorrow (Saturday the 5th of January 2019), and we are very\nexcited to see how it will look like!\n\nInfographics\nWe released two Open Marketplace infographics in December, if you missed those,\nhere they are!

All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards. To know all the benefits cold staking pools can bring you as well as the network, please read our blog post linked just below this paragraph.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3\"><strong>Cold Staking Pools — What You Need to Know</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3\"><em>Cold staking pools have been an item the community has been requesting for quite some time, and they are now available…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3\">particl.news</a></p><p>Very shortly after the release of the cold staking pool protocol, we were delighted to see three independently ran pools see the day.</p><ul><li><strong>Tecnovert’s Pool </strong><a href=\"http://66.172.10.231:903/\">http://66.172.10.231:903/</a></li><li><strong>Tecnovert’s Pool (Testnet)</strong> <a href=\"http://66.172.10.231:902/\">http://66.172.10.231:902/</a></li><li><strong>CryptoAcademie’s Pool</strong> <a href=\"http://167.179.93.172/\">http://167.179.93.172/</a></li><li><strong>Particl.Page’s Pool</strong> <a href=\"https://pool.particl.page/\">https://pool.particl.page/</a></li></ul><p>To get more technical information about cold staking pools as well as tutorials on how to connect to an existing pool or create one of your own, please read our dedicated Wiki pages linked below:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical information:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/pools\">https://particl.wiki/pools</a></li><li><strong>Join an existing pool:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_connect\">https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_connect</a></li><li><strong>Create your own pool:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_create\">https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_create</a></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKlmD9Fz-dg?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"interview-with-robert-edwards\">Interview With Robert Edwards</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

The reason why they’re showing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code is reflected whenever we update our codebase.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWhen is the RingCT and governance hardfork is going to happen?\nThere is no official date set for it yet, and the plan to combine RingCT and\ngovernance into the same hardfork hasn’t changed since we last spoke about it.\nTecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability,\nperformance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on\nmainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and\nso it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.\n\nDoes the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when\nthey are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and\ncan’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?\nIn short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a\ngood idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins\nand then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency.\nThis isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or\nimplemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus\nis mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note\nthat we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test,\nresearching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry,\nmeaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest\npriority.\n\nOne interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl\nMarketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and\nrequires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually\nlock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers\nneed to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’\nhonesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked.\nContrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply\nlocked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive,\nas everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a\nperfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up\nfor an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to\nbe more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future,\nmore Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock\neven more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed\nSDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire\nlarge sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior\nis akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).\n\nLooking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any\ndocumentation or internal chats?\nNo, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except\nfor Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately\n(as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of\nCharlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages.\nLike any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some\nmisbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead\ndeciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty\nconclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made\nagainst him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his\nbrand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.\n\nWill Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges\nlike Binance?\nIt seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community\nand chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to\ntimes regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this\nmay not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general\nthat this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are\nactually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s\nhappening surrounding the project.\n\nRight now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance,\nbut also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large\nexchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing\nfee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community\ngrowth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund\nmanagement strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds\nfor development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional\nfunding round will be in sight).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nStatus Report\nParticl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nAs always, a new Status Report was published at the same time we did our last\nlivestream. This report indicates a couple of items to be completed, such as \nuniformed height of listing items, drag’n’drop capability added when adding\nlistings, and proposals/votes to be based on time instead of blocks. Newly added\nto the In Development section are the governance system coin weight system, \nprivate markets, and proposal enhancements. As always, Tecnovert is still\nworking on improving the RingCT implementation with enhancements and \nBulletproofs. The current team meeting in South Africa is likely to shape future\nStatus Report and further the internal roadmap.\n\nConferences & Meetups\n> \nAs we have been saying lately, our intention is to start getting a more direct\nexposure by directly reaching out to the most passionate individuals of the\ncrypto scene by getting a better exposure at various crypto events. Nothing\nbeats the human interaction of discussing in-person the subject we are all\npassionate about!\n\n> \nOur newest team member, Lina Seiche, was specifically hired with this in mind\nand has already started integrating Particl into the blockchain presentations\nshe had already scheduled. Because she is seemingly falling in love with\nParticl, and also because of her own company, block-chats\n[https://block-chats.com/], it is to be expected that Particl will now be\nintegrated into most of their events, in some way or the other, in addition to\nthe Particl-themed events she’ll be organizing.\n\nAs such, she’s started planning the first of many future Particl-themed events.\nIn fact, on the 14th of December, Particl is going to hold its first official\nevent in Manilla, Philippines. This Christmas-themed Particl event will not only\nfocus on Particl but will also hold a panel of experts and well-known blockchain\npublic figures in that region. The panel will focus on eCommerce and why it is\nin dire need of decentralization and will be composed of leaders in the\nPhilippines blockchain industry such as:\n\n * Miguel Cuneta — Co-Founder of SCI [https://sci.ph/] & Particl Advisor\n * Mark Vernon — Founder of TagCash [https://tagcash.com/], a large\n   Philippines-based crypto company and very well-known within the Asian\n   community\n * Chris Verceles — Blockchain developer at Consensys [https://consensys.net/]\n * Colin Goltra — Head of Cryptocurrency Program at Coin.ph [https://coins.ph/]\n * Gerb Inajada — Head of Blockchain Technology at UnionBank\n   [https://www.unionbank.com/]\n * Alenna Dawn Magpantay — Philippines Ambassador for Coding Girls\n   [https://www.coding-girls.com/]\n\nFor more information about this event, please follow these links: \nhttps://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/ & \nhttps://www.meetup.com/BlockChatsPhilippines/events/256492831/\n\nWe’ve also have been reaching out to our key contacts within the French\ncommunity and are planning a meetup/conference in Paris shortly. We will give\nmore information about this one at a future time.\n\nParticl Chosen to Present at the Toronto CryptoCamp Blockchain Unconference\nHome [https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\nToronto | 29.11.18 Crypto camp Get your tickets!\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]www.cryptocamp.community\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\n\nParticl has been chosen among 80 applications to present its Particl Marketplace\nproduct at the Blockchain Unconference in Toronto on the 29th of November.\n\n> CryptoCamp is Toronto’s first-ever blockchain unconference.

Come\nto meet other crypto-curious and crypto-scaredies, and connect with\nprofessionals working in this space. This event is for you.\nThis conference is mainly focused on two things: education, and the presentation\nof actual products making use of the blockchain technology. This event will be\nhosted at the Deloitte Office in Toronto and will take place over two entire\nfloors.\n\nThe first part of the day will be dedicated to education. In fact, many speakers\nwill give educational talks about crypto and blockchain technology in general to\na wide audience of crypto enthusiasts. The second part of the day, which is when\nwe are scheduled to present Particl Marketplace to the crowd, is focused on\nshowcasing actual blockchain products. In fact, a series of speakers will each\nbe demonstrating their blockchain products in front of experts in the field and\nexplain how they foresee it making an impact on the industry they’re each\ntargeting. With around 80 submitted applications or so, the event has chosen\nParticl as one of the projects it wants to see presented!\n\nTickets for the entire event are available at this link\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-camp-at-deloitte-tickets-51716842468#tickets]\n, and we hope to have the chance to meet some of you who live close to Toronto.\nThis event is organized in part by CryptoChicks, a rather well-known blockchain\ngroup in Canada, and has partnered with several key sponsors such as Deloitte,\nShyft, BlockGeeks, TWG, and many more to make it a memorable moment. If you’re\naround the area and would like to come, let us know in advance so that we can\nmeet up at some point!\n\nSee the full list of speakers here: https://www.cryptocamp.community/speakers/\n\nDevelopment Team Meeting in South Africa\nThe team is currently meeting near Elizabeth Port in South Africa for its\nquarterly meeting.

Tecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability, performance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on mainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and so it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.</p><h3 id=\"does-the-particl-team-plans-on-integrating-a-lock-up-time-for-part-coins-when-they-are-unlocked-for-staking-so-that-coins-are-locked-for-a-longer-time-and-can-t-be-moved-staked-sold-before-your-node-finds-a-block\">Does the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when they are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and can’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?</h3><p>In short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a good idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins and then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake protocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency. This isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or implemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus is mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note that we have a Research &amp; Development team constantly putting up to test, researching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry, meaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest priority.</p><p>One interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl Marketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and requires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually lock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).</p><h3 id=\"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats\">Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?</h3><p>No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of Charlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages. Like any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some misbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead deciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty conclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made against him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his brand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-hire-a-market-maker-and-make-deals-with-bigger-exchanges-like-binance\">Will Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges like Binance?</h3><p>It seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community and chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to times regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this may not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general that this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are actually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s happening surrounding the project.</p><p>Right now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance, but also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large exchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing fee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community growth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund management strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds for development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional funding round will be in sight).</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"status-report\">Status Report</h3><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications</strong></a><br><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><em>Particl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy * Private…</em></a><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p>As always, a new <strong>Status Report</strong> was published at the same time we did our last livestream.

He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and so it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"does-the-particl-team-plans-on-integrating-a-lock-up-time-for-part-coins-when-they-are-unlocked-for-staking-so-that-coins-are-locked-for-a-longer-time-and-can-t-be-moved-staked-sold-before-your-node-finds-a-block"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Does the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when they are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and can’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a good idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins and then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake protocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency. This isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or implemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus is mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note that we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test, researching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry, meaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest priority."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl Marketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and requires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually lock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller).
