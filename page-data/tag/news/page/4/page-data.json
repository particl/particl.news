Indeed, you can now download and\ninstall the new desktop client and enjoy the most up-to-date Particl experience\navailable.\n\nUpdated Dependencies ✅\nThis new release introduces the update of a few critical back-end dependencies\nsuch as Electron and NodeJS, fixing some GUI and startup-related issues on some\nof the more recent Linux distributions.\n\nGeneral Bug Fixes and Improvements ?\nAside from the dependency updates, this new release fixes a variety of bugs and\napplies a few general-purpose improvements to the code and the user experience\nof both Particl Desktop and Particl Marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2.1 on mainnet: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.2.1 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop\nv3.2.1RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE\nVERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.2.1main0.21.2.90.3.101.7.0 UPDATES AND FIXES[general]\nUpdate...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1]If you happen to\nbe a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl Academy as your\nguide and reference book for getting along with Particl Marketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * There may be issues launching Particl Desktop 3.2 on some specific Linux OS\n   such as Manjaro. This is due to an issue with Electron and will be fixed with\n   the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. \n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes, it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Updates electron to v19 to fix GUI/Application-related startup issues\n   specifically with recent Linux updates/distro releases.\n * Updates the application to use nodejs v16 as a minimum version.\n\nMarketplace\n * Fixes some occurrences of the marketplace service startup failing not be\n   detected, resulting in the user interface showing the loading/startup panel\n   indefinitely.\n * The Buy page > Orders tab now has the activity indicator \"flashing\" (to\n   indicate pending user activity) for the correct buyer specific steps (fixes\n   an error introduced in v3.2.0).\n * Fixes the failure of a market promotion estimation not displaying the\n   relevant error message when the estimation fails, and instead would fall back\n   incorrectly to displaying a price of 1 PART per day.\n * When promoting a market, the UTXO count is now checked before any messages\n   are sent instead of after the market content message is sent: this should\n   prevent a common error cause where a market with an image is promoted but due\n   to insufficient UTXOs available the market itself is promoted but the image\n   is sent and the GUI shows that an error occurred (despite the actual market\n   being  promoted but without an associated image).\n * The SMSG keys for a market are now only removed from particl-core after the\n   market is successfully removed from particl-marketplace database (should\n   prevent an error with the removal of the market from the database from\n   stopping the marekt from receiving new listing items).\n * The Cart page > Shipping form now defaults the 'Save shipping profile'\n   checkbox to true if there are no addresses previously saved.\n * Adds the 'Add to cart' functionality for the listing item details modal that\n   is launched from the Chat Messages > Conversations tab (for Listing Item type\n   chats).\n * Removes the marketplace service's monitor functionality for now.\n\nWallet\n * Transaction table entries now display the confirmation count after the\n   transaction description rather than before it: this both keeps the layout\n   consistent, and prevents the transaction amount from being cutoff (half\n   hidden) when the application window is at its smallest dimensions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile this release is a minor one and is focused on bug fixing and general\nimprovements, we recommend installing it like any other desktop release. It\nintroduces a few important fixes, notably if you're on Linux, and standardizes\nthe user experience to a more polished and stable status.\n\nThank you for your passion and dedication to the Particl mission.

and liberty focused\napplications. Its network enables decentralized applications (dapps) and smart\ncontracts in a manner similar to Ethereum, Avalanche, and Solana. Particl,\nhowever, presents major differences from those other protocols.\n\nMost “dapp networks” make exclusive use of ‘smart contracts’ — automated\nprograms that run on blockchains and execute actions based on certain\nconditions. And while smart contracts deployed on blockchains are certainly\nrevolutionary, they can carry certain security risks and technical limitations —\nnotably in terms of scaling and data storage.\n\nTypically, in order to support smart contracts, a blockchain has to be built (or\nforked) from the ground up, with smart contract functionalities already in mind\nfrom the beginning. That’s because smart contract compatible blockchains usually\nrequire a VM integration for the smart contract code to execute.\n\nWhile smart contracts are often touted as the end-all-be-all of what makes dapps\npossible, there are a few other ways to build and deploy decentralized\napplications. Such is the case with Particl and its use of the SecureMessaging\n(SMSG) protocol.\n\nThe Issue with “Privacy-Focused dapps” Within the Web3 Community\nWhile a number of other dapp networks claim to offer “smart contracts with\nprivacy”, they usually focus on one or another aspect of what makes a dapp\nprivate. Unfortunately, they fail to check all the boxes that would truly set\nthem aside traditional web applications. They either:\n\n * Use traceable payments or traceable forms of currency;\n * Leak contract contents publicly to anybody, at any time;\n * Leak the IP addresses of their users, compromising the identity and privacy\n   of users;\n * Rely on third-party servers/nodes/hosts controlled by large corporations with\n   questionable ethics or intentions;\n * Are not entirely non-custodial, making it possible for coins to be lost,\n   stolen, or even seized by central authorities\n\nFor a dapp to be considered truly private, or truly decentralized, it should\nideally check all of these boxes. Else, they are just glorified “web2”\napplications trying to exploit users by capitalizing on the web3 hype, but\nwithout providing its promised benefits. And we know that is often the case, as\nwe’ve explored before [https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/],\nmaking it potentially very damaging to a user that expects to be acting in total\nprivacy or in full control of their assets when they are, in fact, not\n[https://bitcoinist.com/iranian-venezuelan-opensea-users/].\n\nTruly Decentralized Apps Done Different\nParticl does dapps too, as is quite obvious with the one-of-a-kind Particl\nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace], but it does so in a way that's\ncompletely different than the rest of the dapp networks. \n\nIts blockchain is built using the latest Bitcoin code, which, unlike its\nEthereum counterpart, does not support “turing-complete smart contracts”. It\ndoes, however, absolutely support smart contracts — just a more rigid and tight\nversion of them. Although already powerful enough to create wonderful\napplications without intermediary, Bitcoin smart contracts are also expected to\nexpand in utility with the integration of Taproot and the upcoming Taproot-based\nTARO protocol. Subsequently, PART will adopt these features.\n\nThe purpose of Particl’s blockchain within its ecosystem is many:\n\n * Allow users to send, receive, and hold an untraceable currency in a wallet or\n   through its dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace or the BasicSwap DEX);\n * Create and interact with smart contracts;\n * Allow for a community governance of its dapps and of the network as a whole\n\nNotably, the privacy-focused Particl blockchain does not take the role of\nhosting and running the ecosystem’s dapps, and does not manage any data\non-chain. That’s because that role is, most often than not, not managed by smart\ncontracts, but instead by a completely separate layer: the SecureMessaging\n(SMSG) P2P network.\n\nSecureMessaging (SMSG) — A Game Changer for Dapps\nThe SecureMessaging (SMSG) network is Particl’s secret sauce and what sets it\naside from any other “dapp networks”. It is its own custom-built and unique P2P\nmessaging network that stands at the very core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the \nBitMessage protocol [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network\nis a decentralized\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Decentralization] \nstorage network (DSN) that stores and transfers data across nodes in a\nprivacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).\n\nWhat SMSG does is enable a private and secure data transfer layer for dApps to\nleverage. Contrary to smart-contracts, which often run through centralized\nthird-party nodes, every user of Particl dapp is a SMSG node, ensuring an\noptimal level of decentralization but also making active and passive network\nanalysis much more complicated. \n\nAs a result, you create complex applications without middlemen and data mining\nwithout relying on over-complicated smart-contracts that may leave glaring holes\nopen for attackers to exploit. \n\nSMSG powers Particl dapps, like the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] and the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, but without\nbloating the blockchain with excessive data and without leaving any permanent\nrecord.\n\nSMSG's Network TopologySMSG occupies several important functions within the\ncurrent Particl ecosystem:\n\nData storage and transfer: The network can store almost any type of data and\ntransfer it from one user to another, or to the entirety of the network, in a\ncompletely end-to-end encrypted and decentralized manner. The identities of the\nsender and receiver(s) of that data remain anonymous at any point in time to\nunauthorized parties and there’s no server involved at any point of the process.\n\nSecure communications: Text, too, is data. The SMSG network allows for two or\nmore parties to communicate with one another through an instant messaging\nprotocol, without relying on any centralized servers. All messages are\nend-to-end encrypted and can never be decrypted by an unauthorized party.\n\nExecute smart escrow instructions: A critical part of the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] dapp is its unique two-party escrow system\nwhich relies on a simplified Bitcoin-style smart contract. Instead of coding\nseveral functions and conditions into the smart contract itself, which carries\nits load of risks and potential vulnerabilities, the Particl smart contract\ninstead listens to instructions received from the SMSG network based on the\naction of participating users. This simplifies the smart-contract process, which\nin turn limits vulnerabilities, and offsets the complex interaction with the\nescrow to the SMSG network. When it comes to smart contracts, simplicity is\nsecurity.\n\nHost marketplace listing content: Because hosting listing data (i.e., product\ndescriptions and images) directly on-chain can quickly bloat a blockchain and\nmake it incredibly large, the Particl Marketplace dapp relies on SMSG’s private\ndata storage functionality to store and provide that information.\n\nEnable complex DEX with orderbooks: With the help of SMSG and ‘scriptless\nscripts’, a type of off-chain smart contract, cross-chain DEXs can now exist\nwith complete order book functionalities that don't require central parties to\nstore and process its data. While the atomic swap technology lets two users swap\ncryptocurrencies with no intermediary, a secondary messaging layer is necessary\nto carry data between the two chains without the use of wrapped assets or third\nparties — which is precisely where most of the challenges related to cross-chain\nDEXs lie.  SMSG takes the role of safely and privately aggregating the\ninformation (order details, order prices, user actions, etc.) and communicating\nbetween users of two different blockchains, like Particl, Bitcoin, and even\nMonero.\n\nAs we can see, a lot can be accomplished with Particl’s basic smart contracts\nusing the SMSG network. It is what puts the Particl ecosystem in a league of its\nown and the reason why Particl’s dapps possess a level of privacy and\ndecentralization that is unmatched — there isn't any compromise and they truly\ncheck all the boxes mentioned in the section above!\n\nImproving SMSG Beyond its Current Capabilities\nAs we’ve seen, SMSG is a great P2P network that enables private data storage and\nprocessing, secure and encrypted communications, and even anonymous dapps. But\nit’s also faced with a significant challenge — that of scalability.\n\nIndeed, for all its glory, the SMSG network is limited in terms of scalability\nand could bottleneck when Particl reaches a large enough level of adoption.\nWhile it can support a lot of data and many thousand of messages per day, it\ncould hit its throughput limit should too many people use it at the same time,\nor if it’s made to support a particularly heavy data load.\n\nSMSG 2.0 — More Scalability and More Functionality\nThis is the reason why the Particl team plans, as part of its roadmap\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021#major-milestones], a major overhaul of\nits code, which includes the exciting release of SMSG 2.0. This SMSG update will\nmake Particl’s unique open source P2P network scalable enough to support any\nlevel of adoption — a must when building dApps that seek to challenge the status\nquo!\n\nAdditionally, it will not only support data storage and transfer anymore, but\nalso support the hosting and browsing of content on it, similarly to how the Tor\nnetwork functions. Imagine browsing web pages and using dapps straight from the\nSMSG network and without connecting to the \"clearnet\". That's where we're headed\nat!\n\nWe’ll be covering all the juicy details about SMSG 2.0 and much more information\nabout how it will power the Particl ecosystem moving forward in an upcoming\nParticl News blog post shortly, so, as always, keep your eyes peeled for future\nupdates coming to Particl News!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is a decentralized ecosystem of privacy-focused applications.

It is its own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network that stands at the very core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\">BitMessage protocol</a>, the SMSG network is a<a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-Decentralization\"> decentralized</a> storage network (DSN) that stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>What SMSG does is enable a private and secure data transfer layer for dApps to leverage. Contrary to smart-contracts, which often run through centralized third-party nodes, every user of Particl dapp is a SMSG node, ensuring an optimal level of decentralization but also making active and passive network analysis much more complicated. </p><p>As a result, you create complex applications without middlemen and data mining without relying on over-complicated smart-contracts that may leave glaring holes open for attackers to exploit. </p><p>SMSG powers Particl dapps, like the <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> and the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, but without bloating the blockchain with excessive data and without leaving any permanent record.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/06/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption><em>SMSG's Network Topology</em></figcaption></figure><p>SMSG occupies several important functions within the current Particl ecosystem:</p><p><strong>Data storage and transfer: </strong>The network can store almost any type of data and transfer it from one user to another, or to the entirety of the network, in a completely end-to-end encrypted and decentralized manner. The identities of the sender and receiver(s) of that data remain anonymous at any point in time to unauthorized parties and there’s no server involved at any point of the process.</p><p><strong>Secure communications:</strong> Text, too, is data. The SMSG network allows for two or more parties to communicate with one another through an instant messaging protocol, without relying on any centralized servers. All messages are end-to-end encrypted and can never be decrypted by an unauthorized party.</p><p><strong>Execute smart escrow instructions: </strong>A critical part of the <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> dapp is its unique two-party escrow system which relies on a simplified Bitcoin-style smart contract. Instead of coding several functions and conditions into the smart contract itself, which carries its load of risks and potential vulnerabilities, the Particl smart contract instead listens to instructions received from the SMSG network based on the action of participating users. This simplifies the smart-contract process, which in turn limits vulnerabilities, and offsets the complex interaction with the escrow to the SMSG network. When it comes to smart contracts, simplicity is security.</p><p><strong>Host marketplace listing content:</strong> Because hosting listing data (i.e., product descriptions and images) directly on-chain can quickly bloat a blockchain and make it incredibly large, the Particl Marketplace dapp relies on SMSG’s private data storage functionality to store and provide that information.</p><p><strong>Enable complex DEX with orderbooks:</strong> With the help of SMSG and ‘scriptless scripts’, a type of off-chain smart contract, cross-chain DEXs can now exist with complete order book functionalities that don't require central parties to store and process its data. While the atomic swap technology lets two users swap cryptocurrencies with no intermediary, a secondary messaging layer is necessary to carry data between the two chains without the use of wrapped assets or third parties — which is precisely where most of the challenges related to cross-chain DEXs lie.  SMSG takes the role of safely and privately aggregating the information (order details, order prices, user actions, etc.) and communicating between users of two different blockchains, like Particl, Bitcoin, and even Monero.</p><p>As we can see, a lot can be accomplished with Particl’s basic smart contracts using the SMSG network. It is what puts the Particl ecosystem in a league of its own and the reason why Particl’s dapps possess a level of privacy and decentralization that is unmatched — there isn't any compromise and they truly check all the boxes mentioned in the section above!</p><h2 id=\"improving-smsg-beyond-its-current-capabilities\">Improving SMSG Beyond its Current Capabilities</h2><p>As we’ve seen, SMSG is a great P2P network that enables private data storage and processing, secure and encrypted communications, and even anonymous dapps. But it’s also faced with a significant challenge — that of scalability.</p><p>Indeed, for all its glory, the SMSG network is limited in terms of scalability and could bottleneck when Particl reaches a large enough level of adoption. While it can support a lot of data and many thousand of messages per day, it could hit its throughput limit should too many people use it at the same time, or if it’s made to support a particularly heavy data load.</p><h3 id=\"smsg-2-0-more-scalability-and-more-functionality\">SMSG 2.0 — More Scalability and More Functionality</h3><p>This is the reason why the Particl team plans, <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021#major-milestones\">as part of its roadmap</a>, a major overhaul of its code, which includes the exciting release of SMSG 2.0. This SMSG update will make Particl’s unique open source P2P network scalable enough to support any level of adoption — a must when building dApps that seek to challenge the status quo!</p><p>Additionally, it will not only support data storage and transfer anymore, but also support the hosting and browsing of content on it, similarly to how the Tor network functions. Imagine browsing web pages and using dapps straight from the SMSG network and without connecting to the \"clearnet\". That's where we're headed at!</p><p>We’ll be covering all the juicy details about SMSG 2.0 and much more information about how it will power the Particl ecosystem moving forward in an upcoming Particl News blog post shortly, so, as always, keep your eyes peeled for future updates coming to Particl News!</p><hr><p><em>Particl is a decentralized ecosystem of privacy-focused applications.

3.2\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-live-on-mainnet/] and its messaging\nsystem behind us, it’s time to look into what exactly Particl Desktop 3.3 will\nbring forth to the table.\n\nFirst off, we’d like to mention that, following the release of Particl Desktop\n3.3, Particl will begin with its next major evolutionary phase by introducing a\nnew layer of distributed services. The concept we've built with Particl\nMarketplace undoubtedly works, and now it's time to unfold beyond our current\nscope and expand towards the wider Web3 environment. As we've highlighted\nrecently [https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], Web3 is the\npromise of an open, decentralized, non-custodial, immutable, and private web\nenvironment that is as easy to use as any other web service, but it's currently\nplagued by many issues which we fully intend on tackling with Particl's next\nevolutionary phase. More information about what Particl's next evolutionary\nphase entails will be communicated very shortly here on Particl News.\n\nWeb3 Exposed! Is it Only a Mirage?A cold hard and in-depth look into the\npromises and current realities of “Web3”.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]But for now, let's take\na look at what Particl Desktop 3.3 will bring to the table. This release focuses\non improving various back-end processes and improving the client’s user\nconfigurability to get Particl Desktop ready for the upcoming new major\ndevelopment cycle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 Items\nBefore getting into the list of deliverables for Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like\nto mention that this list is tentative, meaning that not necessarily all of the\nitems listed here will end up in the next update. In a way, this is more akin to\na wishlist than a definitive checklist, but this should give you a good idea of\nwhat we’re aiming for with this next update.\n\nNevertheless, let’s take a look at the items we’re currently looking into for\nParticl Desktop 3.3.\n\nUpdate Particl desktop Dependencies\nMostly a back-end maintenance task, updating the client’s dependencies keeps it\nup-to-date and ensures security issues don't creep in. Additionally, it makes\nsure no compatibility issues appear, such as we’ve seen recently with the\nFedora/Manjaro OS environments.\n\nParticl Desktop Startup Changes\nThis significant modification changes how the startup process runs by putting\nmore control into the user’s hands. Some of the changes for this include\nremoving the automatic download and/or start of particld on the start of Particl\nDesktop and adding various options like  download/start/stop/restart/auto-start\nto the user interface. Also included in this change is the ability to block the\nstart of different desktop apps unless Particl Core is currently running. This\nshould eliminate a few edge case issues and give users more control over their\nexperience, notably with the ability to improve their client performance based\non their specific utilization of it.\n\nAdd a Basic Settings and Configuration Implementation\nSimilar to the item mentioned above, a basic settings and configuration\nimplementation will enable users to tweak various settings right from the GUI.\nThis is a one-up over the currently available settings in Particl Desktop, this\nimplementation will let users tweak more settings and do so more granularly.\nThis implementation will touch on things such as indicating how to start/stop\nparticl-core (auto-start or manual start, for example), as well as various\nsettings related to download location, etc.\n\nUpdate Particl Desktop to Use Particl Core v22\nThis item is self-explanatory. Particl Desktop 3.3 will work over the more\nrecent Particl Core V22. You can consult the list of changes introduced by\nParticl Core V22 here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md]\n.\n\nParticl Market — Allow for the Deletion of Previously Published Templates\nThis widely requested feature from some of our current sellers on the\nmarketplace relates to the deletion of listing templates once they have been\npublished on a market or storefront at least once. This is a relatively\nsignificant change but will go a long way in improving sellers' user experience.\n\nParticl Market — Remove the Requirement for Markets to Belong to a Single\nIdentity\nExpanding on the concept of multiple identities, we're removing the restriction\nthat a market can only be joined by a single identity at a time. This will add\nthe ability for markets or storefronts to be accessed by different identities.\nOne notable benefit of this feature is the added privacy aspect of decoupling\nmarket ownership, vendor account ownership, and chat message identities.\n\nParticl Market — Remove the Reviews & Comments Section\nThis section, which doesn't seem to be used much, is now made redundant thanks\nto the introduction of the better chat functionality of Particl Desktop 3.2 now.\nFor this reason, we will remove its implementation from the system.\n\nParticl Desktop — Allow for Alternative PD Utilized URLs to be Supported\nThis should allow for supporting Tor-related links to various services.\n\nParticl Desktop currently makes use of various internet-related services, as\nwell as providing various web links that the user may click on for various\nreasons. For example, when checking for, and the downloading of, a new\nparticl-core version, Particl Desktop makes a connection to Github. Another\nexample is the links in the Help & Support section of Particl Desktop that\nprovide links to the social media sites of the Particl project (that open on the\nuser's browser when clicked on).\n\nThese links are all currently fixed and hard-coded. This can present a problem\n(particularly for the initial particl-core download on the first run of the\napplication), for those wishing to use Particl Desktop over Tor (or similarly\nrestricted environments) where access to public services/URLs such as Github\nmight be restricted or unwanted.\n\nThe solution aimed here is to remove these hard-coded URLs, allow them to be\nconfigurable as well (via the aforementioned PD Settings feature), and offer\nTor-related alternatives, if available, for those wanting them.\n\nParticl Market — Add the Ability to Purchase Digital Items\nThe ability to purchase digital items, or rather, items that do not require\nphysical addresses for shipping, is something we started looking into a while\nago. However, due to the significant changes it required, we put that\ndeliverable on ice for a little while. For Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like to\njump back into it and work towards making that a possibility.\n\nMinor UI Tweaks and Improvements, and Bug Fixes\nThere is a list of minor UI and UX tweaks we want to include in the desktop\nclient. This includes, but isn’t limited to, ordering of the listed markets,\nshowing a list of messages sent by a saved chat participant, and more.\nAdditionally, as always, there’s also a list of minor issues and bugs we want to\nfix for Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nStay Tuned for More Details on Particl’s Next Evolutionary Process\nAs mentioned above, we are planning on beginning with Particl's next\nevolutionary process right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. This\nprocess will not only introduce a new layer of distributed services to the\necosystem and bring Particl up to par with the expected level of accessibility\nfrom Web3 apps, but it will also improve said Web3 in many ways by tackling some\nof its most urgent issues, as we've highlighted in this Particl Story\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]. \n\nIn fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to\nmake the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers,\nvendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable\nwith established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work,\nand more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3\necosystem and community.\n\nIn other words, it is a major stride at increasing Particl’s aim for becoming\nthe go-to solution and hub for non-interference and privacy-first applications\nwithin the new but fast-growing Web3 community. Because, we believe people shall\nnot be the product and that corporate monopolies don’t help create a better\nworld.\n\nThere will be much more to talk about in detail and you’ll read it here first,\non Particl News in the coming weeks.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This release focuses on improving various back-end processes and improving the client’s user configurability to get Particl Desktop ready for the upcoming new major development cycle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-3-3-items\">Particl Desktop 3.3 Items</h2><p>Before getting into the list of deliverables for Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like to mention that this list is tentative, meaning that not necessarily all of the items listed here will end up in the next update. In a way, this is more akin to a wishlist than a definitive checklist, but this should give you a good idea of what we’re aiming for with this next update.</p><p>Nevertheless, let’s take a look at the items we’re currently looking into for Particl Desktop 3.3.</p><h3 id=\"update-particl-desktop-dependencies\"><strong>Update Particl desktop Dependencies</strong></h3><p>Mostly a back-end maintenance task, updating the client’s dependencies keeps it up-to-date and ensures security issues don't creep in. Additionally, it makes sure no compatibility issues appear, such as we’ve seen recently with the Fedora/Manjaro OS environments.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-startup-changes\"><strong>Particl Desktop Startup Changes</strong></h3><p>This significant modification changes how the startup process runs by putting more control into the user’s hands. Some of the changes for this include removing the automatic download and/or start of particld on the start of Particl Desktop and adding various options like  download/start/stop/restart/auto-start to the user interface. Also included in this change is the ability to block the start of different desktop apps unless Particl Core is currently running. This should eliminate a few edge case issues and give users more control over their experience, notably with the ability to improve their client performance based on their specific utilization of it.</p><h3 id=\"add-a-basic-settings-and-configuration-implementation\"><strong>Add a Basic Settings and Configuration Implementation</strong></h3><p>Similar to the item mentioned above, a basic settings and configuration implementation will enable users to tweak various settings right from the GUI. This is a one-up over the currently available settings in Particl Desktop, this implementation will let users tweak more settings and do so more granularly. This implementation will touch on things such as indicating how to start/stop particl-core (auto-start or manual start, for example), as well as various settings related to download location, etc.</p><h3 id=\"update-particl-desktop-to-use-particl-core-v22\"><strong>Update Particl Desktop to Use Particl Core v22</strong></h3><p>This item is self-explanatory. Particl Desktop 3.3 will work over the more recent Particl Core V22. You can consult the list of changes introduced by Particl Core V22 <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md\">here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-allow-for-the-deletion-of-previously-published-templates\"><strong>Particl Market — Allow for the Deletion of Previously Published Templates</strong></h3><p>This widely requested feature from some of our current sellers on the marketplace relates to the deletion of listing templates once they have been published on a market or storefront at least once. This is a relatively significant change but will go a long way in improving sellers' user experience.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-remove-the-requirement-for-markets-to-belong-to-a-single-identity\"><strong>Particl Market — Remove the Requirement for Markets to Belong to a Single Identity</strong></h3><p>Expanding on the concept of multiple identities, we're removing the restriction that a market can only be joined by a single identity at a time. This will add the ability for markets or storefronts to be accessed by different identities. One notable benefit of this feature is the added privacy aspect of decoupling market ownership, vendor account ownership, and chat message identities.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-remove-the-reviews-comments-section\"><strong>Particl Market — Remove the Reviews &amp; Comments Section</strong></h3><p>This section, which doesn't seem to be used much, is now made redundant thanks to the introduction of the better chat functionality of Particl Desktop 3.2 now. For this reason, we will remove its implementation from the system.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-allow-for-alternative-pd-utilized-urls-to-be-supported\"><strong>Particl Desktop — Allow for Alternative PD Utilized URLs to be Supported</strong></h3><p>This should allow for supporting Tor-related links to various services.</p><p>Particl Desktop currently makes use of various internet-related services, as well as providing various web links that the user may click on for various reasons. For example, when checking for, and the downloading of, a new particl-core version, Particl Desktop makes a connection to Github. Another example is the links in the Help &amp; Support section of Particl Desktop that provide links to the social media sites of the Particl project (that open on the user's browser when clicked on).</p><p>These links are all currently fixed and hard-coded. This can present a problem (particularly for the initial particl-core download on the first run of the application), for those wishing to use Particl Desktop over Tor (or similarly restricted environments) where access to public services/URLs such as Github might be restricted or unwanted.</p><p>The solution aimed here is to remove these hard-coded URLs, allow them to be configurable as well (via the aforementioned PD Settings feature), and offer Tor-related alternatives, if available, for those wanting them.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market-add-the-ability-to-purchase-digital-items\"><strong>Particl Market — Add the Ability to Purchase Digital Items</strong></h3><p>The ability to purchase digital items, or rather, items that do not require physical addresses for shipping, is something we started looking into a while ago. However, due to the significant changes it required, we put that deliverable on ice for a little while. For Particl Desktop 3.3, we’d like to jump back into it and work towards making that a possibility.</p><h3 id=\"minor-ui-tweaks-and-improvements-and-bug-fixes\"><strong>Minor UI Tweaks and Improvements, and Bug Fixes</strong></h3><p>There is a list of minor UI and UX tweaks we want to include in the desktop client. This includes, but isn’t limited to, ordering of the listed markets, showing a list of messages sent by a saved chat participant, and more. Additionally, as always, there’s also a list of minor issues and bugs we want to fix for Particl Desktop 3.3.</p><h2 id=\"stay-tuned-for-more-details-on-particl-s-next-evolutionary-process\">Stay Tuned for More Details on Particl’s Next Evolutionary Process</h2><p>As mentioned above, we are planning on beginning with Particl's next evolutionary process right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. This process will not only introduce a new layer of distributed services to the ecosystem and bring Particl up to par with the expected level of accessibility from Web3 apps, but it will also improve said Web3 in many ways by tackling some of its most urgent issues, as we've highlighted in this <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">Particl Story</a>. </p><p>In fact, this upcoming development cycle will change the approach adopted to make the entire ecosystem, and its apps, more accessible for developers, vendors, and customers. It will make it easier to use in general, interoperable with established 3rd party services, which vendors use on their day to day work, and more welcoming to integrate applications from and to the wider Web3 ecosystem and community.</p><p>In other words, it is a major stride at increasing Particl’s aim for becoming the go-to solution and hub for non-interference and privacy-first applications within the new but fast-growing Web3 community. Because, we believe people shall not be the product and that corporate monopolies don’t help create a better world.</p><p>There will be much more to talk about in detail and you’ll read it here first, on Particl News in the coming weeks.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Indeed, you can now download and\ninstall the new desktop client and enjoy all the new features, improvements, and\nbug fixes!\n\nMarketplace Messaging System ?\nNotably, this release introduces the widely-anticipated messaging system that\nallows sellers and buyers (and potential buyers as well) to communicate with\neach other. This new functionality is available in two different ways.\n\nOn one end, each listing now has a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask\nquestions to the seller. All messages posted in a listing's chatroom are\npublicly viewable, meaning anyone can see current and past messages sent this\nway.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\nProduct Codes ?️\nProduct codes allow a seller to uniquely identify their items according to their\nown predefined system. Note that this has no impact on the buyer side as the\nproduct codes are not publicly displayed along with a listing; they simply exist\nto provide some assistance to sellers in terms of inventory management. \n\nThe introduction of product codes is necessary for future additional features\nand for the deployment of the listing seeding system as detailed in this CCS\nproposal [http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nVarious Improvements ✔️\nAside from the two new features mentioned above, Particl Desktop 3.2 introduces\na few more improvements to both the marketplace app and the wallet. Check out\nthe full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0] or at the\nbottom of this blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2 on mainnet: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\n\nRelease v3.2.0 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop v3.2.0RELEASE\nINFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET\nVERSION 3.2.0mainnet0.21.2.90.3.91.7.0 UPDATES AND FIXES[market\nmodule]...GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0]If you\nhappen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * There may be issues launching Particl Desktop 3.2 on some specific Linux OS\n   such as Manjaro. This is due to an issue with Electron and will be fixed with\n   the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. \n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes, it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * The previous default market, the Open Market, is no longer joined by default\n   on a fresh/clean installation.\n * Navigating to the \"listings browser\" section, when no markets are joined,\n   will now indicate that a market needs to be joined (and present navigation\n   options to the \"market browser\").\n * If the Open Market market is not currently joined, the option to join this\n   market is displayed semi-permanently above the list of promoted markets\n   (making it available as an option for new users when no markets are actively\n   being promoted).\n * For users updating from earlier versions in which the Open Market was joined\n   by default, the ability to remove/un-join the Open Market is now available\n   (i.e., the market can be removed/un-joined just like any other market now).\n * An additional filter has been added to the Batch Publish Modal to allow for\n   the filtering of items that have previously been published to a selected\n   market.\n * Product codes, or unique seller codes for items, can now be specified for\n   different items. A product code can only be added to a product template but\n   it is visible on the market specific templates that are derived from the same\n   product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a\n   market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify\n   specific items.\n * The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page),\n   is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should\n   now be more easily identified.\n * Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing\n   messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any\n   chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages\n   are only visible between the buyer and seller.\n\nWallet\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI and functionality of the\nwallet module, for convenience:\n\n * An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration\n   input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at\n   the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or to\n   the beginning of the value only).\n * It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmations.\n * A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\"\n   to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. \n * Wallets are now grouped according to location/function. This all should make\n   wallet selection slightly easier particularly when a number of wallets have\n   been created.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.2 and the long-anticipated messaging system now out on\nmainnet, stay tuned for a follow-up blog post that will detail what's to come\nnext with Particl Desktop 3.3. and beyond ?\n\nWe hope you enjoy this new Particl Desktop release and thank you for your\npassion and dedication to the Particl mission.

publicly available on\ntestnet! You can now download and install the new desktop client and thoroughly\ntest all the new additions and improvements.\n\nUser Messaging (Marketplace) ?\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new Particl Desktop client update introduces a new and major\nmarketplace feature: user messaging. It lets sellers and buyers (as well as\npotential buyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form.\n\nUser messaging is available in two different ways. On one end, each listing now\nhas a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to the seller. All\nmessages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable, meaning anyone\ncan see current and past messages sent this way. This function is likely to\nreplace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get your feedback\nand thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet round.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\n> Note: At this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make\nit possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use\nParticl Marketplace.\nDefault Market Behavior ?\nStarting from Particl Desktop 3.2, the Open Market is not automatically joined\nby default anymore and it is also possible to leave that market.\n\nThis new approach gives you more control over your experience and will reduce\nyour market file size should you not be interested in what's on the Open Market.\nThe Open Market remains available to join at any time within the Market Browser\nand a link to join it is clearly displayed upon first launching the marketplace\napp (for newcomers/fresh installs).\n\n> Note: If you have already used Particl Marketplace in the past, your client will\nremain connected to the Open Market unless you manually leave it. \nProduct Codes ?️\nThis update introduces product codes to help vendor better manage their products\nand integrate their inventory into their already-existing inventory management\nsystems.\n\nProduct codes are unique identifiers that can be added to listing templates.\nThey are user-defined and do not show up publicly when publishing items on the\nmarket; they are purely intended as back-end information for the seller.\n\n> Note: This feature was a prerequisite for the deployment of the listing seeding\nproposal. [http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]\nAnd many more... ?\nThere are a lot of other UI and user experience improvements coming along with\nParticl Desktop 3.2. For a full list of these changes, refer to the change log \nhere [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001] or\nat the bottom of this blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2.0-RC-001: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.2.0 Public Testnet (release 1) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopTestnet release version for the upcoming v3.2.0RELEASE\nINFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET\nVERSION 3.2.0 (RC 001)testnet0.21.2.90.3.91.7.0 ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001]To get\ntestnet coins, visit the Particl faucet [https://faucet.particl.xyz/].\n\nIf you happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nPARTICL ACADEMY\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode\n   \"165.22.203.185:51938\" \"add\".\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * The Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\n   application can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * The previous default market, the Open Market, is no longer joined by default\n   on a fresh/clean installation.\n * Navigating to the \"listings browser\" section, when no markets are joined,\n   will now indicate that a market needs to be joined (and present navigation\n   options to the \"market browser\").\n * If the Open Market market is not currently joined, the option to join this\n   market is displayed semi-permanently above the list of promoted markets\n   (making it available as an option for new users when no market is actively\n   being promoted).\n * For users updating from earlier versions in which the Open Market was joined\n   by default, the ability to remove/un-join the Open Market is now available\n   (i.e., the Open Market can be removed/un-joined just like any other market).\n * An additional filter has been added to the Batch Publish Modal to allow for\n   the filtering of items that have previously been published to a selected\n   market.\n * Product codes, or unique seller codes for items, can now be specified for\n   different items. A product code can only be added to a product template but\n   it is visible on the market-specific templates that are derived from the same\n   product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a\n   market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify\n   specific items.\n * The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page),\n   is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should\n   now be more easily identified.\n * Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing\n   messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any\n   chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages\n   are only visible between the buyer and seller.\n\nWallet\n * An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration\n   input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at\n   the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or the\n   beginning of the value only).\n * It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmation.\n * A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\"\n   to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. Wallets are now also grouped according to\n   location/function. This all should make wallet selection slightly easier\n   particularly when several wallets have been created.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n * Please only use the .dmg file to install the application for Mac OSX 10.15 or\n   greater. The .app file extracted from the zip package does not currently run\n   on OSX 10.15 (although it should work correctly on 10.14 (Mojave) or\n   earlier).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned above, we would love to get your input on the deprecation of the\n\"Reviews\" functionality in favor of the new Chat system. Feel free to test it\nout, ask questions, and leave your remarks on our chatrooms, your thoughts are\ngreatly appreciated and help us shape a better product for the benefit of all!\n\nOnce a few days of testnet have passed and barring any major issue, Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release on mainnet.

The law was passed\nin the European parliament and targets European Union members and the companies\nthat wish to do business there – however, its presence has been noticeable in\nthe past few years all across the internet, especially in the form of a pop-up\non many websites asking you to confirm or alter the website’s use of cookies.\n\nThe Myth of GDPR and Consent-Based Privacy Regulations\nUnfortunately, the GDPR, and most other privacy or data-related government\nregulations, are little more than political grandstanding for\ndemocratically-elected governments to signal that they are \"doing something\"\nabout the increasingly prevalent issue of online privacy and data harvesting. As\na result, not much is changing in practice from a data collection and usage\nperspective. The same is true for most companies that have started to do\nmarketing out of their \"strong privacy policies\". It has become a marketing\nbuzzword, and when you dig deeper, you realize they are still collecting, using,\nsharing, and often losing your data.\n\nIn concrete terms, the GDPR and most other data regulations only require\ncompanies to disclose what data they collect and what they do with it. Then,\nthey have to get you to accept those terms and conditions. Oftentimes, if you\ndon't accept, you simply won’t be able to use the product or platform, or\nsometimes only in a limited manner. It is also an obvious fact that most people\nsimply accept TOCs without really reading them, since these \"requests for data\nuse\" pop up almost everywhere you go online now and just take too much time to\nproperly read through.\n\nOther times, for instance when you want to register to a marketplace like Amazon\nor Ebay, simply registering to the platform means that you agree to their TOCs\non data collection and usage. Don’t agree with them overlooking your every move?\nThen you are refused services and can’t do business on their platform. And you\nwould be well-advised not to accept these terms in many cases. After all,\ne-commerce data, such as data generated by online shoppers and vendors, is\nconstantly used to study certain business sectors in order to overtake them more\neffectively, especially in the case of Amazon\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015]\n. This results in honest sellers going out of business thanks to the very own\ndata they provided to e-commerce platforms. Deep down, do you really agree to\nthis when using a marketplace - or are you merely being coerced into accepting\nwhat's being imposed on you?\n\nThere seemingly is no real alternative to protect your data when browsing the\nweb anymore. All platforms collect your information, a lot of them lose it to\nhackers or due to gross negligence, and multiple parties still track your every\nmove, GDPR or not.\n\nThe Golden Promise of Decentralized E-Commerce\n\nDecentralized apps, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, and decentralized\nmarketplaces are in a prime position to tackle the issue from the core. The\nability to buy and sell anything with no middleman, directly person-to-person,\nand with no restrictions sends us back to the original principles of cash\ntransactions while transcending physical borders and promising equal access to\nall. Although in a nascent stage, it can be said for many to be the future of\ne-commerce.\n\nMany decentralized marketplaces, however, have a critical weakness that could\npotentially make them worse than even traditional marketplaces like Amazon. In\nthe case of traditional blockchain technology, all the data is tracked on a\npublic blockchain or over publicly-accessible networks. That oversight, combined\nwith increasingly sophisticated blockchain tracing and blockchain data mining,\nmeans all of that data is publicly viewable to anyone. So now, it's not just the\nmarketplace and its partners that have access to your data, it’s whoever is\ncurious enough to simply look it up. That’s bad if you're an individual, and\ncritically damaging if you are a business that ends up revealing their critical\ndata to competitors.\n\nIn some other cases, decentralized marketplaces are not entirely decentralized\nand various data sets go directly through third-parties or central authorities;\nessentially bringing us back to the very same core issues observed with typical\ne-commerce platforms built on traditional web technology.\n\nYes, the Solution is De-Commerce, BUT With Full Privacy\nThis is precisely the raison d’etre of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace]. We are delivering all the promises of\ndecentralized commerce (decommerce), but we're also fixing the critical issue of\ndata leaks and exposure by making it inherently private.\n\nEvery single aspect of the marketplace is private; from your transactions, to\nyour sales data, and all the way up to your browsing habits or even your network\nconnection. We don't track what you look for, how many seconds you look at one\nthing, or where your cursor wanders. The end result? Your personal and business\ninformation, shipping details, and network identity remain entirely private and\nsecure. You have total and uncompromising freedom to conduct business the way\nyou want to and with who you want to.\n\nOne thing is for certain: the best way to protect your data from leaks and abuse\nis to not have any data to collect in the first place. And that is precisely how\nParticl protects you. Whether you're buying or selling stuff on Particl, the\nmarketplace simply never ever generates any traceable or identifiable data about\nyou.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * The window title now correctly reflects the chain that the application is\n   started with, so as to more readily distinguish between running the\n   application on testnet or mainnet.\n\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Fixes an edge case when an order request might fail to be made despite\n   sufficient funds (and utxos) being available.\n * Fixes an order request not being able to be progressed by either buyer or\n   seller after being made, if the seller escrow amount required is 0.\n * Ignores received listing messages if the listing in the message has expired\n   by the time the listing message is processed. This means that the processing\n   of actual, valid listing messages are processed a lot sooner rather than\n   spending time processing messages that are not going to be useful to begin\n   with (i.e., faster time to see messages when joining a market), as well as\n   preventing the unnecessary updating of the \"pending new items\" refresh button\n   count with expired listings.\n * Adjusts the checking of available utxos when publishing listings to a market.\n   This should provide some measure of preventing cases where listings are\n   published without their associated images.\n * Prevents an order status from incorrectly being updated if the buyer attempts\n   to cancel an order in the \"escrow locked\" status but the seller has already\n   completed the escrow transaction and the buyer node simply has not received\n   the updated status message). Previously, the order status was incorrectly\n   updated to the \"cancelled\" status despite the cancellation request failing;\n   the status is now untouched if the cancellation fails.\n * Fixes listing and market images not being correctly removed from the\n   filesystem.\n * Removes the current listings associated with a market as well when a market\n   is un-joined, rather than leaving the listings and waiting for the listing to\n   expire before removing it.\n * Combines the market ID and applicable market key into a single value: rather\n   than needing to copy out 2 values for sharing access to a market, only one\n   value is now needed. The same applies for the market joining: only a single\n   value is needed to be entered, rather than 2 separate values.\n * Removes the 'Edit Product' button and instead places it inside of a separate\n   \"product info\" modal: this is to more clearly distinguish between editing of\n   a product template and a market-specific template (which tends to cause\n   confusion when a market template requires editing but the product template\n   edit action is more visible and tended to be used more readily instead).\n * Changes the displayed graphic and accompanying text when browsing a market\n   with no listings: a different graphic (and text) is now displayed when the\n   blockchain is still syncing, to clearly distinguish why there may be no\n   listings currently available.\n * Re-sends the escrow complete message in addition to the shipping message when\n   a seller re-sends the order status at the shipping step. If the buyer side\n   was missing the escrow complete status message then re-sending the shipping\n   status alone is insufficient to update the buyer status, so both the escrow\n   complete and shipping status messages are resent at the shipping status step.\n * Updates the error to more accurately reflect the reason for failing to\n   publish a listing when the listing itself is successfully published, but one\n   or more images in the listing are not correctly published.\n * Fixes the display of an order item's shipping value to correctly display the\n   actual shipping value used.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs Particl Desktop 3.1.1 fixes various bugs and issues that were encoutered by\nlive users, we invite those users to give this new update a spin and report back\nif any issue still persists (which shouldn't be the case).\n\nWe thank you all in the community for testing Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace extensively and reporting back.

A bit earlier today, on this 1st of February, 2022, the\nParticl blockchain has successfully hardforked and activated Taproot!\n\nThe hardfork also includes other items such as a fix to the dynamic marketplace\nlisting fees, the addition of dynamic supply (the blockchain adjusts its\ncirculating supply whenever PART gets burned), and an improvement to the SMSG\nnetwork which allows for more messages to be funded from a single transaction.\n\nTo see the first post-hardfork block (#1,113,123) , check out this link\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/3c32fe749dbd6d1f50254d966dc2248d621ffc603beee8b52481a6bcb63082db]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings the ability for Particl applications (i.e., Particl\nMarketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) to gain more privacy\nand cost smaller transaction fees.\n\nTaproot—More Privacy, Less Fees\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. It improves the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction,\nmaking the P2P network more efficient.\n\nFixing Dynamic Marketplace Listing Fees\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower.\n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability had been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, at some point in the past, the fee\ntarget amount dropped below a particular threshold and the code didn't allow it\nto change anymore (up or down). This hardfork fixed that issue by clamping the\nminimum amount it can change to 1 sat, making the feature functional and\nallowing stakers to adjust listing fees again. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] to learn how you can\nhelp reduce the marketplace listing fees.\n\nAdding Dynamic Supply\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThe hardfork also re-enabled a small number of disabled outputs from people who\nhad missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and haven’t\nput up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the steps\nmentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].

This team proposal is just one example of what anyone can\npropose to Particl stakeholders.\nTable of Contents\n * Progress Since the First Funding Request\n * The Funding Request in Details\n * Vision and Development Priorities\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Since the First Funding Request\nAbout 6 months ago, the Particl team started drawing funds from the treasury\nafter its first funding request was approved by Particl stakeholders. Since that\ntime, we’ve worked on improving and expanding the ecosystem with various\nimprovements and additions. \n\nHere’s a brief list of what we’ve done since being granted funds from the\ntreasury.\n\n * Particl V3 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/])\n * Particl V3.1 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/])\n * Announce BasicSwap, a cross-chain and private DEX, and prep it for its open\n   beta (learn more [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/])\n * New Particl.io website (check it out [https://particl.io/])\n * New roadmap (check it out [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/])\n * Published our short to mid-term marketing plans (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/])\n * 10 Particl Core releases, including 0.21.x.x pre-releases (learn more\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Scheduled a new hardfork to fully activate Taproot (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/])\n * Particl Electrum wallet with Lightning Network support (work-in-progress\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-10-09-2021#particl-core-development-report]\n   )\n * New legal entity formed to support the project\n\nRoadmap Progress\nAside from the project-wide milestones mentioned above, we’ve also made great\ndevelopment progress. Here are the roadmap items we’ve completed or made\nprogress to during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We announced that we would be releasing a new app into the Particl\necosystem; BasicSwap. BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange (DEX) protocol that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another\nwithout any middleman or third-party being involved. It is currently in closed\nbeta; its open beta is expected to begin very shortly in early 2022. \n\nWeb framework Although we haven’t officially communicated on this yet, we’ve\nmade preliminary progress in building certain aspects of what will allow Particl\napps, like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap, to be accessible from the web. We\nwill be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are\nlikely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at\nonce. We’ll have more information to share a bit later on. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality We’ve released an update to the cold staking zap\nfunctionality that allows for more a granular management of the zapping process.\nThe process has been optimized and made more private. You can also now choose\nbetween two zapping options; optimized for staking or optimized for privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Although not yet released, we’ve worked on a new light wallet\nfor Particl: Particl Electrum. It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum\nwallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need\nto sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in\nsome of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides\n\"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the\nblockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the\nLightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to\nParticl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment. \n\nTaproot Support In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the\nlong-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new\nfeatures and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/]. \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import/management We added to Particl Desktop 3.1 many\nimprovements to the inventory management aspect of the marketplace. Sellers now\nhave access to more options when importing their inventory from CSV files and\ncan easily adjust their product prices in bulk to account for any PART price\nchanges. A notable variety of other improvements related to the management and\npublishing of listings has also been added. \n\nAdjustable escrow deposit ratios A major item we’ve completed with Particl\nDesktop 3.1 is the addition of a customizable security deposit ratio for\nmarketplace escrows. Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock\n100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security\ndeposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with\nParticl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios\nbetween 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from\nmarketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and\nuse-cases. \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two major additions mentioned\nabove, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added\nto Particl Marketplace. Because there is way too much to mention here, we invite\nyou to check out the full list of changes available here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements Various additions, improvements, and bug\nfixes have been made to Particl Desktop. These are changes that are not\nexclusive to the marketplace app itself. Just like with the general marketplace\nimprovements, the list of changes is too big to put here; we invite you to check\nout the full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nThe Funding Request in Details\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests supporting the Particl team and funding its\noperations by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for 6 months\n. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will\nthen publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes\nother than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be\nallocated.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap\n   (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile\n   platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the\n   development team.\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this\n   funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words,\n   not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds\n   being available for later on.\n * Management, legal, and administration (10%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (10%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing\n   (and promotion) budgets.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the\nteam. \n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide\nfunding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related\nactivities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the\nteam may rearrange it as needed.\nVision and Development Priorities\nAfter spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a\nlot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind\nyou, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year,\nthere’ll be much more to show for it.\n\nIn fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s\nthe time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger\ndifference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much\neasier than it was before.\n\nDevelopment Priorities\nWith this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6\nmonths. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we\nconstantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be\nadded to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an\never-evolving situation.\n\nFor more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by\nfollowing this link [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/].\n\nNew Roadmap Revealed (2021)Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn\nabout the next critical steps forward.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/] General\nBasicSwap DEX BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022.\nWith its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and\npublicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to\nannounce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that\nregard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other\nlevel, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s\ngeneral adoption and exposure within the space. \n\nWeb framework The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl\napplications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser\nwithout the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to\ndownload any application. This item will be delivered in increments and we\nexpect that we'll deliver some of the first components of this system during\nthis development cycle. It is a major part of making Particl more accessible to\nthe world and easing its adoption. \n\nKeeping Particl Core up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin code As you probably\nalready know, the Particl coin is a next-generation privacy coin. It uses RingCT\nand CT, much like Monero, but uniquely uses the Bitcoin codebase. As is usual,\nwe pledge to keep its code up-to-date with all the Bitcoin updates, which is\ncritical both in terms of security and usability. \n\nParticl Electrum This new Particl light wallet, based on the very popular\nBitcoin Electrum wallet, provides a lot of “light” functionalities that can be\nleveraged for the many projects we have in mind, notably putting together a new,\nbetter mobile wallet for example. Although that mobile wallet might not see the\nday during the first half of 2022, we expect that, at least, Particl Electrum\nwill. \n\nSMSG 2.0 To ensure that Particl can sustain a much larger number of users, and\nto improve the reliability and performance of applications such as Particl\nMarketplace and the BasicSwap DEX, an update to Particl’s SMSG network is\nplanned for 2022. While we don’t fully expect it to be ready by the end of this\n6-month development period, we are confident that we’ll be making valuable\nprogress towards it. \n\nMarketplace\nBuy flow messaging This Particl Marketplace feature will let buyers and sellers\ncommunicate directly from within Particl Desktop. This is a widely-requested\nfeature that will massively improve the user experience of the marketplace and\nimprove its potential for adoption. This is a preliminary version of a more\ncomplete “chat application” that will eventually serve as a distributed and\nprivate alternative to messaging applications such as a Signal, Telegram,\nElement, etc. \n\nMobile and web gateway (buyers) As we incrementally build components of the web\nframework, they make available some low-hanging fruits. This is the case, for\nexample, of both a web and mobile gateway for buyers. They would make it\npossible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and\npurchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain\nand SMSG network. The early versions of these gateways are expected to be\nrelatively basic but will serve as a good showcase of what the web framework\nwill ultimately allow. \n\nDesktop\nSMSG controller integration The SMSG controller is more of a back-end\ndeliverable that improves how Particl applications interact with the SMSG\nnetwork. While this item may not lead to apparent changes to the end-user, it\nmakes Particl applications more efficient and lets them support more complex\nfeatures. This is a requirement for more advanced SMSG functionalities such as\napplication extensions and desktop plugins (formerly known as “SMSG bots”). \n\nApp extensions and plugins App extensions and Particl Desktop plugins are\nadd-ons that enhance the user experience. Often, they are third-party services\nthat provide valuable functionality such as allowing you to swap\ncryptocurrencies from the desktop app, get price data through oracles, and so\non. While Particl itself is entirely decentralized, these opt-in modules provide\nuseful features that might require third-parties to get involved. By being\nopt-in rather than opt-out, we ensure that only those looking to use those extra\nservices have to deal with the added level of centralization they require. \n\nHardware wallet integration Another widely-requested feature from some of our\nmost security-conscious community members, building hardware integration into\nParticl Desktop will let you connect your favorite hardware wallet (i.e.,\nTrezor, Ledger Nano) and manage the funds it contains without having to use a\nseparate Particl wallet (Particl-Qt). This will let you use Particl Desktop, and\nits applications, without having to make security compromises. \n\nMarketing\nAs for marketing, our plans remain in line with what we’ve recently announced a\nfew weeks ago in our marketing blog post\n[https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/]. Indeed, we intend to\nkeep on gradually ramping up various marketing and outreach efforts as our line\nof products expands and as the barriers to adoption are taken down by the\nrelease of new key features.\n\nHowever, we are planning for a bigger marketing push related to the full release\nof BasicSwap. As we’ve mentioned in the past, we are highly confident in the\nimpact this upcoming DEX will have on the project, not only because of its\nobvious usefulness for the project but also because of the added exposure it\nwill bring to the ecosystem.\n\nDon’t forget, trading is still the number one use-case for cryptocurrencies and\nit’s becoming harder to trade by the day as most exchanges are becoming\nincreasingly restrictive; the release of BasicSwap comes at a very opportune\ntime and will fix a lot of the issues traders face nowadays.\n\nHow to Vote\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this Particl Wiki tutorial\n   [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.

We will be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are likely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at once.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock 100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security deposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from marketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and use-cases.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat3_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat3_chck3\">A ton of general improvements</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Aside from the two major additions mentioned above, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added to Particl Marketplace.

Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors.

These will take the DEX to a whole other level, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s general adoption and exposure within the space.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck2\">Web framework</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl applications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser without the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to download any application.

Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%.

Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, <strong>the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\"><strong>Funding Distribution Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it.

With its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and publicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other level, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s general adoption and exposure within the space.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck2\">Web framework</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl applications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser without the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to download any application.

As we’ve mentioned in the past, we are highly confident in the impact this upcoming DEX will have on the project, not only because of its obvious usefulness for the project but also because of the added exposure it will bring to the ecosystem.</p><p>Don’t forget, trading is still the number one use-case for cryptocurrencies and it’s becoming harder to trade by the day as most exchanges are becoming increasingly restrictive; the release of BasicSwap comes at a very opportune time and will fix a lot of the issues traders face nowadays.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-vote\">How to Vote</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Voting on Proposals | Particl Project Wiki</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Voting on Proposals</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.wiki/favicon/favicon-32x32.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl Project Wiki</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.wiki/particl-wiki-symbol.svg\"></div></a></figure><ul><li>To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, <strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#\">click here</a></strong>.</li><li>To learn how to vote, refer to <strong><a href=\"https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/\">this Particl Wiki tutorial</a></strong>.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Important:</strong> For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running the latest version of Partyman.

One, in the\nOrders section, lets you resend your last action (i.e., mark the item as\nshipped) in case it hasn't properly been received by the other party. The other,\nin the Market Settings, lets your client rescan previous actions by the other\nparty, in case that it is your client that failed to receive it. If you have\nmarketplace transactions that are seemingly stuck, these buttons will fix the\nproblem.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.1 on mainnet: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]\n\nRelease v3.1.0 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop v3.1.0NB!!

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Fixes various typos, incorrect button labels, and incorrect text/label\n   related concerns.\n * Update to using core v0.21.\n\n> Note that for new users, a default wallet is not automatically created, and so\nthe initial wallet generation (when using the wallet module as the first entry\npoint) will allow for a wallet name to be provided.\n> The particl-core setting txindex will be explicitly enabled by automatically\nupdating the particl.conf file.\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Allow for backing up the market profile mnemonic and passphrase. These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience.

These are generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.</li></ul><blockquote>Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so backing up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile are backed up as well.</blockquote><ul><li>Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.</li><li>Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the sender's machine.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search criteria under certain cases.</li><li>When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop receiving smsg for that market.</li><li>Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees slightly.</li><li>A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the sending of smsg.</li><li>The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it contains.</li><li>Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market service was starting up.</li><li>Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater visibility when a value is missing.</li><li>The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.</li><li>The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.</li><li>In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed) is shown alongside the refresh button.</li><li>Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).</li></ul><blockquote>Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes afterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to occur.</blockquote><ul><li>Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of items in the batch publish modal.</li><li>Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:</li></ul><blockquote>This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor) as well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for further details).<br><br>These values can be viewed in the listings detail window.<br><br>Do note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's details as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when non-standard escrow ratios are used.<br><br>Orders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any additional information that may be needed.</blockquote><ul><li>A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.</li><li>Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.</li></ul><h3 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h3><ul><li>Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.</li><li>Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored and for the user to regain access to their coins.</li><li>Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.</li><li>A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default value used.</li><li>Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.</li><li>Fixes an issue in using a very high <code class=\"language-text\">inputs_per_sig</code> value on anon related transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.</li><li>Updates the <code class=\"language-text\">locked</code> balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc command <code class=\"language-text\">getlockedbalances</code> for this purpose. The previous means attempted to calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong values.</li><li>Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview page).</li><li>Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative measure.</li><li>Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value. The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.</li><li>The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.</li></ul><blockquote>The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the initial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.</blockquote><ul><li>The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per transaction.</li></ul><hr><p>Particl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It improves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by introducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace vendors.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone” release, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial 3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a new dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information about what items are planned to be included in the next update in a follow-up blog post that will be published to Particl News very shortly.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode\n   \"165.22.203.185:51938\" \"add\".\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * The Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\n   application can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n * The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source code.\n   Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\n   source code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval\n   of time has passed.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Fixes various typos, incorrect button labels, and incorrect text/label\n   related concerns.\n * Update to using core v0.21.\n\n> Note that for new users, a default wallet is not automatically created, and so\nthe initial wallet generation (when using the wallet module as the first entry\npoint) will allow for a wallet name to be provided.\n> The particl-core setting txindex will be explicitly enabled by automatically\nupdating the particl.conf file.\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Allow for backing up the market profile mnemonic and passphrase. These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information on the 3.2\ndeliverables as 3.1 goes live on mainnet.\n\nThanks for your time and help properly testing Particl Desktop 3.1; it ensures\neverything works as expected and speeds the mainnet deployment process. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This blog\npost will let you know everything you need about the hardfork and about how to\nprepare ahead. Let’s jump in directly and look at the details more closely.\n\n> Note: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.18\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18] or greater if\nyou haven’t already done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will\nlead you to connect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other\npeople will not be relayed and you won't be earning staking rewards.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardfork Schedule\nIn the first place, Particl’s testnet will hardfork on the 1st of January 2022,\nat 17:00 UTC. This will provide the ability for everybody to ensure that\neverything goes as expected. \n\nThen, on the 1st of February 2022, at 17:00 UTC, Particl's mainnet network will\nhardfork.\n\nPrepare Ahead\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and ensure future functionality of\nyour Particl apps, you need to update your Particl Core node to the latest\nversion available [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]. \n\nOnce you've updated your node(s), you don't need to do anything; you'll\nautomatically fork to the right chain, along with the rest of the network, on\nthe 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC.\n\nThe update procedure differs depending on your environment.\n\nParticl Desktop\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, close it down completely and re-open it. The\nclient will update itself automatically. Look at the bottom left corner of your\nclient; the \"core\" version should display 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Partyman\nIf you are cold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, enter\nthis command to update your node.\n\ncd ~/partyman && ./partyman update\n\nVerify that the update went on as expected by executing this command.\n\n./partyman status\n\nThe displayed version should be version 0.19.2.18 (or greater).\n\nParticl Core - QT Wallet\nWith a standalone Particl Core - QT wallet, you need to download and install the\nlatest version manually.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.18 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019218Hashes121365dec50e99eba4c25a2d7ff2a1e968949717bd0d8d6706c3f172fd596373\nparticl-0.19.2.18-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/latest]Particl Copay\nIf you use the mobile Particl Copay wallet, then no user interaction is required\nfrom you. The core version will be updated automatically in time for the\nhardfork.\n\nPART Coins on Cold Staking Pools\nIf you stake coins on cold staking pools, then you don't need to do anything\nother than to ensure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with Particl\n0.19.2.18 or greater. \n\nHowever, you must be aware that if the pool you're staking on doesn't update\ntheir nodes in time for the hardfork, you'll be staking on the wrong chain and\nthus, won't be receiving rewards. For this reason, make sure the cold staking\npool you're staking on updates in time. You can usually do this by appending \n/version or /api/version at the end of the pool's URL (i.e., \nhttps://coldstakingpool.com/api/version). \n\nIf you are the operator of a pool, please follow these instructions\n[https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.md] to\nupdate your node.\n\nPART Coins on Exchanges\nWe have started reaching out to exchanges on which PART is available in\npreparation for this hardfork.\n\nAs is usual, no customer interaction is needed as exchanges manage their own\nnodes. However, make sure your own personal wallet is up-to-date with the latest\nversion of Particl Core.\n\nWhat’s New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings more privacy and smaller transaction fees to Particl\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], \nBasicSwap [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) and for a\nwide variety of transaction types.\n\nparticl-core/fork-notes.md at master · particl/particl-coreParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/master/doc/fork-notes.md#rct-bug-fix-fork-3]\nTaproot\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction.\n\nFixing listing fee adjustment feature\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower. \n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability has been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, once the fee target amount drops below\na certain point, the code won't allow it to change anymore (up or down). This\nhardfork fixes that issue by clamping the minimum amount it can change to 1 sat,\nmaking the feature functional and allowing stakers to adjust listing fees again.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThis hardfork will also re-enable a small number of disabled outputs from people\nwho’ve missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and\nhaven’t put up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the\nsteps mentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\nFailure to submit your claim before the hardfork will mean you’ll have to wait\nfor the next one. If you don’t have any disabled outputs, or simply don’t know\nwhat this is about, then you don’t need to do anything here.\n\n> Note: The deadline to submit your claim for this hardfork is on the 1st of\nJanuary 2022, at 17:00 UTC.\nReducing money supply when outputs are burned (for future use)\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis hardfork is an important one for the ecosystem, notably with the major\naddition of Taproot and the fix to the listing fee adjustment mechanism. \n\nWe recommend that you update your node(s) as soon as possible; failure to do so\nin time for the hardfork will result in you being on the wrong chain.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It contains valuable information still\nvalid to this day regarding adjusting the listing fees of Particl Marketplace.\nPlease consult the table of contents to jump to the relevant section or click\nhere.\nOn the 12th of August 2019, the Particl Open Marketplace launched live on\nmainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-is-now-live-on-mainnet-bed75988b690]\n. This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving\nany data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the\neCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open\nMarketplace is still a Beta piece of software.\n\nThat means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for\nmass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means\nthis current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect\ntesting ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be\nimproved.\n\nIndeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the\ncommunity of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different\nperspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more\nquickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click me)\n * Dynamic Listing Fees\n * Why are Listing Fees Needed\n * High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\n * Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic Listing Fees\nOne of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of\nParticl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an\nitem or service up for sale. \n\nLuckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its\ncommunity of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true\nfor Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. \n\nFor this reason, it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees\nof the marketplace. It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk\nyou through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main\nimplications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That\nwill serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much\nyou want to change the listing fees of the network.\n\nWhy are Listing Fees Needed?\nThere are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing\nitems. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is\nthe ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very\nappealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.\n\nFighting Spam\nThe first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because\nthere is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any\nperson with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from\nspamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees\nto introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low\nend, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings,\nthen it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.\n\nThat’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the\nsame reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or\nParticl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized\nnetworks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no\nrecourse.\n\nKeeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date \nAnother lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to\nkeep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore.\nThat’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation\npowers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite\nproblematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for\na certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the\nseller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order.\nPretty annoying, right?\n\nHow listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on\ntwo factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc)\nand the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you\nset your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system\nworks in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a\nfinancial cost to its duration. \n\nTheoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then\nit is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of\nthe listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.\n\nIncentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network\nAnother important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the\nsecurity of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. \n\nIn fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to\nstakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards\nwill keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a\ngreater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the\nnetwork effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to\nspread the word around in an organic manner.\n\nHigh Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\nBefore you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is\nimportant to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some\narguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both\nperspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.\n\nLower fees\n * Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller\n * Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nHigher fees\n * More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the\n   marketplace and higher barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater\n * Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nIt’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller\nstaking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards \nper listing published, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on\nthe marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more\nindividual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.\n\nTutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\nSo you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but\ndon’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact,\nsince Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast\ntheir target listing fee to the network.\n\nA Community-Powered Tug-of-War\nOne staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he\nwants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community\nconsensus.\n\nListing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week\n(10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by\nstakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a\nconstant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the\nsmsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is\nstaked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee\ntargets broadcast by stakers. \n\nThe smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then,\nonce the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current\nsmsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th\nblock.\n\nThis can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war. Each staker broadcasts\nto the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace\n(higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards\nor downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers\nwant fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If\nthe majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget\nwill slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want\ndramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a\nmuch faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to\ntheir side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a\ndigital game of tug-of-war.\n\n> Note (01-12-2021): The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and\nimproved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee\ntarget at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.\nThe fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small\nincrements enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the\nprocess of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and\nunpredictable changes).\n\nPut the current value into perspective\nTo get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the\ncurrent market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into\nperspective.\n\nNote: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3\nimages per item and 1000 chars of text.\n\n# Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43\n\nIn the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100\nlistings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale\nwith Particl Marketplace.\n\nNow, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So,\nideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should\nget increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is\nneeded.\n\nBroadcast a Different Listing Fee Target\nThe way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're\ncurrently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two\nthings:\n\n * Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget\n * Broadcast your desired target to the network\n\nIf You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt\nIf you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet\n“unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is\npretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of\nsmsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. \n\nTo do so, simply open up the <console> and enter the smsggetfeerate command.\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nconsole window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns\nthe value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This\nis important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast\ndepending on your preference.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the\nfollowing command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target\nyou want to set.\n\nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nFor example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you\nwould put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then\nsimply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. \nNote that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.\n\n> Important: If you already have a custom stakingoptions parameter, like a custom \nrewardaddress, for example, then please enter the following command into the\n<console> and replace addr by the rewardaddress you set up previously: \nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nIf You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node\nIf you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need\nto broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. \n\nTo do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that\nyou can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and\nenter the following command:\n\n./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nterminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. \n\nAt the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255.\nThis means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to\nknow as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your\npreference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first\nupdate your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:\n\ncd partyman && git pull\n\n Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:\n\n./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget\n\nThis command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that\nyour node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a\nnew target or not. If you wish to do so, type y to move forward through the\nprocess. \n\nOnce that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your\ndesired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if\nyou would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the\nvalue at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the\nvalue at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve\nchosen and written your new target, press Enter to apply the change and start\nbroadcasting it to the network. Note that your desired value has to be 8\ndecimals or less.\n\nIf You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your\ndesired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking\nnode or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your\nliking.\n\nIf You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different\ntarget, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following \nthis link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md]\n.\n\nIf You’re Not Staking\nIf you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the\nnetwork. This is a golden opportunity for you to get started with staking and be\npart of Particl’s fully decentralized consensus-finding process. If you want to\nget started with cold staking, simply follow the steps available in this\nParticl\nAcademy tutorial\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/guides/guide_mp_general_enable_staking.html]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow you’re all set to start broadcasting your listing fee target rate to the\nnetwork. Take note that, at this time, the fee adjusting feature is not optimal\nand may result in negligible changes only. In the next hardfork (early 2022),\nthe feature will be significantly improved and made more effective. But it's\nnever too early to set up your node in the meantime!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

You find yourself in the right place! In fact, since Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast their target listing fee to the network.</p><h3 id=\"a-community-powered-tug-of-war\">A Community-Powered Tug-of-War</h3><p>One staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he wants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community consensus.</p><p>Listing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week (10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by stakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a constant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the smsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is staked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee targets broadcast by stakers. </p><p>The smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then, once the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current smsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th block.</p><p><strong>This can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war</strong>. Each staker broadcasts to the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace (higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards or downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to their side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a digital game of tug-of-war.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note (01-12-2021):</em></strong><em> The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and improved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022.

So, ideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should get increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is needed.</p><h2 id=\"broadcast-a-different-listing-fee-target\">Broadcast a Different Listing Fee Target</h2><p>The way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're currently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two things:</p><ul><li>Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget</li><li>Broadcast your desired target to the network</li></ul><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-either-particl-desktop-or-particl-qt\">If You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt</h3><p>If you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet “unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is pretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. </p><p>To do so, simply open up the &lt;console&gt; and enter the <code>smsggetfeerate</code> command.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image.png 1269w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the console window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns the value <code>23255</code>. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the following command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target you want to set.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}</code></pre><p>For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> If you already have a custom <em>stakingoptions</em> parameter, like a custom <em>rewardaddress</em>, for example, then please enter the following command into the &lt;console&gt; and replace <em>addr</em> by the <em>rewardaddress</em> you set up previously: </blockquote><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}</code></pre><h3 id=\"if-you-re-cold-staking-coins-on-a-staking-node\">If You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node</h3><p>If you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need to broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. </p><p>To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and enter the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate</code></pre><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the terminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. </p><p>At the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first update your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd partyman &amp;&amp; git pull</code></pre><p> Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Adjusting-Listing-Fees/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>This command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that your node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code>y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve chosen and written your new target, press <code>Enter</code> to apply the change and start broadcasting it to the network. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your desired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking node or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your liking.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-operating-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different target, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md\">this link</a></strong>.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-not-staking\">If You’re Not Staking</h3><p>If you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the network.

This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving any data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the eCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open Marketplace is still a Beta piece of software.</p><p>That means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for mass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means this current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect testing ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be improved.</p><p>Indeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the community of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different perspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more quickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.</p><hr><h2 id=\"table-of-content-click-me-\">Table of Content (Click me)</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"dynamic-listing-fees\">Dynamic Listing Fees</h2><p>One of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of Particl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an item or service up for sale. </p><p>Luckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its community of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true for Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. </p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees of the marketplace.</strong> It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk you through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main implications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That will serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much you want to change the listing fees of the network.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed?</h2><p>There are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing items. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is the ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very appealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>The first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because there is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any person with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from spamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees to introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low end, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings, then it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.</p><p>That’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the same reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or Particl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized networks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no recourse.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-the-marketplace-content-up-to-date\">Keeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date </h3><p>Another lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to keep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore. That’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation powers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite problematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for a certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the seller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order. Pretty annoying, right?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image-4.png 1313w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>How listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on two factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc) and the duration it stays listed on the marketplace.

To broadcast your target, you need to do two things:</p><ul><li>Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget</li><li>Broadcast your desired target to the network</li></ul><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-either-particl-desktop-or-particl-qt\">If You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt</h3><p>If you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet “unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is pretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. </p><p>To do so, simply open up the &#x3C;console> and enter the <code class=\"language-text\">smsggetfeerate</code> command.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image.png 1269w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the console window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns the value <code class=\"language-text\">23255</code>. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the following command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target you want to set.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"smsgfeeratetarget\"</span>:0.00000001<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div><p>For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325.

It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.

expanding its ecosystem with\na brand new distributed application: BasicSwap.\n\nBasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol\nthat allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another without any middleman or\nthird-party being involved. It lets you make or take orders on a distributed\norder book and execute swaps that are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and\nprivate. To find out what makes it a one-of-a-kind DEX, keep on reading this\nblog post!\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeParticl’s\nupcoming DEX is powered by the atomic swap technology\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/a-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/] \nand the SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, making it entirely decentralized and devoid of any central operator. No KYC,\nno trickery, no false promises. Just pure decentralization and privacy. And yes,\nin case you were wondering, it is fully compatible with Monero (XMR) and will be\nright from the get-go! ?\n\nIn this blog post, we will take a deep look into this new Particl distributed\napplication. We’ll detail how it’s going to fit in as a critical component of\nthe Particl ecosystem and, perhaps even more importantly, ensure the personal\nfreedom and financial sovereignty of its users.\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Particl Ecosystem Explained\n * The BasicSwap DEX Explained\n * List of Compatible Coins\n * Key Features\n * Monetization\n * How Does it Compare?\n * Why is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\n * Open Beta Coming Soon\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem Explained\nThe first step to understanding the significance of BasicSwap’s upcoming release\nfor Particl is to get a good grasp of what the Particl ecosystem is.\n\nParticl Marketplace, accessible through Particl DesktopParticl is an ecosystem\nthat gives you the ability to live completely free by cutting off middlemen\nentirely. It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights,\nfreedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy\ndevelopment, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy\nthat people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other\nwords, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.\n\nIn many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of\n“decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key\nservices or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can\nalso see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is\nan ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any\nthird-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly\nimportant step towards that vision.\n\nIn fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially\nindependent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and\nunstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is\nrequired. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through\ncentralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While\ncentralized exchanges (i.e., Bittrex\n[https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART], WizardSwap\n[https://wizardswap.io/]) can provide many benefits and unique features, not\nhaving any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be\nuncompromisingly independent. But that’s all about to change!\n\nNow let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a\ncornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will\nbecome a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that\nend up on it.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX Explained\nKeeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely\nindependent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell\nor trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast,\nand decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to\ndo, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeBasicSwap\nis a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency\nfor another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. \n\nSwaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a\ndistributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is\ndecentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you\ncan check the code yourself!\n\nList of Compatible Coins\n * Bitcoin\n * Monero\n * Particl\n * Litecoin\n * Namecoin\n\nWe are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens,\nshortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled\ncryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing\nblockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may\nbecome available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration\nroadmap.\n\nKey Features\nBasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers\nmany benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing\nfeatures that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.\n\nDistributed Order Books\nBasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of\nswapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or\nPancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book\n(maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been\nplaced on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap\nmore akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading\non, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.\n\nNote that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s\norder book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of\ncentralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by\ndesign, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and\nthat's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s\nown P2P network, SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, which is the same network that powers Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].\n\nThe main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at\nthe exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more\ntraditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to\nsmart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of rug pulls\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/] and\nother theoretical exploits they carry.\n\nBut there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be\ndeployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being\nlooked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as\nsoon (™) as we can!\n\nTrue Cross-Chain Swaps\nParticl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other\nDEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one\nnative coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!\n\nYou can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e.,\nMonero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different\nEthereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require\ncoins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart\nChain, or other similar chains).\n\nThe World’s Most Private Trading Exchange\nTo top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well,\nit means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send\ndocuments, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary\nmaximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and\nwithout any care about who you are or where you live.\n\nThat’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become\nway too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively\nincrease your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins\nlike Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy\nbetween two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). \n\nIndeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you\nswap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (\nConfidentialTransactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation]),\nor anon (RingCT\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other\nprivacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).\n\nBut there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and\ndeploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style\ncurrencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other\nwords, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a\nBitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective\nblockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!\n\nIndeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta.\nThat's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable\nfunctionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!\n\nThe combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the\nworld’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will\nmake you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live\nfree...because, well, now you can!\n\nOther Interesting Features\nThere are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap\nwill become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected\nto grow gradually.\n\n * True Monero support\n * No account, sign up, or KYC\n * Incredibly low and competitive fees\n * User-friendly interface\n * No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point\n * Taproot compatible\n * Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)\n\nWhat About Monetization?\nAs BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from\nswaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we\nabsolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will\ncause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that\nthe DEX was the missing piece all along.\n\nIndeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for\nusing the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the\nentire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the\nDEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or\nused as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely\nto be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy\njust yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.\n\nIn other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as\nmore people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the\nPART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your\nstaking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on\nthe Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).\n\nKeep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little\nfriction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive\nwith industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.\n\nHow Does it Compare\nWe know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and\ndecentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and\noffers something quite unique.\n\nIn the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from\nother trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some\nof the other solutions around.\n\nBittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.  Compared to centralized exchanges... \n\nYou control your keys at any point in time You don't have to create an account\nor submit any document You don't need to verify yourself (KYC) There's no upper\nlimit as to how much you can trade per period of time You remain private every\nstep of the way There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at\nall \n\nUniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.  Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools… \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want Swaps are truly cross-chain; no wrapped token\nrequired (i.e., wBTC) Providing liquidity is done in a more traditional way\nusing order books (as opposed to liquidity pools) There's no rug to pull (read\nmore about the infamous rug pulls here\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/]) \n\nBISQ  Compared to the BISQ exchange... \n\nThe process of swapping is entirely decentralized and done between two people No\nsecurity deposit or escrow intermediary required Fees are lower Swaps are atomic\nby nature, you can’t be scammed or tricked by bad actors \n\nCOMIT  Compared to the COMIT network... \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want You can swap a vast selection of cryptocurrencies;\nit’s not exclusively Monero-centric Uses the SMSG network to safely execute\nswaps All options and steps are available from a user interface \n\nWhy is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\nUtility Impact on Particl\nThe most obvious reason for BasicSwap to be is to provide the Particl ecosystem\nwith an independent, autonomous, and private way to swap, buy, and sell the\nnative currency of the platform (PART) for as many other cryptocurrencies as\npossible.\n\nEarly mockup of a BasicSwap integration into Particl Desktop | Work-in-progress\nthat is subject to changeRelying on centralized exchanges and partners can\nprovide useful solutions and avenues to trade PART, but it makes the entire\necosystem dependent on them which is an unbearable risk. With BasicSwap, Particl\nbecomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of\nthe project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl\npermanently unstoppable!\n\nPromoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty\nAt this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies\nyield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon\nbillions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both\ncentralized and decentralized.\n\nFurthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish\nto impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life,\ncentralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more\nand more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of\ntrading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to\naccentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a\nParticl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting\nthousands if not millions of users, daily.\n\nWith this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows\ndarker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By\ngiving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to\nanother, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows\npeople to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.\n\nAs a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or\nrestrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you\nare, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s\nentirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to\nattract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from\nthis audience.\n\nExposure for the Project\nBecause of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all\ninterconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start\nusing other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to\naccentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop.\nAfter all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains\nas well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you\ndo (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).\n\nFor this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms\nof communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as\na complement to the marketplace.\n\nThat being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for\nParticl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions\nworth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of\nfeatures is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.\n\nIndeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation,\nreleasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a\nmajor bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the\ngood word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community,\nit’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new\nproduct other than the marketplace!\n\nEasier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace\nAll payments on Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] are\nprivate. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to\nuse it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT\nprivacy state (click here to learn more\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications]\n) are located.\n\nAnd because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.)\nwork using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires\nnew users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from\ntheir public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a\nsignificant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a\nsimple solution to that problem.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of\nyour choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for\nexample, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready)\nbalances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART\nusing your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to\nuse the marketplace right away!\n\nIncreasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards\nAs you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit\nthe entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is\nset in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand\nfor PART, reduce its circulating supply (burning coins), and introduce\nincentives for providing liquidity.\n\nOf course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as\npossible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also\nimportant to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to\nuse, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what\nmonetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!\n\nWhen is the Open Beta Going Live?\nCurrently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for\nseveral months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just\nabout to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we\nexpect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year\npresent to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be\nconsidered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.\n\nWhat to Expect From the Open Beta?\nBy any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will\nstill very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough\nexperience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name\nimplies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX\nand to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast\nselection of environments and situations.\n\nHere are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.\n\n * Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins\n * Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More\n   coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full\n   release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the\n   number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a\n   bigger focus.\n * You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions.\n   There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but\n   rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify\n   onboarding as much as possible.\n * A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at\n   least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups\n   that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test\n   the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more\n   advanced types of users.\n * You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap\n   (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on\n   taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.\n * As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t\n   worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy\n   to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we\n   (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap\n   that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that\n   it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather\n   than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!\n\nOf course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend\non revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the\nlifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!\n\nWhat’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?\nAs we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few\nitems that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as\nan insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several\nmonths now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta\nrelease.\n\n * More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and\n   installation process.\n * Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.\n * Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.\n\nOnce these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open\nBeta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will\ngo live.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and\nstrongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and\nsuccess of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major\nplay towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The\nbenefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further\nthan simply being helpful for the Particl community.\n\nAs such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post,\nbut we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the\ninfamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?\n\nSo, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update\neither in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development\nprogress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem.

Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        </br>\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, /glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            </p><li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        <p></p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            </p><li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

is live! Built and\ndesigned from the ground up by the team, it’s a massive improvement over the\nprevious website.

A world of\nopportunities awaits you!Particl.io - Apps that respect your rights\n[https://particl.io/]Why a New Website?\nParticl is a mission-driven project with strong convictions. It is supported by\nincredibly talented developers who’ve built a unique and innovative\ndecentralized platform that finally shifts the balance of power back into the\nhands of the people, not greedy corporations. The implications of that are huge\nand it has the potential to change a lot of aspects of our lives.\n\nBut somehow, the now-previous website didn’t fully do full justice to the\nproject's mission and intentions. Although it detailed the project’s unique\ntechnical points (and they sure are impressive), it was easy for new, curious\npeople to miss the bigger picture that ties everything together. That made it\nmore challenging to turn these interested people into new users and fans of the\nproject and limited the impact of any marketing, PR, or outreach effort.\n\nThat's why Particl needed a new website, especially now with the release of\nParticl V3 which pushes the project into a new phase where outreach will be more\nprevalent.\n\nThe Objectives Behind it\nThe website has been built with two simple but clear objectives in mind.\n\n- Showcase Particl’s products and their benefits\n\n- Tell Particl’s story and its mission.\n\nBuilding the website according to these two objectives ensures that the big\npicture becomes apparent and that people understand the purpose of the project,\nwhat it's working to achieve, and what they can get from it.\n\nAfter all, the official website is where new people land when they want to learn\nmore about a project. It’s what they use to make their first impression and\ndecide whether they want to dig deeper or skip the project out of a lack of\ninterest. And with so many projects to look at nowadays and the sheer number of\ndistractions screaming for attention, you have to transmit your message as\nclearly and concisely as possible if you want people to stick around and be\ninterested in digging deeper.\n\nA Website in Expansion\nParticl’s new website is expected to continue expanding and evolving as we move\nforward in time, especially as the upcoming Particl DEX (BasicSwap) soon enters\nits open beta phase. You can track its progress by following the Particl.io\nrepository [https://github.com/particl/particl.io] on Github.\n\nThe Cornerstone of All Upcoming Marketing Efforts\nThe website is where most marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns redirect people\nto. It has to be able to convert curious or interested people into new users of\nfans of the project. After all, that's where these people will be forming their\nfirst impression on the project.\n\nFor this reason, it’s easy to understand why the website is the cornerstone of\nmarketing. It is the key to capitalizing on successful initiatives and turning\npotentially interested people into real users and supporters.\n\nTo that effect, we've published, last week, the team's vision and short to\nmid-term plans for marketing here on Particl News.
