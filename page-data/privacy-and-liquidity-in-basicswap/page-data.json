If it wasn’t already the case, the crypto world\ntruly became a bona fide industry, complete with billion-dollar institutions,\nand fiduciary responsibility over trillions of dollars from its biggest\ncentralized players. Following this new landscape, as the night to day, came the\ninterest of regulators and government bodies. Unfortunately, much of it is still\nto come.\n\nFor this reason and others, a lot of people enamored by cryptocurrency’s initial\npromises — an uncompromising, radically privacy-focused marriage between the\ninternet and mediums of exchange — have found themselves compelled to retreat\nfrom nearly all currently existing centralized crypto asset platforms. \n\nWhat we now call “privacy coins” began to show themselves as one of the only\nlegal shelters to existing and looming regulations (the ‘privacy’ distinction\nhere is even ironic, as it is clear as day that “a peer-to-peer electronic cash\nsystem” would need to confine itself to the decisions of two peers and two peers\nonly, with no inherent access or need for third parties to meddle with the\ndecisions of those two peers). This, of course, is only half the battle: where \nand how those privacy coins are to be traded is also at issue.\n\n\nRegulation and Privacy-Preserving Assets\nMonero, Dash, Particl, Firo and other privacy coins are spearheading many\ntechnologies in the ever-evolving domain of cryptic currency. With them,\nanonymous transactions, at least to people that understand the initial vision,\nestablished themselves as a necessary component of Satoshi’s famous whitepaper.\nAnd by extension, privacy-focused decentralized exchanges also revealed\nthemselves as necessary for said transactional privacy to take on any meaningful\nform.\n\nTrading exchanges, where most of the liquidity lies, are increasingly being\naffected by government regulations, transforming them to become highly regulated\nmen-in-the-middle of most trades. This is obviously anathema to the original\ncypherpunk vision of privacy coins and cryptocurrency in general — still, to\nthis day, most privacy coins are traded on centralized exchanges. \n\nThis is a fatal compromise on the very concept of private currencies, and a\ncritical obstacle for privacy technologies; but it is a reality that projects\nmust nonetheless navigate through, in compliance. \n\nThe question of liquidity is also to consider within this kind of hyper-private,\ndecentralized ethos. Well-populated, centralized exchanges and order books are\nthe norm, and for a long time were considered necessary for mass adoption. This,\nof course, lent itself to disasters, such as the FTX debacle\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-collapse-explained]\n, the BTC-e shutdown\n[https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged]\n, the BitFinex hack\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitfinex-hacked-hongkong-idUSKCN10E0KP], and\nothers. Most cryptocurrency users came to understand this the hard way: although\ndecentralized exchange adoption is still lacking, it seems “holding your own\nkeys” is now more ingrained into the crypto psyche than it ever was.\n\nHyper-privacy and the AMM Model\nAnother noteworthy, but often overlooked, compromise on total privacy and\nresilience is the current (some say, inherent) state of automated market makers,\nor AMMs. AMMs are essential to the vast majority of currently existing DEX\nexchanges and bring us one step closer to leaving custodial solutions behind for\ngood. However, they are not without flaws: impermanent losses and associated\nfees are commonly cited, but AMM-based models actually have to contend with many\npotential vulnerabilities, with regard to both security and privacy.\n\nFrom a security perspective, smart contracts and the complex collaborations\nbetween them can, of course, lead to potential protocol vulnerabilities. BSX, by\ndesign, opts for “lower-level” alternatives to smart contracts deemed safer,\nsuch as scriptless scripts and adaptor signatures\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_technicals.html].\nOn the other hand, AMM liquidity pools often make heavy use of smart contracts,\nwhich have in the past made them targets of malicious attacks such as \nreentrancy\nattacks [https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack], among many\nothers. Reentrancy attacks occur when a trusted smart contract makes an external\ncall to a separate, untrusted smart contract, in order to exploit a potential\nbug in the code which would allow it to drain or manipulate smart contract\nassets. This can have devastating effects on targeted liquidity pools, and by\nextension to AMM liquidity providers - the Siren protocol, which was victim of\nsuch a hack in 2021\n[https://halborn.com/explained-the-siren-protocol-hack-september-2021/] to the\ntune of $3.5 million dollars, is merely one example out of many.\n\nOther security contingencies that AMM liquidity providers have to contend with\ninclude oracle attacks\n[https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217]\n, block timestamp manipulation\n[https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack], and the\ninfamous rug pulls that have become far too common. The semi-centralized aspects\nof AMMs, especially AMMs powered by in-house tokens such as Sushiswap or\nPancakeSwap, also amount to a security flaw in some respects, as the only way to\nensure that liquidity providers on AMMs are consistently profitable is often by\ncounteracting losses with heavy, hyper-inflationary financial incentives in the\nform of newly created native tokens.\n\nPotential privacy vulnerabilities within AMM models are also to be considered.\nIt is absolutely necessary for the BSX protocol to be entirely impervious to\nblockchain analysis and identity tracing to safeguard the personal safety of its\nusers — especially when swapping directly with unknown parties — which is a\npotential liability that most AMM-based DEXs, even ones that rely on standard\natomic swaps, have to contend with. \n\nTo that end, BSX employs adaptor signatures\n[https://github.com/ElementsProject/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md] \nto allow for completely hidden atomic swaps, without any sort of matching hashes\non participating blockchains, thus preventing any sort of analysis or\nlinkability of transactions over time. In combination with that, BasicSwap’s\ntype of order book, where one can pick and choose offers instead of having to\nfollow bid and ask curves, provides a user experience that is similar to that of\ncentralized exchanges but ensures total obfuscation of what is being traded and\nwhen. This ensures that the protocol is highly resilient against analysis,\nincluding identity tracing and behavioral model inference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that “DEX” exchanges that are confined to one chain, or\nits clones (via “bridges”), also come with their own fatal compromises on\nabsolute privacy and security, as exemplified by critical vulnerabilities\n[https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all] \ndiscovered in November of last year.\n\nCommunity Liquidity with BasicSwap\nThe above considerations and the harsh reality of difficult and complex\nregulations which projects must navigate through, in compliance, weigh heavily\nin the protocol design of BasicSwap, especially with regard to encouraging\nliquidity within the network without sacrificing security or privacy. \n\nBasicSwap, a free and completely cross-chain decentralized trading protocol\nusing a novel implementation of atomic swap-based trading and the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], is\nmeant as a zero-compromise alternative for private peer-to-peer trades - that\nmeans a lot of liquidity solutions available for other decentralized exchanges,\neven ones with an eye for privacy, are rejected by BasicSwap as privacy\ncompromises on one level or another. Providing liquidity responsibly and safely\nhas traditionally been one of the bigger challenges for trustless exchanges\nbetween peers, and while solutions do exist and will no doubt continue to be\nbuilt and improved upon, they must ultimately satisfy a strict list of criteria\nin order to fit with the end goal of the BasicSwap protocol.\n\nTo this end, BSX also opted for an entirely user-supported and distributed\norderbook-like format for trades, similar to what is typically seen on\ncentralized trading exchanges, minus the centralized, intermediated aspects.\nThis hardline, no-compromise approach is by design; whenever you trade Monero,\nParticl, PIVX, Dash, or other coins on BSX, not only do you help yourself by\nbecoming more resilient against the possible threats that centralized exchanges\nand AMM DEX solutions bring, but you also do your part in improving the\nblockchain’s resilience against privacy-targeting attacks of all kinds. Simply\nby deciding to trade your crypto on such an exchange, you make privacy coins and\ntheir ecosystems more private and more unstoppable, by leaving no trace behind.\n\nThat is why we invite you, if you care about privacy as we do, to spread the\nword about BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html] \nand the existential issues that centralized and AMM DEX solutions bring to\nuncompromising privacy and security. It is free to use, open source, does not\nrely on native tokens, and involves absolutely no KYC or account requirements —\nthis arrangement offers only advantages for both you and the networks of the\ncoins you’re trading.\n\nEvery little bit helps, and we can all be a big part of this fight for our\nfreedoms and privacy.

Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've made great strides this week in finishing off the last remaining tasks\nbefore we can launch Particl Desktop 3.3 to mainnet. \n\nAs of now, only the CSV transaction data export feature is left to complete, and\nwe anticipate that it will be ready by the end of the weekend or early in the\nupcoming week.\n\nOnce that's taken care of, we'll commence the mainnet release process, which\nshould only take a few days. As such, we anticipate Particl Desktop 3.3 to go\nlive on mainnet as soon as next week. Then, we'll move on to working on the\nseller app we talked about last week.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ✅\nAs a reminder, here's an excerpt from last week's update which outlines the\nnature and planned features of the marketplace seller application which we'll\nstart working on right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3 on mainnet.\n\n> The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle.\n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase.\n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules.

Indeed, we anticipate that\nthe GUI version 2.0 will be completed by next week and will include the\nfollowing improvements:\n\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a new price charting system, including volumes.\n * New, improved user interface codebase.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n> Note: We're requiring additional time to wrap up the simple mode. For that\nreason, it won't be included in next week's GUI update, but should be ready\nshortly thereafter.\nVideo Tutorials ?️\nWe've started rolling out a series of BasicSwap tutorial videos on Particl's\nYoutube channel.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
