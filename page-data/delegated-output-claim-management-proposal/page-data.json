This shift aims at putting you, every\ncommunity member, into a more important position of power over what happens with\nthe project.\n\nAs such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing\nhow the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain\nvoting tool and the CCS proposal system.\n\nThe on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the\nblockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on\nthe CCS.\n\nIf you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the\nParticl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on\nby the community.\n\nFor all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in\nwith the CCS system, check out this blog post available on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/].\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]To\nempower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance\nmodel, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model\nthat could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.\n\nThis decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in\nthe coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to\n8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other\n50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.\n\nThe Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft\nproposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit\nthe Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the\ntreasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the\non-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.\n\nIn May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post\nexplaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds\nfrom the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose,\nand so on. Keep your eyes peeled on Particl News for when that blog post lands.\n\nFirst Proposal to Require a Vote Now Live on the CCS\nDelegated Output Claim Management by cryptoguard · Pull Request #7 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal is to implement a streamlined and\nmore\nefficient way to process manual output claims and reactivate temporarily\ndisabled anon and blind balances.RationaleOn the 25th of Febr...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7]April also saw the first CCS\nproposal ever to require an on-chain community vote to be activated. Indeed,\ncreated out of firm community feedback, the Delegated Output Claim Management\nProposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7] suggests nominating a\ngroup composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate\nindividual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. \n\nOnce validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one\ncomposed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This\nsecond group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no\nclaim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.\n\nIt seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire\nmethod to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon\nthe assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.\n\nThis proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for\nvoting in the next few days.

This shift aims at putting you, every community member, into a more important position of power over what happens with the project.</p><p>As such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing how the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain voting tool and the CCS proposal system.</p><p>The on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the blockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on the CCS.</p><p>If you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the Particl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on by the community.</p><p>For all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in with the CCS system, check out <a href=\"https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/\"><strong>this blog post available on Particl News</strong></a>.</p><h1 id=\"decentralized-treasury-model\">Decentralized Treasury Model</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about the new CCS proposal to form a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Blog</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/d61e2b944bf46e43f071527ffeff4776/medium-particl-treasury.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>To empower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance model, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model that could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.</p><p>This decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in the coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to 8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other 50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.</p><p>The Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft proposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the treasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the on-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.</p><p>In May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post explaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds from the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose, and so on.

Indeed, created out of firm community feedback, the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7\">Delegated Output Claim Management Proposal</a> suggests nominating a group composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate individual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. </p><p>Once validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one composed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This second group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no claim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.</p><p>It seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire method to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon the assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.</p><p>This proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for voting in the next few days. If you have any questions or comments, you can visit the AMA/FAQ thread dedicated to this proposal on Reddit by following <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/n0ld5d/amafaq_delegated_output_claim_management_proposal/\">this link</a>.</p><h1 id=\"particl-v3-progress-report\">Particl V3 Progress Report</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/new-particl-releases-and-v3-progress-report/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">New Particl Releases and V3 Progress Report</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Download and install the new Particl Desktop and Core releases and get up to speed with the latest Particl V3 progress report.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Blog</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/ce2ecbcc86289adccb5752b361200b65/medium-particl-dev-project-update-and-v3-progress-report.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>As Particl V3 nears completion for its mainnet release, a development progress report has been published during April.

Not only will it provide more resilience against the power exchanges hold over Particl, but it’ll also make acquiring PART easier, more accessible, and entirely anonymous. An integration of BasicSwap into Particl Desktop is planned and is currently in progress (more details on that in a later Particl News blog post).</p><p>As development continues, BasicSwap will soon be opened for testing as a public beta. Stay vigilant as it will be announced on Particl News when ready.</p><hr><p>Get prepared for May as things are about to lift for Particl. You can expect the voting periods for two major proposals to go live, which will mark a new phase for the Particl project, one more focused on community governance and decentralization.</p><p>Things are about to get exciting and move forward at a much faster pace than the past few months.

chatter in the\ncommunity chatrooms as of late, then you probably already know by now that\nParticl is transitioning into an exciting new phase.\n\nIndeed, we have already announced that, in the days to come, there would be two\nmajor proposals published on the CCS that require community consensus to be set\nin motion. These are the output claim management proposal and the one to enable\na brand new, powerful treasury model.\n\nThat’s directly in line with our recent efforts to put more focus on community\ngovernance and improve the degree of decentralization of the project. This now\nputs you in a much more influential position.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to reveal all the details and parameters of this on-chain\nand entirely decentralized voting mechanism.\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * CCS Proposals\n * On-Chain Voting\n * Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n   [/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus]\n * Potential Voting Outcomes\n * Proposal Lifecycle\n * Community Fund\n * First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCCS Proposals\nAs explained, in detail, in the introductory blog post of the CCS\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982/], anyone\ncan submit proposals on the CCS to request donations for initiatives from the\ncommunity. The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level\nof decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain\nvoting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that\nmission.\n\nOn-Chain Voting\nThe on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can\nnow use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network\nvote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for\nproposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can\nbe used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!\n\nThe voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote\nevery time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a\nstake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from\naffecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their\ncoins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the\nsame time.\n\nThe main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting\nsystem that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With\nthis system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on\nthe blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without\nany risk of tampering.\n\nIt's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of\nall the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins\na pool contains, the more voting power it has.\n\n> Note: For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within\nthe voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (< 1,000 PART), it is\nlikely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.\nApproval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n\nFor a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three\nrequirements to fill. They are the quorum requirement, the approval rate, and\nthe minimum duration of the voting process. The quorum requirement is determined\nby what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The\napproval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a\nproposal.\n\nProposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each\none with its own value requirements.\n\nNon Protocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 60% in favor\n * Duration: 5,040 blocks minimum\n\nNon protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in\nthe protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from\nthe Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular\ninitiative.\n\nFor a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must\nbe a minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). Within that period, 20% of the\nblocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That\nmeans the quorum has to be at least 20%. Finally, to be considered as approved\nby the community, it needs to reach an approval rate of at least 60%, meaning at\nleast 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed\nidea.\n\nProtocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 75% in favor\n * Duration: 10,080 blocks minimum\n\nProtocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more\nsignificant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a\nspecific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a\ndecentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain,\nintroducing a new privacy technology, etc.\n\nJust like non protocol consensus votes, their quorum requirement stands at 20%.\nBut because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they\nrequire a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required \napproval rate has to be at least 75%. Finally, the duration of any protocol\nconsensus vote has to be a minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks) to give\nample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.\n\nPotential Voting Outcomes\nThere are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their\nrespective outcome.\n\n * If quorum is not met, the proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the\n   proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the\n   proposal is APPROVED ✅\n * If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target\n   approval rate, the proposal expires and is REJECTED ❌\n\nProposal Lifecycle\nBelow is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require\na vote.\n\n * A proposal is submitted on the CCS. Click here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/] to see how to submit your own proposal.\n * The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a\n   vote or not.\n * The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.\n * Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting\n   does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in\n   response to community feedback.\n * If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on\n   the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator\n   may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly\n   viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS\n   administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the\n   proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting\n   on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes\n   voting on the proposal.\n * The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then\n   assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).\n * The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the\n   administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.\n * When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected.\n   This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.\n * When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin.\n   The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the\n   milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.\n\nCommunity Fund\nInsightParticl Insight. View detailed information on all particl transactions\nand blocks.\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM]If you\nhave a great project or business you wish to build on Particl, or if there’s a\nservice you want to provide to the ecosystem, you may require funds to make it\nhappen. Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that\nfunding was through community donations.\n\nWith the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the \nCommunity Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM] to help\nyou realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART\nholders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.\n\nIndeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is\ngoing to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is\ncraft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in\ndetail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl\ncommunity to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.\n\nFirst Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!\nYou won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this \nWednesday (28th of April, 2021), we will publish the first-ever proposal to\nrequire the use of the on-chain voting system.\n\nThis proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate\nthe Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze\nall legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of\nthe emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be\nre-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS\non Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few\nproposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the\npower of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project,\nbusiness, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have\nall the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!\n\nThis addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and\nshould lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t\nforget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community\nFund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will\ngrow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous\npotential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with\nthese resources!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level of decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain voting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that mission.</p><h1 id=\"on-chain-voting\">On-Chain Voting</h1><p>The on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can now use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network vote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for proposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can be used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!</p><p>The voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote every time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a stake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from affecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their coins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the same time.</p><p>The main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting system that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With this system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on the blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without any risk of tampering.</p><p>It's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of all the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins a pool contains, the more voting power it has.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within the voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (&lt; 1,000 PART), it is likely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus\">Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus</h1><p><br>For a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three requirements to fill. They are the <strong>quorum requirement</strong>, the <strong>approval rate</strong>, and the <strong>minimum duration of the voting process</strong>. The quorum requirement is determined by what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The approval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a proposal.</p><p>Proposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each one with its own value requirements.</p><h3 id=\"non-protocol-consensus-votes\">Non Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> &gt;= 60% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 5,040 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Non protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in the protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from the Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular initiative.</p><p>For a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must be a <strong>minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). </strong>Within that period, 20% of the blocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That means <strong>the quorum has to be at least 20%</strong>. Finally, to be considered as approved by the community, it needs to reach an <strong>approval rate of at least 60%</strong>, meaning at least 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed idea.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-consensus-votes\">Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> &gt;= 75% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10,080 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Protocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more significant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a specific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a decentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain, introducing a new privacy technology, etc.</p><p>Just like non protocol consensus votes, their <strong>quorum requirement stands at 20%</strong>. But because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they require a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required <strong>approval rate has to be at least 75%</strong>. Finally, the duration of any protocol consensus vote has to be a <strong>minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks)</strong> to give ample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.</p><h1 id=\"potential-voting-outcomes\">Potential Voting Outcomes</h1><p>There are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their respective outcome.</p><ul><li>If quorum is not met, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the proposal is <strong>APPROVED </strong>✅</li><li>If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target approval rate, the proposal expires and is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li></ul><h1 id=\"proposal-lifecycle\">Proposal Lifecycle</h1><p>Below is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require a vote.</p><ul><li>A proposal is submitted on the CCS. <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/\"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to see how to submit your own proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a vote or not.</li><li>The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.</li><li>Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in response to community feedback.</li><li>If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes voting on the proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).</li><li>The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.</li><li>When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected. This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.</li><li>When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin. The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.</li></ul><h2 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Insight</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Insight.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
