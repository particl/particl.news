So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've finally completed most of the back-end work required to separate Particl\nCore and Desktop. We'd like to implement a couple of extra minor items, such as\nlogging outputs from the front end to the Particl Desktop log file, but we will\nprioritize other more pressing deliverables first. In any case, we expect it to\nbe pretty simple and straightforward to implement when needed.\n\nFor now, we're in the process of re-evaluating some changes on the front end to\nintegrate these new changes neatly in a user-friendly way. Although that is not\nexpected to be a challenging task, it is relatively tedious as we now need to\nremove a wide variety of long-standing implementations to the GUI that we've\ncarried for several desktop versions. That means updating everything that\ndepends on those changes and then potentially updating any code that depends on\nthat functionality, and so on.\n\nSo, generally speaking, everything is continuing along and seeing steady\nprogress. We have reached a new milestone in the development process of Particl\nDesktop 3.3, and the remaining body of work mainly relates to the front end.

You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nParticl Core 24.0 ?\nWe have split Particl Core into a new branch in preparation for the release of\nParticl Core 24.0. At this point, we are keeping on track with the Bitcoin\nupdates and are waiting for Bitcoin's release of Bitcoin 24.0 and its subsequent\ntesting before releasing it on our end. \n\nOnce Particl Core 24.0 is out on mainnet, we expect to diverge our primary\ncore-related focus into furthering the research and development for the\nlong-awaited SMSG 2.0 P2P network.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAs has been the case for the past few weeks, we've been wrapping up the GUI for\nBasicSwap. And although the final pieces have taken slightly longer than\nexpected to complete, we are an inch away from the finalization of the user\ninterface and, at the same time, the beginning of the open beta. \n\nMajor Particl Academy Update ?️\nWith the release of BasicSwap in mind, we've been overhauling the Particl\nAcademy to make place for documentation on the DEX. We've also refreshed its\ncontent and reorganized the information it contains.\n\nAll these changes make up for a relatively significant update, and we're happy\nto release the academy's new version next week!\n\nFollowing its release, we'll move on to refresh and improve several platforms\nand communications channels. These are as follows:\n\n * Standalone BasicSwap website\n * Refresh to Particl.io [https://particl.io]\n * Release of Particl's new all-in-one whitepaper\n\nThese updates will ensure that it remains as easy as possible to learn more\nabout BasicSwap and the Particl ecosystem within the context of the \nnewly-announced modular and open approach\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
