Again,\nchoosing to participate in this cause is 100% optional.\n\nParticl Foundation Match\nThe Particl Foundation would like to match all donations to a 20% rate with an\naggregate limit of 40,000 PART. In layman’s terms, if the donations for this\ncause reach 200,000 PART, the Particl Foundation will match with a maximum\ndonation of 40,000 PART.

The team\nrequested trading to halt at the end of the exchange to allow token holders a\nchance to participate in PART. Trading on SDC continued through the funding\nperiod and held its 60-day median value until April 19th 00:00 UTC when it\nplunged in value due to delisting requirements. This timestamp artificially\ncreated a break in the cost of entry to PART.\n\nHow did you come up with the 2:1 ratio?\nSDC held it’s value at $1.50 to $1.70 throughout the token exchange time frame.\nParticipants who exchanged during the 4 week window could exchange 1:1 which\nheld the market price value or exchange at 1:1.15 (15% bonus) which was below\nmarket price value in the 1st half of the 4 weeks and over $2 per PART in the\n2nd half of the 4 weeks. In order to protect our seed investor’s portfolio, a\nvalue of $3 per PART or 2:1 has been determined.","html":"<p><strong>This is an important blog post and we encourage everyone to share immediately wherever you can.</strong></p><p>The messages began to reach us soon after the April 15th deadline.

In your dashboard, SDC REQUIRED balance is 0.00000000\n 2. In your dashboard, BTC REQUIRED balance is 0.00000000\n 3. You’ve successfully confirmed your email address\n 4.

We have begun discussions with all exchanges that have\nSDC services. Since this isn’t a traditional coinswap all SDC coins on exchanges\nwill need to be transferred off the exchange and into PART or they will be lost\nforever. Remember, the Particl token exchange offers an exclusive first right of\nrefusal to current SDC token holders to get PART. Once the 4 week exchange\nperiod wraps up any SDC tokens left behind on exchanges or in personal wallets\nwill void the PART exchange offer.\n\nGroup 2 next steps:\n\nWe strongly encourage SDC token holders interested in getting PART tokens to\nbegin moving coins off the exchanges and into the Particl token exchange\n[https://particl.io/].
