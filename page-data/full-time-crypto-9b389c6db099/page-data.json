I think my quota was make 1 BTC/day\ntrading — do that and we were good to go! Still in my late-thirties at the time,\ncalling it a retirement sounded great (to me) but I didn’t want the raised\neyebrows all my old college roommates would surely give at our family parties.\n\nSo I improvised.\n\nI mean, who was I to spoil their joy of being neck deep in parenthood? Raising\nchildren, going to ball practices every night, eating McDonald’s in the car\nevery meal. Spending 40+ hours a week away from the ones you loved shouldn’t be\ninterrupted by such nonsense as retiring 15 years after just getting started.\n\nEssentially it was a sabbatical from my “real job” as a healthcare design\narchitect. The career path I unwittingly signed on for as a toddler building\nwith LEGOs, refined in high-school designing cars and lost days of sleep over in\ncollege. “Living the American Dream” of paying into 5–10 years of debt and then\ntrudging through nearly 50 years of service for someone not named “Mr. ME”.\n\nOh glory days!\n\n”I’m in this for the Blockchain”\nI was still playing family man and day trading cryptocurrencies in 2014 when I\ndecided to return to my architecture firm. There really isn’t anything better\nthan having freedom to spend the majority of your day with the people most\nimportant in your life.\n\nMy decision to return to a real job wasn’t as much a necessity as it was a\nstrategic move. Financially we were good, but I had 2 reasons to jump back in.\n\nFirst, frankly, I was bored\n[https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-bore-traders/]. I missed doing design\nand I wasn’t really participating in the communities of any of the coins I was\nholding. When you aren’t involved in a hobby you say you’re passionate about you\nquickly lose interest. Its the Curse of the Entrepreneur\n[http://www.aplacebetween.com/practical/entrepreneurs-curse.html]; lacking focus\nand chasing ideas.\n\nThere weren’t hours of crypto webcasts that popped up daily in my feed to keep\nme entertained, only Bitcointalk.org which was good for a couple train wreck \nsightings [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=857670.0] a week.\n\nLooking back at this time, I can see the tight bond of community, value and\ntechnology. We like to shill our favorite coin’s “first to” and “best at”\ntechnology but most users still don’t understand it all and deep down they only\nwant more people to talk about their project so the price goes up.\n\n> \nSecond, Bitcoin was in a remarkably stable price state and it was telling me it\nis time to accumulate (hence we needed capital), as news was beginning to\nsurround the distributed ledger 1/2 of Satoshi’s invention; the “blockchain”.\n\nI had already begun focusing on privacy coins before returning to the 9–5 with\nnew projects like Darkcoin and Monero beginning development. But I really\ngravitated to projects that were bringing utility into the crypto space. I\ndidn’t sign up to Bitcoin for merely another way to move money on the internet\nfrom one exchange to another, I signed up for a better this ?\n\n> Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial\ninstitutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.\nWhile the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from\nthe inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. — “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer\nElectronic Cash System” — Satoshi Nakamoto\nTo me this speaks to the power of the blockchain. The ability to create\ntrustless models for social platforms, exchanges, marketplaces, storage and even\noracles. These projects were moving past the coin and building in utility, just\nlike the quote above taken from the first line of the Bitcoin Whitepaper \nintroduction [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf].\n\nThis ultimately led me to the Shadow Project which had already developed a\nprivacy currency, ShadowCash SDC, but was now building in some utility with a\ndecentralized marketplace. To me, this was the next step for crypto; creating a \ndecentralized, anonymous economy!\n\nAround this time I finally began volunteering for the first time, wherever I\ncould help within the SDC community. It may have taken me a while to figure this\nout but, I had skills from real life that could actually help a team of\nvolunteers working on an open-source project that I also believed in and\ninvested in.\n\n“Get off your ass and do something!”\nIf you have one of these posters plastered on you’re wall or screen you need\nslapped upside ya head!This ain’t a religion\n[https://hackernoon.com/is-crypto-like-a-religion-6-other-crypto-thoughts-c12a1e7f0453]\n, it’s a revolution! A revolution is led by people not a person.\n\nICOs were around before 2017, but this year we saw ridiculously-funded teams\nbegin to pour into the space. Before 2017 nearly all projects were being\ndeveloped by a handful of volunteer developers, had zero marketing presence and\nwere reliant on community volunteers to create the news. In fact, many of these\nolder projects still rely 100% on volunteers.\n\nI began helping more and more within Shadow and got excited feeling like I was\nmaking a difference rather than piggybacking on everyone else’s hard work. I’d\nlike to think the content I was creating was educating people and helping the\nprice, which also helps with adoption.\n\nAs 2016 was coming to a close, I was in line with everyone else waiting for a\nprivate, anonymous, decentralized marketplace to spend and earn my coins. I had\nmoved most of my holdings into projects trying to make a difference, not just\nforking for a niche currency. And my own project I gave most of my free time to\nwas on the brink of a major pivot.\n\nI was invited to help.\n\n“I’m in this for the Platform”\nThe need for change was harder to see between the green and red candles on\nPoloniex or Bittrex.\n\nAfter all, the Shadow Project team was developing a top 30 cryptocurrency\nproject. They were focused on privacy. They realized merely maintaining a\ncurrency did nobody any good so they were going to build a decentralized\nmarketplace to give people a place to spend and earn their coins. They were\nbuilding a trustless economy powered by the blockchain.\n\nAnd people were starting to notice\n\nChart shows the 7 months leading up to the SDC/PART token exchange. Median\nprice ~$1.50> “You can’t build a great building on a weak foundation. You must\nhave a solid foundation if you’re going to have a strong\nsuperstructure.” — Gordon B. Hinckley\nThere were many factors pointing to an inevitable pivot away from Shadow and\ninto Particl, not the least of which was breaking the implied connection to any\nunderground, shady activity from the name. Darkcoin rebranded to Dash, Dogecoin\nDark rebranded to Verge, BitcoinDark rebranded to Komodo, etc..\n\nA rebrand is an easy transition, sometimes an overnight decision, right Jamie?!\nWhat the Shadow Project team was internally asking all of us to solve was how to\nproperly build this idea of a decentralized economy — privacy, marketplace,\nbuying, selling and earning (currency + utility) — on a secure foundation. To be\nbig and make a difference we would need a codebase that could be developed on,\nadded to and easily enhanced as new technological advances came about.\n\nYou see, SDC was built on Bitcoin 0.8 circa 2013\n[https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history], just like nearly every PoS project\nforked from Bitcoin. And the proper way to build this new trustless economy was\nto build a platform where pieces can be added by other dev teams, governance\nmechanisms can be applied and other cryptocurrencies can be allowed to interact\nwith.\n\nThere was no way in hell all of that was going to be easy to apply to an old\ncodebase. And good luck getting other development teams excited to build\nanything on top of it.\n\nWe decided to abandon the Shadow codebase, blockchain and history in order to\nbuild a more powerful privacy platform, built on the latest Bitcoin codebase;\nthe most hardened, secure and developed codebase in the space.\n\n“Stepping Up My Game”\nBelieve me when I tell you that all of us developing the Particl pivot plans had\nto swallow — force down in some cases — that pill. I’m sure it wasn’t a test\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT4j3xWtaoA] I had just passed, but during\nthese planning meetings I was asked to join the Particl transition team and head\nup Communications for the new project.\n\nAnd can you guess what my first official assignment was in the crypto space? To\nserve up a healthy dose of water for that pill everyone was going to be asked to\nswallow.\n\n> “Don’t limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can\ndo. You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can\nachieve.” — Mary Kay Ash\nThank you, I guess? Turns out it was one of the best decisions of my life!\n\nAnd I think the Particl team has done a damn fine job with our community’s\ngenerosity to build the first decentralized privacy platform that will welcome\ncryptocurrency users from other projects to participate in a cryptoagnostic,\nprivacy marketplace.\n\nParticl: 2017 Year In Review\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797]\nThank you to our developers, community and team!\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797]\n\n“Full-Time Crypto”\nIt’s now 2018 and for the better part of 1 year I’ve definitely NOT been\nsemi-retired.\n\n * I’ve been working 1 full-time job as a real life architect.\n * I’ve been working 1 part-time (30+ hrs/week) job as Head of Communications\n   for Particl.io\n * I still invest in blockchain projects that are creating freedom tools; \n   “convenient and untraceable, liberated from the oversight of governments and\n   banks” — Benjamin Wallace\n * And surprise, surprise, I play the resident “Bitcoin Guru” in my circle of\n   influence — although I’m sure that’s a commonality I share with many of you\n   readers.\n\nWe’ve had an explosive year of growth in Particl and entire cryptocurrency\nspace. Many of you are jumping into early retirement, changing your career path,\nenjoying financial freedom or even cutting ties (as much as possible) with fiat\nmonies forever.\n\nToday I’m proud to say I am also going full-time crypto! And this time I really\nmean it!\nI officially retired from my architecture practice to focus on Particl\nfull-time. I can focus on expanding our team, growing our community and being\nfamily man again. We have lots of growth to prepare for in our community and\namong other cryptocurrency projects as the Particl Marketplace gets released to\nthe public and other currency users have a private, trustless way to buy and\nsell with their own coins, without markups, censorship or unnecessary 3rd party\nfees.\n\nSummary\nI approached this article as an opportunity to share my insights as a\ncryptocurrency trader, bystander, volunteer and team leader. I’ve seen a\nlifetime of lessons and experiences in the short, 6+ years my eyes were opened\nto the realization that, a coin and a blockchain, could change the world.\n\nI love hearing stories of financial freedom, career changes to pursue passions\nand early retirement to spend more time with the people that mean the most.\nCrypto has brought all three to me and I’m excited about the work we’re doing at\nParticl. My day job just got 1000% cooler ?\n\nThis year we will see many trends (platform, atomic swaps, agnosticism, privacy,\ndecentralization) and I think Particl is positioned very well to contribute in\nall these areas for the common good of the entire space.\n\nRemember that there’s no substitute for doing your own research. It’s not all\nabout making money. We’re constantly getting closer to a more private,\ndecentralized future, and away from any and all reliance on fiat.\n\nThat will be the day!","html":"<h3 id=\"and-this-time-i-really-mean-it-\">And this time I really mean it!</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/-Full-Time-Crypto-/0--OIJumdYj3GJ9Sjn.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For nearly all of us in the cryptocurrency space uttering the words “full-time crypto” means something special.
