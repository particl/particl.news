Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've made great strides this week in finishing off the last remaining tasks\nbefore we can launch Particl Desktop 3.3 to mainnet. \n\nAs of now, only the CSV transaction data export feature is left to complete, and\nwe anticipate that it will be ready by the end of the weekend or early in the\nupcoming week.\n\nOnce that's taken care of, we'll commence the mainnet release process, which\nshould only take a few days. As such, we anticipate Particl Desktop 3.3 to go\nlive on mainnet as soon as next week. Then, we'll move on to working on the\nseller app we talked about last week.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ✅\nAs a reminder, here's an excerpt from last week's update which outlines the\nnature and planned features of the marketplace seller application which we'll\nstart working on right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3 on mainnet.\n\n> The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle.\n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase.\n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly\nconvenient, accessible, and much easier to use — Last Week's Update\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-27-01-2023/]\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has seen the continued development of our initial market making\ncompanion app for BasicSwap DEX and its updated user interface.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we are making continual progress in both\nareas, particularly concerning the user interface. Indeed, we anticipate that\nthe GUI version 2.0 will be completed by next week and will include the\nfollowing improvements:\n\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a new price charting system, including volumes.\n * New, improved user interface codebase.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n> Note: We're requiring additional time to wrap up the simple mode. For that\nreason, it won't be included in next week's GUI update, but should be ready\nshortly thereafter.\nVideo Tutorials ?️\nWe've started rolling out a series of BasicSwap tutorial videos on Particl's\nYoutube channel. These videos cover the basics of setting up BasicSwap, enabling\ncoins, and more, making the process of using the platform's open beta state much\neasier.\n\nAnd as we release Particl Desktop 3.3 live on mainnet in a few days, which will\nbe followed by an extensive evolutionary process, we'll also be publishing a\nsimilar series of videos highlighting its features and capabilities. \n\nAs we'll have much more content coming to the Particl Youtube channel, make sure\nto subscribe to our Youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/c/particl] so that\nyou don't miss anything!\n\n * Install BasicSwap on Windows 11 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEZ-a00uSM]\n * Update BasicSwap [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk3FtE_TKBQ]\n * Update Coins on BasicSwap [https://youtu.be/dURSmAtWE6A]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

You\ncan download and install it now and benefit from the most current and\nstreamlined Particl user experience available.\n\nThis is an important milestone for the desktop client and the project as a\nwhole, as it brings us one step closer to our goal of having a more modular and\nefficient ecosystem.\n\nWe'll delve deeper into this topic in this blog post, so let's get started!\n\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeparation of Particl Core and Desktop ?\nThe major takeaway from this update is the decoupling of the Particl blockchain\nfrom the desktop client.\n\nFrom the outset, Particl Desktop v1.0 was entirely linked with Particl Core.\nThat's because, at the time of its launch, the desktop client lacked the\nmarketplace dApp component and was purely designed as a cryptocurrency wallet.\nTo be more precise, the marketplace itself wasn't initially designed as a\nstandalone dApp, but rather an added set of functionalities to the Particl\nwallet.\n\nAs the years progressed, Particl's vision developed into a more ambitious goal,\nnecessitating an extensive transformation of the desktop client's unified\narchitecture into a more adaptive and flexible design.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 makes significant strides towards establishing an\nindependent relationship between Particl Core and the desktop client by\nseparating them entirely, allowing them to coexist and operate harmoniously as\ndistinct pieces of software.\n\nFirst Steps Towards Modularity ⚙️\nThe reasoning behind separating Particl Core and Desktop is the first step\ntowards a more modular, open, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It signals the\nbeginning of the client's transformation from a \"cryptocurrency wallet with\nextra features\" into a fully-fledged sandbox for privacy-first dApps. \n\nThis development is expected to take place through a series of incremental\nchanges all throughout the new development cycle, each update working towards\nachieving our objective of modularity, openness, and enhanced efficiency.\n\nTo learn more about Particl's new (and now current) development cycle, please\nrefer to this extensive blog post\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] on the topic.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]General Bug Fixes\nand Improvements ?\nAside from this significant leap forward, this new release introduces a wide\nvariety of improvements, both architecturally and to the user experience. It\nalso and a few bugs and issues. You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of\nthis article. \n\nSeller Companion App is Next ?\nNow that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion\napp begins. \n\nFor those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent\nweekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned\nfeatures for it.\n\n> The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. \n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase.\n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly\nconvenient, accessible, and much easier to use.\n * Source: Particl Development Progress Report (03-02-2023)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-03-02-2023/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.3.0 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop\nv3.3.0RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE\nVERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.3.023.0.30.3.121.8.0 CHANGELOG[overview] [Linux OS]\nApplication name ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0]For those\nunfamiliar with Particl, we highly recommend exploring the Particl Academy as an\ninformative guide and resource for using Particl Desktop and the Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nFor those interested, launching the application via the terminal offers\nreal-time log data.

It is not recommended to edit these by hand, but they can\n   be useful if something goes wrong and a setting is unavailable.\n * Completed a significant refactor to help move towards the goal of independent\n   apps/modules in the system (and/or independent blockchain networks).\n * Any attempt o download a new Particl Core binary or start a new binary now\n   occurs after the application has fully started, rather than blocking access\n   to the main application user interface until particl-core has been started.\n * Updated to use Particl Core v23\n\nParticl Core\n * Introduced a new module to allow for the configuration of when and how to\n   start the Particl Core binary/executable.\n * Particl Core will need to be correctly started and accessible in order to\n   access the apps/modules requiring Particl blockchain functionality.\n * Various Particl Core startup configuration options are presented in this\n   module, along with the ability to start or stop a Particl Core node (or\n   connect to an already running node).\n * Note that the settings per chain (mainnet/testnet/regtest) are stored\n   separately, and are updated whenever the chain being connected to is changed\n   (in the Startup menu option).\n * For advanced users, wanting to customize startup further: * the particl-core.json file in the settings directory/folder contains a\n      number of settings per chain (in addition to other settings).\n    * A params key can be placed into the JSON structure of the chain to be\n      configured; this params key should contain a value of an array/list of\n      strings, where each string is the CLI arg of the argument to pass to\n      particl core when starting it. These are not presented in the GUI, but\n      will be applied when attempting to start or connect to the configured\n      Particl chain.\n    * Any incorrect\n      values provided, or an invalid structure, or conflicting params can be\n      viewed in the appropriate log file.\n   \n   \n\nWallet Module\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Includes minor bug fixes and improvements.\n * Added the ability to export the wallet History to a CSV file.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction and address\n   lookup URLs * these are configured according to the Particl chain currently\n      running.\n   \n   \n\nMarketplace dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n * Added an indicator to the menu bar to indaicate when the current wallet is\n   locked and order updates may not be processed.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction URLs * these\n      are configured according to the Particl chain currently running.\n   \n   \n\nGovernance dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n\nDesktop Settings\n * Added the ability to view the Terms and Conditions (not possible previously\n   once they had been accepted after first starting the application).\n * Added the option to toggle whether PD does its own update checks (the URL\n   where updates are queried can be configured in the appropriate settings JSON\n   file: the format of the response needs to be specific, but a script is\n   available to generate and host this file elsewhere if so desired).\n * Included the ability to configure external domains that Particl Desktop can\n   open in the browser. * IMPORTANT! Particl Desktop attempts to prevent unknown external domains\n      from being navigated to, unless they are included in a permitted/allowed\n      list. Some URLs. such as the local machine, the Particl block explorer,\n      and Github, are by default added to this allowed/permitted list. Thus, if\n      any of the transaction or address lookup URLs in the particl wallet or\n      particl market app/modules are changed/customized, ensure that the\n      configured URL (or the domain name at minimum) is also added to this\n      permitted list. Not including the custom domain in the permitted/allowed\n      list will present a prompt indicating that the URL cannot be navigated to.\n   \n   \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.3 now available on mainnet, we're thrilled to finally\nbegin this new and exciting development cycle poised to significantly improve\nParticl in almost every aspects.\n\nIf you haven't done so already, we, once again, highly recommend reading this\narticle [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which\nextensively details our plans moving forward. \n\nWe are immensely grateful for all the enthusiasm, contributions, and support we\nhave received from the Particl community.

That's because, at the time of its launch, the desktop client lacked the marketplace dApp component and was purely designed as a cryptocurrency wallet. To be more precise, the marketplace itself wasn't initially designed as a standalone dApp, but rather an added set of functionalities to the Particl wallet.</p><p>As the years progressed, Particl's vision developed into a more ambitious goal, necessitating an extensive transformation of the desktop client's unified architecture into a more adaptive and flexible design.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.3 makes significant strides towards establishing an independent relationship between Particl Core and the desktop client by separating them entirely, allowing them to coexist and operate harmoniously as distinct pieces of software.</p><h2 id=\"first-steps-towards-modularity-\">First Steps Towards Modularity ⚙️</h2><p>The reasoning behind separating Particl Core and Desktop is the first step towards a more modular, open, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It signals the beginning of the client's transformation from a \"cryptocurrency wallet with extra features\" into a fully-fledged sandbox for privacy-first dApps. </p><p>This development is expected to take place through a series of incremental changes all throughout the new development cycle, each update working towards achieving our objective of modularity, openness, and enhanced efficiency.</p><p><strong>To learn more about Particl's new (and now current) development cycle, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">this extensive blog post</a> on the topic.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Particl’s Next Evolutionary Leap Forward</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn about the team’s new major development cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for the development and deployment of privacy-first dApps.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/ce0a0b9da50e8a06c5e5f552c168c510/Leap-Forward-Medium.jpg\"></div></a></figure><h2 id=\"general-bug-fixes-and-improvements-\">General Bug Fixes and Improvements ?</h2><p>Aside from this significant leap forward, this new release introduces a wide variety of improvements, both architecturally and to the user experience. It also and a few bugs and issues. You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of this article. </p><h2 id=\"seller-companion-app-is-next-\">Seller Companion App is Next ?</h2><p>Now that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion app begins. </p><p>For those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent weekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned features for it.</p><blockquote><em>The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored for Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and publish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and chats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the auto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of orders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more efficient and effortless.<br><br>The application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to external platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of functionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of manually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with automated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling stuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms they do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of listings available on the marketplace!<br><br>The app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in the direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, <strong>especially when paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. </strong><br><br>In reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of Particl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect with other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.<br><br>Although this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision, it is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress through this infrastructural evolutionary phase.<br><br>We aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by integrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its components into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly convenient, accessible, and much easier to use.</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-03-02-2023/\">Particl Development Progress Report (03-02-2023)</a></li></ul><hr><h1 id=\"get-started\">Get Started</h1><ul><li><strong>Download Particl Desktop 3.3: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0</a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Release Particl Desktop v3.3.0 · particl/particl-desktop</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Desktop v3.3.0RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.3.023.0.30.3.121.8.0 CHANGELOG[overview] [Linux OS] Application name ...</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">GitHub</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">particl</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/87973da3f7073618e395ed124d0011477713ef14e46ab261769a4100db957c0d/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\"></div></a></figure><p>For those unfamiliar with Particl, we highly recommend exploring the Particl Academy as an informative guide and resource for using Particl Desktop and the Particl Marketplace.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a class=\"btn\" href=\"https://academy.particl.io\" target=\"_blank\">Open Particl Academy</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"notes\"><strong>Notes</strong></h1><ul><li><strong>Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the marketplace.</strong></li><li>If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Github Issues</a> page.</li></ul><h1 id=\"advanced-start-up\"><strong>Advanced Start-up</strong></h1><p>For those interested, launching the application via the terminal offers real-time log data.

You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of this article. </p><h2 id=\"seller-companion-app-is-next-\">Seller Companion App is Next ?</h2><p>Now that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion app begins. </p><p>For those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent weekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned features for it.</p><blockquote><em>The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored for Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and publish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and chats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the auto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of orders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more efficient and effortless.<br><br>The application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to external platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of functionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of manually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with automated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling stuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms they do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of listings available on the marketplace!<br><br>The app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in the direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, <strong>especially when paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. </strong><br><br>In reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of Particl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect with other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.<br><br>Although this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision, it is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress through this infrastructural evolutionary phase.<br><br>We aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by integrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its components into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly convenient, accessible, and much easier to use.</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-03-02-2023/\">Particl Development Progress Report (03-02-2023)</a></li></ul><hr><h1 id=\"get-started\">Get Started</h1><ul><li><strong>Download Particl Desktop 3.3: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0</a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Release Particl Desktop v3.3.0 · particl/particl-desktop</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Desktop v3.3.0RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.3.023.0.30.3.121.8.0 CHANGELOG[overview] [Linux OS] Application name ...</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">GitHub</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">particl</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/87973da3f7073618e395ed124d0011477713ef14e46ab261769a4100db957c0d/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\"></div></a></figure><p>For those unfamiliar with Particl, we highly recommend exploring the Particl Academy as an informative guide and resource for using Particl Desktop and the Particl Marketplace.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a class=\"btn\" href=\"https://academy.particl.io\" target=\"_blank\">Open Particl Academy</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"notes\"><strong>Notes</strong></h1><ul><li><strong>Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the marketplace.</strong></li><li>If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Github Issues</a> page.</li></ul><h1 id=\"advanced-start-up\"><strong>Advanced Start-up</strong></h1><p>For those interested, launching the application via the terminal offers real-time log data.

also due to institutional investments chasing this\nrising cryptocurrency trend. If it wasn’t already the case, the crypto world\ntruly became a bona fide industry, complete with billion-dollar institutions,\nand fiduciary responsibility over trillions of dollars from its biggest\ncentralized players. Following this new landscape, as the night to day, came the\ninterest of regulators and government bodies. Unfortunately, much of it is still\nto come.\n\nFor this reason and others, a lot of people enamored by cryptocurrency’s initial\npromises — an uncompromising, radically privacy-focused marriage between the\ninternet and mediums of exchange — have found themselves compelled to retreat\nfrom nearly all currently existing centralized crypto asset platforms. \n\nWhat we now call “privacy coins” began to show themselves as one of the only\nlegal shelters to existing and looming regulations (the ‘privacy’ distinction\nhere is even ironic, as it is clear as day that “a peer-to-peer electronic cash\nsystem” would need to confine itself to the decisions of two peers and two peers\nonly, with no inherent access or need for third parties to meddle with the\ndecisions of those two peers). This, of course, is only half the battle: where \nand how those privacy coins are to be traded is also at issue.\n\n\nRegulation and Privacy-Preserving Assets\nMonero, Dash, Particl, Firo and other privacy coins are spearheading many\ntechnologies in the ever-evolving domain of cryptic currency. With them,\nanonymous transactions, at least to people that understand the initial vision,\nestablished themselves as a necessary component of Satoshi’s famous whitepaper.\nAnd by extension, privacy-focused decentralized exchanges also revealed\nthemselves as necessary for said transactional privacy to take on any meaningful\nform.\n\nTrading exchanges, where most of the liquidity lies, are increasingly being\naffected by government regulations, transforming them to become highly regulated\nmen-in-the-middle of most trades. This is obviously anathema to the original\ncypherpunk vision of privacy coins and cryptocurrency in general — still, to\nthis day, most privacy coins are traded on centralized exchanges. \n\nThis is a fatal compromise on the very concept of private currencies, and a\ncritical obstacle for privacy technologies; but it is a reality that projects\nmust nonetheless navigate through, in compliance. \n\nThe question of liquidity is also to consider within this kind of hyper-private,\ndecentralized ethos. Well-populated, centralized exchanges and order books are\nthe norm, and for a long time were considered necessary for mass adoption. This,\nof course, lent itself to disasters, such as the FTX debacle\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-collapse-explained]\n, the BTC-e shutdown\n[https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged]\n, the BitFinex hack\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitfinex-hacked-hongkong-idUSKCN10E0KP], and\nothers. Most cryptocurrency users came to understand this the hard way: although\ndecentralized exchange adoption is still lacking, it seems “holding your own\nkeys” is now more ingrained into the crypto psyche than it ever was.\n\nHyper-privacy and the AMM Model\nAnother noteworthy, but often overlooked, compromise on total privacy and\nresilience is the current (some say, inherent) state of automated market makers,\nor AMMs. AMMs are essential to the vast majority of currently existing DEX\nexchanges and bring us one step closer to leaving custodial solutions behind for\ngood. However, they are not without flaws: impermanent losses and associated\nfees are commonly cited, but AMM-based models actually have to contend with many\npotential vulnerabilities, with regard to both security and privacy.\n\nFrom a security perspective, smart contracts and the complex collaborations\nbetween them can, of course, lead to potential protocol vulnerabilities. BSX, by\ndesign, opts for “lower-level” alternatives to smart contracts deemed safer,\nsuch as scriptless scripts and adaptor signatures\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_technicals.html].\nOn the other hand, AMM liquidity pools often make heavy use of smart contracts,\nwhich have in the past made them targets of malicious attacks such as \nreentrancy\nattacks [https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack], among many\nothers. Reentrancy attacks occur when a trusted smart contract makes an external\ncall to a separate, untrusted smart contract, in order to exploit a potential\nbug in the code which would allow it to drain or manipulate smart contract\nassets. This can have devastating effects on targeted liquidity pools, and by\nextension to AMM liquidity providers - the Siren protocol, which was victim of\nsuch a hack in 2021\n[https://halborn.com/explained-the-siren-protocol-hack-september-2021/] to the\ntune of $3.5 million dollars, is merely one example out of many.\n\nOther security contingencies that AMM liquidity providers have to contend with\ninclude oracle attacks\n[https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217]\n, block timestamp manipulation\n[https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack], and the\ninfamous rug pulls that have become far too common. The semi-centralized aspects\nof AMMs, especially AMMs powered by in-house tokens such as Sushiswap or\nPancakeSwap, also amount to a security flaw in some respects, as the only way to\nensure that liquidity providers on AMMs are consistently profitable is often by\ncounteracting losses with heavy, hyper-inflationary financial incentives in the\nform of newly created native tokens.\n\nPotential privacy vulnerabilities within AMM models are also to be considered.\nIt is absolutely necessary for the BSX protocol to be entirely impervious to\nblockchain analysis and identity tracing to safeguard the personal safety of its\nusers — especially when swapping directly with unknown parties — which is a\npotential liability that most AMM-based DEXs, even ones that rely on standard\natomic swaps, have to contend with. \n\nTo that end, BSX employs adaptor signatures\n[https://github.com/ElementsProject/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md] \nto allow for completely hidden atomic swaps, without any sort of matching hashes\non participating blockchains, thus preventing any sort of analysis or\nlinkability of transactions over time. In combination with that, BasicSwap’s\ntype of order book, where one can pick and choose offers instead of having to\nfollow bid and ask curves, provides a user experience that is similar to that of\ncentralized exchanges but ensures total obfuscation of what is being traded and\nwhen. This ensures that the protocol is highly resilient against analysis,\nincluding identity tracing and behavioral model inference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that “DEX” exchanges that are confined to one chain, or\nits clones (via “bridges”), also come with their own fatal compromises on\nabsolute privacy and security, as exemplified by critical vulnerabilities\n[https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all] \ndiscovered in November of last year.\n\nCommunity Liquidity with BasicSwap\nThe above considerations and the harsh reality of difficult and complex\nregulations which projects must navigate through, in compliance, weigh heavily\nin the protocol design of BasicSwap, especially with regard to encouraging\nliquidity within the network without sacrificing security or privacy. \n\nBasicSwap, a free and completely cross-chain decentralized trading protocol\nusing a novel implementation of atomic swap-based trading and the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], is\nmeant as a zero-compromise alternative for private peer-to-peer trades - that\nmeans a lot of liquidity solutions available for other decentralized exchanges,\neven ones with an eye for privacy, are rejected by BasicSwap as privacy\ncompromises on one level or another. Providing liquidity responsibly and safely\nhas traditionally been one of the bigger challenges for trustless exchanges\nbetween peers, and while solutions do exist and will no doubt continue to be\nbuilt and improved upon, they must ultimately satisfy a strict list of criteria\nin order to fit with the end goal of the BasicSwap protocol.\n\nTo this end, BSX also opted for an entirely user-supported and distributed\norderbook-like format for trades, similar to what is typically seen on\ncentralized trading exchanges, minus the centralized, intermediated aspects.\nThis hardline, no-compromise approach is by design; whenever you trade Monero,\nParticl, PIVX, Dash, or other coins on BSX, not only do you help yourself by\nbecoming more resilient against the possible threats that centralized exchanges\nand AMM DEX solutions bring, but you also do your part in improving the\nblockchain’s resilience against privacy-targeting attacks of all kinds. Simply\nby deciding to trade your crypto on such an exchange, you make privacy coins and\ntheir ecosystems more private and more unstoppable, by leaving no trace behind.\n\nThat is why we invite you, if you care about privacy as we do, to spread the\nword about BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html] \nand the existential issues that centralized and AMM DEX solutions bring to\nuncompromising privacy and security. It is free to use, open source, does not\nrely on native tokens, and involves absolutely no KYC or account requirements —\nthis arrangement offers only advantages for both you and the networks of the\ncoins you’re trading.\n\nEvery little bit helps, and we can all be a big part of this fight for our\nfreedoms and privacy. Even if this seems like a small step to you, bringing even\none person to trade their privacy coins on a decentralized exchange like BSX can\nhave a profound impact!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their new,\nhyper-private type powered by Adaptor Signatures, make sure to give these\nfollowing articles a read!\n\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 2\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 3\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-private-ethereum-swaps/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

This is obviously anathema to the original cypherpunk vision of privacy coins and cryptocurrency in general — still, to this day, most privacy coins are traded on centralized exchanges. </p><p><strong>This is a fatal compromise on the very concept of private currencies, and a critical obstacle for privacy technologies; but it is a reality that projects must nonetheless navigate through, in compliance. </strong></p><p>The question of liquidity is also to consider within this kind of hyper-private, decentralized ethos. Well-populated, centralized exchanges and order books are the norm, and for a long time were considered necessary for mass adoption. This, of course, lent itself to disasters, such as the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-collapse-explained\">FTX debacle</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged\">BTC-e shutdown</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitfinex-hacked-hongkong-idUSKCN10E0KP\">BitFinex hack</a>, and others. Most cryptocurrency users came to understand this the hard way: although decentralized exchange adoption is still lacking, it seems “holding your own keys” is now more ingrained into the crypto psyche than it ever was.</p><h2 id=\"hyper-privacy-and-the-amm-model\">Hyper-privacy and the AMM Model</h2><p>Another noteworthy, but often overlooked, compromise on total privacy and resilience is the current (some say, inherent) state of automated market makers, or AMMs. AMMs are essential to the vast majority of currently existing DEX exchanges and bring us one step closer to leaving custodial solutions behind for good. However, they are not without flaws: impermanent losses and associated fees are commonly cited, but AMM-based models actually have to contend with many potential vulnerabilities, with regard to both security and privacy.</p><p>From a security perspective, smart contracts and the complex collaborations between them can, of course, lead to potential protocol vulnerabilities. BSX, by design, opts for “lower-level” alternatives to smart contracts deemed safer, such as<a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_technicals.html\"> scriptless scripts and adaptor signatures</a>. On the other hand, AMM liquidity pools often make heavy use of smart contracts, which have in the past made them targets of malicious attacks such as<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack\"> reentrancy attacks</a>, among many others. Reentrancy attacks occur when a trusted smart contract makes an external call to a separate, untrusted smart contract, in order to exploit a potential bug in the code which would allow it to drain or manipulate smart contract assets. This can have devastating effects on targeted liquidity pools, and by extension to AMM liquidity providers - the Siren protocol, which was<a href=\"https://halborn.com/explained-the-siren-protocol-hack-september-2021/\"> victim of such a hack in 2021</a> to the tune of $3.5 million dollars, is merely one example out of many.</p><p>Other security contingencies that AMM liquidity providers have to contend with include<a href=\"https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217\"> oracle attacks</a>,<a href=\"https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack\"> block timestamp manipulation</a>, and the infamous rug pulls that have become far too common. The semi-centralized aspects of AMMs, especially AMMs powered by in-house tokens such as Sushiswap or PancakeSwap, also amount to a security flaw in some respects, as the only way to ensure that liquidity providers on AMMs are consistently profitable is often by counteracting losses with heavy, hyper-inflationary financial incentives in the form of newly created native tokens.</p><p>Potential privacy vulnerabilities within AMM models are also to be considered. It is absolutely necessary for the BSX protocol to be entirely impervious to blockchain analysis and identity tracing to safeguard the personal safety of its users — especially when swapping directly with unknown parties — which is a potential liability that most AMM-based DEXs, even ones that rely on standard atomic swaps, have to contend with. </p><p>To that end, BSX employs <a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md\">adaptor signatures</a> to allow for completely hidden atomic swaps, <strong>without any sort of matching hashes on participating blockchains</strong>, thus preventing any sort of analysis or linkability of transactions over time. In combination with that, BasicSwap’s type of order book, where one can pick and choose offers instead of having to follow bid and ask curves, provides a user experience that is similar to that of centralized exchanges but ensures total obfuscation of what is being traded and when. This ensures that the protocol is highly resilient against analysis, including identity tracing and behavioral model inference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that “DEX” exchanges that are confined to one chain, or its clones (via “bridges”), also come with their own fatal compromises on absolute privacy and security, as exemplified by<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all\"> critical vulnerabilities</a> discovered in November of last year.</p><h2 id=\"community-liquidity-with-basicswap\">Community Liquidity with BasicSwap</h2><p>The above considerations and the harsh reality of difficult and complex regulations which projects must navigate through, in compliance, weigh heavily in the protocol design of BasicSwap, especially with regard to encouraging liquidity within the network without sacrificing security or privacy. </p><p>BasicSwap, a free and completely <strong>cross-chain</strong> decentralized trading protocol using a novel implementation of atomic swap-based trading and the<a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"> SMSG network</a>, is meant as a zero-compromise alternative for private peer-to-peer trades - that means a lot of liquidity solutions available for other decentralized exchanges, even ones with an eye for privacy, are rejected<strong> </strong>by BasicSwap as privacy compromises on one level or another. Providing liquidity responsibly and safely has traditionally been one of the bigger challenges for trustless exchanges between peers, and while solutions do exist and will no doubt continue to be built and improved upon, they must ultimately satisfy a strict list of criteria in order to fit with the end goal of the BasicSwap protocol.</p><p>To this end, BSX also opted for an entirely user-supported and distributed orderbook-like format for trades, similar to what is typically seen on centralized trading exchanges, minus the centralized, intermediated aspects. This hardline, no-compromise approach is by design; whenever you trade Monero, Particl, PIVX, Dash, or other coins on BSX, not only do you help yourself by becoming more resilient against the possible threats that centralized exchanges and AMM DEX solutions bring, but you also do your part in improving the blockchain’s resilience against privacy-targeting attacks of all kinds. Simply by deciding to trade your crypto on such an exchange, you make privacy coins and their ecosystems more private and more unstoppable, by leaving no trace behind.</p><p>That is why we invite you, if you care about privacy as we do, to<a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html\"> spread the word about BasicSwap</a> and the existential issues that centralized and AMM DEX solutions bring to uncompromising privacy and security.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
