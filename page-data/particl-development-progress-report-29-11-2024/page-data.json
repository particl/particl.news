112 commits coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2], we are\nexcited to announce the release of BasicSwap version 0.14.2, along with an\nupdate to its user interface, now at version 3.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, and new features. The changes stem from\nextensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a\nsignificant step forward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nThis update welcomes Bitcoin Cash and implements several key improvements across\nall aspects of the platform, including changes to the codebase, the user\ninterface, and to individual coin integrations such as Monero.\n\nNotably, a key technical change is the complete replacement of SQLAlchemy with\nmanbearpigSQL, our custom-built hybrid database system. This transition\nsimplifies BasicSwap's data management processes while solidifying security by\neliminating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nWe extend special thanks to Ofrnxmr, Mbacoinin, and mainnet_pat for their code\ncontributions this month, as well as to our dedicated community members who have\nhelped identify bugs and areas for improvement through thorough testing and\nfeedback. This update would not have been possible without their valuable\nefforts and support!\n\nFor a comprehensive list of all changes, please refer to the final section of\nthis blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\n\nTo install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface\nupdates, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\nDocker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image (docker-compose stop),\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build --no-cache command,\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nNon-Docker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap follow the non-Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly,\n * From the ~/coinswaps/basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * Execute the following command: pip install --require-hashes -r\n   requirements.txt,\n * Execute the following command: pip3 install .,\n * Launch BasicSwap as usual.\n\nInstall Script\n> If you've installed BasicSwap using Nahuhh's Github installation script\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/]...\n * Execute the update command twice: bsx-update && bsx-update.\n\nChangelog ?\nNew Coins\n * Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nAPI\n * Rates and prices are now updated in one single API call instead of one call\n   per coin\n * Fixed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) market rate calculation via API\n * Added set_max_concurrent_bids helper\n * Optionally display events with states\n\nUI Code\n * Refactored the javascript code of the Offers page\n * Refactored the javascript code of the Wallets page\n\nUI\n * The new offer page remembers the last SMSG address used\n * Added a modal to review and confirm a bid's parameters before submitting\n * When publishing an offer on the public order book, rate variable is forced to\n   false\n * When publishing an offer on the public order book, amount variable is forced\n   to true\n * When publish an offer on the public order book, auto-accept is forced to true\n * Fixed various issues with Wownero chart and rates\n * Added a smart refresh button to offers table\n * Fixed caching system for Wallets page\n * Improved the show/hide functionality of the Wallets page (now also applies to\n   cryptocurrencies, not just fiat values)\n * Fixed a UI issue that caused bids to be sent twice\n * Fixed a UI issue that caused connection reset problems\n * Fixed caching system for order book\n * Added better filtering functionality to order book tables\n * Order book and price charts caching system now set to 5 minutes\n * After successfully placing a bid, the user is now automatically redirected to\n   the bid page\n * Order book filters now include \"Revoked\" and \"Expired\"\n * Fixed a bug that prevented a deposit address to be properly copied\n * Allow js_offers limit to be set above PAGE_LIMIT\n * Correct date now on displayed chart\n * Wallet blocks and depth requirements now displayed in Wallets page\n\nCore Functionality\n * basicswap-prepare script forces version to respect withcoins\n * basicswap-prepare script now applies disablecoin/addcoin for\n   manage_wallet_daemon\n * basicswap-prepare script doesn't start daemon if coin config exists in\n   basicswap.json anymore\n * Removed incomplete feature from market making companion script\n * Market making script now parses more than one page of offers\n * Allow startup of XMR wallet with a busy daemon\n * Improve XMR startup speed and remove extra wallet open and refresh processes\n * Improve XMR state saving\n * Fixed the functionality that checks for expired offers\n * Set state for expired reverse bids\n * Vastly improved the auto-accept functionality (eliminates a wide variety of\n   possible errors and failures)\n * Fixed the functionality that checks for Particl balances across different\n   states\n * Adjust wallet names for Particl anon and Particl blind interfaces\n * getUnspentByAddr now correctly retrieves unspent Particl blind UTXOs\n * Add debugind to prevent spending coin A lock transaction\n * Fixed unbound error when no wallet data is cached\n * Bypass .local domains when Tor is enabled\n * Reformat entire codebase according to \"Black\" standard (code aesthetic and\n   format standardization.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
