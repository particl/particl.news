This means making certain that all changes for the testnet release\n(and, after that, the mainnet release) are merged and included where they need\nto be.\n\nStyling of the New Community Governance Module\nWhile the new governance module is completed in terms of functionality, it's\ncurrently going through a styling phase (UI/UX) which should also be completed\nin the next few days.\n\nNote that the new governance module may have disabled buttons or functions for\nthis coming testnet round if the styling fixes are not completed by the time of\nreleasing the testnet. Regardless, the module will be entirely ready for Particl\nV3's mainnet release.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nBuilding and Releasing the New Particl V3 on Testnet\nThe next item to  be completed is to release Particl V3 on testnet for what\nshould be its final round of community testing.\n\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository.

Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will lead you to\nconnect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other people will\nnot be relayed, and you won’t be able to use anon/blind balances or Particl\nMarketplace.\n> Note 2: If you are casting your vote for the proposal currently going through\nits voting period (the first team funding request\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-vote-scheduled/]), then that means\nthat you are already using Particl Core 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If that's the\ncase, there is nothing more for you to do, you're already all set!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s this Hardfork About?\nThis coming hardfork, scheduled for the 12th of July, 2021 at 17:00 UTC and\nactivated by Particl Core 0.19.2.12, has two primary purposes.\n\nRe-Enabling Temporarily Disabled Anon and Blind Balances\nParticl Vulnerability DisclosureLearn everything about Particl’s recent\nvulnerability discovery and emergency hardfork.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]The Particl team\nnoticed, in February 2021, a discrepancy between the expected and the observed\nsupply. Indeed, it was found that there were more coins in circulation than\nthere should.\n\nThe team immediately investigated the situation and discovered that an attacker\nhad exploited the chain. This allowed a hacker to create a certain number of\ncoins out of thin air to sell them on the trading markets. The bug that made\nthis possible was located and fixed in an emergency hardfork, leading to anon\nand blind balances being temporarily disabled.\n\nThe hardfork re-enables legitimate anon and blind balances while keeping\nexploited ones disabled.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model Activation\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]\nAdditionally, the Particl community recently approved a new treasury model to\nprovide the ecosystem with a decentralized and perpetual source of PART income.\nThis allows anyone to create and publish proposals on the CCS platform and get\ntheir initiative(s) funded if approved by the community through an on-chain\nvote.\n\nThe hardfork activates this new treasury model live on mainnet.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and land on the proper chain, all\nyou need to do is update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.12 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212Hashes8381f9a3f00c4515c32f87d9a66cc04ce3de2ad1aad95171e7c4cd99d91b46dc\nparticl-0.19.2.12-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] * Download\n   link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12\n\nThis version is already live, as a full release, and you can download it\ndirectly on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If you are\ncold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, simply enter\nthis command to update your node: cd ~/partyman && ./partyman update.\n\nOnce you’ve updated your node, you don’t need to do anything else. You’ll\nhardfork on the 12th of July, at 17:00 UTC, with the rest of the network. The\nhardfork is an entirely automatic process as long as you’re running the correct\ncore version.\n\nAnything Else Included in the Hardfork?\nThe two main items of this hardfork have been detailed in the first section of\nthis blog post, after the introduction. However, a few other minor items are\nincluded, which are available in the release notes of Particl Core 0.19.2.12.\nYou can simply follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212] \nto get the full list of additions included in this release.\n\nMaking Particl V3’s Mainnet Release Possible\nAn important but indirect result of this hardfork is that it will make the\nmainnet release of Particl V3 possible. Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on\nmainnet up until the hardfork.\n\nThat’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client,\nuses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling\nescrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind\nbalances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.\n\nAs the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and\nthus able to be released on mainnet.\n\nAs an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one\nweek after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3\nrelease ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as\nsmoothly as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and\nwants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through\nthis unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are\nincredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the\nParticl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.\n\nFollowing the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new\npost-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the\necosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.\n\nWe cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized\ne-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience! So stay awesome, and let’s rock the\nmonths and years to come, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Particl V3 progress report\nwe’d like to share with you. It highlights all the progress made over Particl V3\nand indicates what the items that are going to be focused on next week and\nbeyond are.\n\nThis week, the main focus has been on resolving the stealth address issue, which\nalso has implications on the OMP Library. Although the issue hasn't been fully\nresolved yet, progress has been made in reducing the number of stealth addresses\ngenerated when using Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Desktop has also been tested extensively with the new Particl Core\nversion (0.19.2.12)\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] which is\ncompatible with the coming hardfork. No issue or odd behavior has been observed.\n\nFinally, some redundant packages and pieces of code have been removed from\nParticl Desktop in a bid to make it more lightweight and make it easier to apply\nmajor dependency updates in the future.\n\nWith all of the above said, here's the list of outstanding issues to be fixed\nwith Particl Desktop.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\nIssue With Bids Failing but Still Locking Funds for Escrow\nAn issue identified by the community causes, in some circumstances, bids to fail\nbut still lead to coins being \"soft-locked\" (or reserved) for escrow. This bug\nwill now have a higher priority now that the two other major items have been\ncrossed off the to-do list (.CSV export and governance module).\n\nMore details regarding this issue by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1777\n\nStealth Address Usage\nAn issue with the Particl Marketplace codebase is that it generates an\nincredibly large number of stealth addresses when using it. This can cause\nsignificant performance issues for heavy users and can lead to long times\nrequired to sync wallets.\n\nThe issue is currently being investigated, though it is not a simple task.\nFixing this behavior will significantly improve the performance of the\nmarketplace for heavy users.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository.

It requests\n35,250 PART per month from the treasury fund for a period of 6 months only\nafter\nwhich the team will submit a new funding...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]Over the past few weeks, the Particl team has proposed an out-of-the-box\nstrategy to fund the development and expansion of the Particl ecosystem and the\nteam’s operations [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/].\n\nThe strategy consists of a new decentralized treasury model that gets\nautomatically funded by the protocol using a portion of the network’s staking\nrewards. Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then\nsubmit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the\ntreasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote. This\nprovides the Particl ecosystem with an adequate PART income source intended to\nsupport and enhance the Particl project.\n\nFor a project, idea, or initiative to be funded from the Treasury Fund, it needs\nto be first published on the CCS platform as a proposal, and then, go through an\non-chain voting round. That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing\nits funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds\nthat will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related\noperations for a duration of 6 months.\n\nParticl Team’s Funding Request\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250\nPART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this\nperiod expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to\npublish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\nAlthough this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring\nmore financial stability and security to the project.\n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide\nfunding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different\npurposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended\nto be split.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0),\n   BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities.\n * Management, legal, and administration (8%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (12%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange\n   listing budgets.\n\nThe Team's Vision Moving Forward\nIn the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount\nof capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on\ndevelopment. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl\nMarketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking,\nand the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.\n\nOther areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and\ncommunity growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to\nthese areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s\nprecisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.\n\nMore Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth\nParticl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its\nblockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the\nway they deserve. That’s all about to change!\n\nAs part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed\nfrom the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives\naimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will\nestablish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.\n\nAdditionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and\nis scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.\n\nSupporting and Expanding the Team\nFor the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal\nrestructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized\ntreasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we\nhave identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have\nworked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding\nallows it.\n\nThis restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership,\ncommunications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic\nobjectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.\n\nAt the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members\nto be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.\n\n * Cryptoguard — Project management and communications\n * Gerlof van Ek (crz) — Project and development management, Lead Designer,\n   UI/UX, and front-end developer\n * Imran — Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships\n * Henk Swardt — Development management and coordinator\n * Tecnovert — Lead core developer\n * Arnold Bansemer — Lead desktop developer\n * Kewde — Marketplace developer, OMP, and core\n * Juha Kovanen — Marketplace developer\n * Martin — UI & UX integration and front-end developer\n * Dros — Marketing, branding, and business research & development\n * Dasource — Technical research & development\n\nNote: More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents\nthe current situation at the time of writing this blog post.\n\nTeam Expansion\nFunding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A\ngreater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or\ncontracting work with partners.\n\nThe expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically\ndeployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.\n\nAdditionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its\nadvisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.\n\nEncouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions\nAlthough the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its\noperations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led\ngovernance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its\nlevel of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led\ninitiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.\n\nTo that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools,\ndocumentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new\nideas and projects.\n\nBudgets and Expenses\nInfrastructure Expenses\n“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to\nassure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited\nto, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain\nregistrations, server maintenance, etc. \n\nAt the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a\npersonal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are\nintended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off\nindividual team members.\n\nBudgets\n\n“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that\nthe team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl\necosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not\ninclude team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.\n\nMarketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)\n\n * Content Creation, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube,\n   social media channels, and other mediums.\n * Digital Ads, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e.,\n   Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.\n * Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program, to grow the number of active vendors\n   on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.\n\nMarketing Funds (Event-based)\n\n * Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards, to help grow the project with new\n   members/users and keep things interesting within the community.\n * Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, to increase Particl’s exposure by\n   leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).\n * Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns, to increase Particl’s exposure in\n   blockchain and technology-related media.\n * Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), to increase\n   Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.\n\nExchange Listings and Partnerships Fund\n\n * Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, to get Particl listed on\n   quality exchanges and other third-party services.\n * Partnership and team collaboration funds, to ease the establishment of\n   partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.\n\nLegal Fund\n\n * Legal costs, to pay for any required legal services.\n * Corporate fees, to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.\n\nEach month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the\nParticl team from the treasury model.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific\nbudget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for\nexample, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that\nprecisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will\nremain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that\nspecific budget to be used later on, as needed.\n\nAlthough these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as\nwe progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the\nnumber of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly\nreviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward.\nNew budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team\nwants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation\nand to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.\n\nThe Reserve Fund\nAny extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries,\nexpenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This\nincludes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources\nof income for the team.\n\nThis Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against\nsudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is\nexpected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing\nsafety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.\n\nA New Legal Entity to Support the Project\nTo support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with\nany legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly\njurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over\nthe previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug,\nSwitzerland.\n\n * A more flexible legal entity operating within a well-respected and\n   pro-blockchain jurisdiction.\n * Clear and progressive legal guidance for blockchain and cryptocurrency\n   projects.\n * More financially efficient structure with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller\n   monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.\n\nThis new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such\nas acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges),\nholding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury,\nemitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments\n(i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases\n(i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.\n\nThe Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed\nagreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set\nup the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new\nlegal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal\nends so that the project can move forward swiftly.\n\nNote: The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not\nresponsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.\n\nLet’s Summarize\nThere’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this\nproposal gets you.\n\n * Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more\n   defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings\n   overall quality improvement in all business areas.\n * Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will\n   significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.\n * Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development,\n   marketing, legal, business, etc.\n * New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing\n   on the products and their benefits.\n * Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors\n   and customers.\n * Commitment to grow the user base and community.\n * Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges,\n   third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.\n\nWith the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the\nParticl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make\nit stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the\nParticl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of\nmarketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following \nthis link [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]. \n\nThe proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so\nplease leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or\ncomment. As always, the schedule for this proposal’s voting period will be\nclearly announced a few days before it starts on all the usual Particl channels.\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal.

A greater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or contracting work with partners.</p><p>The expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically deployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.</p><p>Additionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its advisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.</p><h3 id=\"encouraging-and-stimulating-third-party-contributions\">Encouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions</h3><p>Although the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its operations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led governance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its level of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led initiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.</p><p>To that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools, documentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new ideas and projects.</p><h2 id=\"budgets-and-expenses\">Budgets and Expenses</h2><h3 id=\"infrastructure-expenses\"><strong>Infrastructure Expenses</strong></h3><p>“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to assure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited to, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain registrations, server maintenance, etc. </p><p>At the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a personal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are intended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off individual team members.</p><p><strong>Budgets</strong></p><p>“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that the team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not include team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.</p><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube, social media channels, and other mediums.</li><li><strong>Digital Ads</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e., Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.</li><li><strong>Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program</strong>, to grow the number of active vendors on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Event-based)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards</strong>, to help grow the project with new members/users and keep things interesting within the community.</li><li><strong>Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure by leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).</li><li><strong>Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in blockchain and technology-related media.</li><li><strong>Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.</li></ul><p><strong>Exchange Listings and Partnerships Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, </strong></strong></strong>to get Particl listed on quality exchanges and other third-party services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Partnership and team collaboration funds, </strong></strong></strong>to ease the establishment of partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Legal </strong></strong>costs<strong><strong>,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any required legal services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Corporate fees,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.</li></ul><p>Each month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the Particl team from the treasury model.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific budget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for example, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that precisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will remain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that specific budget to be used later on, as needed.</p><p>Although these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as we progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the number of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly reviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward. New budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team wants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation and to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.</p><h3 id=\"the-reserve-fund\"><strong>The Reserve Fund</strong></h3><p>Any extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries, expenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This includes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources of income for the team.</p><p>This Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against sudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is expected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing safety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-legal-entity-to-support-the-project\">A New Legal Entity to Support the Project</h2><p>To support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with any legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over the previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug, Switzerland.</p><ul><li>A <strong>more flexible</strong> legal entity operating within a well-respected and pro-blockchain jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Clear and progressive legal guidance</strong> for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.</li><li><strong>More financially efficient structure </strong>with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.</li></ul><p>This new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such as acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges), holding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury, emitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments (i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases (i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.</p><p>The Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed agreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set up the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new legal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal ends so that the project can move forward swiftly.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not responsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.</em></p><h1 id=\"let-s-summarize\"><strong>Let’s Summarize</strong></h1><p>There’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this proposal gets you.</p><ul><li>Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings overall quality improvement in all business areas.</li><li>Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.</li><li>Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development, marketing, legal, business, etc.</li><li>New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing on the products and their benefits.</li><li>Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors and customers.</li><li>Commitment to grow the user base and community.</li><li>Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges, third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.</li></ul><p>With the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the Particl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make it stand out above the crowd.

Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then submit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the treasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote. This provides the Particl ecosystem with an adequate PART income source intended to support and enhance the Particl project.</p><p>For a project, idea, or initiative to be funded from the Treasury Fund, it needs to be first published on the CCS platform as a proposal, and then, go through an on-chain voting round. That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing its funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds that will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related operations for a duration of 6 months.</p><h2 id=\"particl-team-s-funding-request\">Particl Team’s Funding Request</h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>This funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1. Although this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring more financial stability and security to the project.</p><p>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide funding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\">Funding Distribution Breakdown</h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended to be split.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (8%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (12%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products.

Particl V3 progress report\nwe’d like to share with you. It highlights all the progress made over Particl V3\nand indicates what the items that are going to be focused on next week and\nbeyond are.\n\nAlthough the following list hasn't changed a lot since the last update,\nsignificant progress have been made on the governance module and the CSV import\ntools. Indeed, both items are mostly done and should be ready to be tested in\nthe next testnet build of Particl V3.\n\nWithout further ado, here is a list of the items currently in progress and those\nremaining.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\nIssue With Bids Failing but Still Locking Funds for Escrow\nAn issue identified by the community causes, in some circumstances, bids to fail\nbut still lead to coins being \"soft-locked\" (or reserved) for escrow. This bug\nis still being worked on, and has gotten less attention this week due to the\nfocus being split with other items such as the governance module, the CSV export\nfunctionality, and the investigation on reducing the number of stealth addresses\nused by the marketplace (more details on that just below).\n\nMore details regarding this issue by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1777\n\nStealth Address Usage\nAn issue with the Particl Marketplace codebase is that it generates an\nincredibly large number of stealth addresses when using it. This can cause\nsignificant performance issues for heavy users and can lead to long times\nrequired to sync wallets.\n\nThe issue is currently being investigated, though it is not a simple task.\nFixing this behavior will significantly improve the performance of the\nmarketplace for heavy users.\n\nAdd a Governance Informational Section to Particl Desktop\nIntroduce an informational governance section to Particl Desktop to display\nproposals, voting progression, and results. This won’t allow you to vote\ndirectly on proposals, at least not yet, but it provides information on how to\nvote as well as information regarding upcoming, current, and past proposals (and\ntheir voting results).\n\nThe implementation of this new module onto Particl Desktop is complete. Focus is\nnow on providing additional GUI styling and cleaning up its UI/UX. \n\nMarketplace Orders Export Functionality\nAdding a CSV export tool for orders from the Market > Sell > Orders page is\ncurrently being explored. This would enable sellers to export useful order\ninformation that might benefit from being fed into other stock systems.\n\nThe implementation of this feature is mostly complete. It is now going through\nan internal testing phase and a few minor fixes are still being made.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nDelete a Product From the Inventory\nThis will let you delete products from your inventory if you don’t want them to\nbe displayed anymore. This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end\nspecific change.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nWe'd like to remind you that, although Particl V3 is mostly ready for mainnet at\nthis time, we still need to wait for Particl's upcoming hardfork to go live\nbefore it can be released. That's because Particl Marketplace relies on blind\nand anon transactions which will be re-enabled with the coming hardfork.\n\nAs always, we want to thank you all for your continued support and dedication to\nParticl’s vision! You are all what makes this project possible. Stay awesome!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This marks a significant moment in Particl history as the end\nresult is a new, more powerful self-funding mechanism for the ecosystem.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go through the timeline for the\ncoming weeks as the new decentralized treasury makes its way on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nThe Decentralized Treasury Proposal vote, the first-ever “protocol consensus\nchanging vote”, was an important milestone for Particl because it proposed\napplying critical changes to the protocol. Indeed, the proposal suggested\nraising the yearly PART coin emission rate from 2% to 8%, with half of the\nstaking rewards being automatically deposited into a treasury fund by the\nprotocol.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mind-blowing 96.6% approval rate (minimum required was 75%) and a \n70.6% participation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 10,080\nblocks, with 6,884 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 239 voting\nagainst it.\n\nThe participation rate for this voting round increased by ~7% compared to the\nprevious (and first) proposal that required a vote. This is an incredibly\nencouraging news in light of Particl’s transition into a community governed\nproject and shows just how active its stakeholders are.\n\nWhen Will it Go Live?\nNow that the results are official and that the decentralized treasury model has\nbeen approved, it can now be deployed on the Particl blockchain. For this to\nhappen requires a hardfork which relies on two deliverables.\n\nThe first one is, obviously, the integration of the decentralized treasury code\ninto the blockchain. The code for the changes has been completed and the build\nis now going through a thorough testing process on a side network (Particl clone\nnetwork).\n\nThe second deliverable is the integration of the output whitelist into the\nblockchain. This is tied to the output claim process which is currently ongoing.\nAs a reminder, the pre-fork process ends on June 21st, 2021. If you want your\ntemporarily disabled anon and blind outputs to be re-enabled in the coming\nhardfork, make sure you’ve read read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/] and submit your claim\nbefore that date, if needed.\n\nOnce the cutoff date of the claim period is reached, the final pre-fork output\nwhitelist will be bundled with the next Particl Core release and be submitted to\nexchanges so they can start the process of preparing for the coming hardfork. \n\nIf all goes well, Particl should be forking on the 12th of July, 2021. This is\ncurrently a target, the actual hardfork may happen a bit before or after,\ndepending on how fast exchanges and partners get ready for the fork. As always,\nwe will keep you updated with any news on the regard.\n\nThe Team Funding Proposal Goes Live Early This Week\nPutting in place a decentralized treasury model was only a first step in funding\nback the current Particl team. The second step is another proposal that will\nrequest capital from the treasury fund to fund the team and its operations. This\nproposal isn’t unlike what anyone else in the community can bring forward, but\nit’ll be Particl’s first-ever proposal to request resources from the treasury\nfund.\n\nThe proposal will detail the team’s strategy moving forward and will explain how\nit intends on utilizing the funds it is claiming. The proposal will be published\nand begin its discussion phase in the early moments of the week, on the CCS\nplatform. Make sure to be around if you want to provide comments and feedback on\nthe team proposal!\n\nNow’s the Best Time to Get Involved\nNow that the decentralized treasury model is about to go live on mainnet, you\ncan prepare your proposals and get them ready to be published. If, in the past,\nyou’ve had projects or ideas for Particl but couldn’t get the required capital\nto start them up, you now possess all you need to overcome that hurdle.\n\nBecause every submitted proposal first requires a discussion phase, and then a\nvoting phase of a minimum of one week, don’t hesitate to let the community about\nyour idea as soon as possible. This would ensure that the ecosystem and treasury\nfund get used right from the start and that no time is wasted before this new\naddition to the protocol starts benefiting the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is very excited about the new decentralized treasury\nmodel and can’t wait to see what you all come up with in terms of initiatives,\nprojects, businesses, and services. Particl now possesses the tools and\nresources to make anything happen; the sky is now the limit. It is now up to\neach and every one of us, the Particl community members, to make Particl a\nresounding success.

It highlights all the progress made over Particl V3\nand indicates what the items that are going to be focused on next week and\nbeyond are.\n\nNote that, primarily due to the focus on fixing minor issues around the new\ntestnet build, there is not much new stuff to report on. Primary work has been\ntroubleshooting, debugging, and fixing bugs and issues identified with the new\ntestnet build of Particl V3. \n\nProgress may appear to be slow, but despite appearances, there is steady\nprogression. For example, there have been at least two bugs found (and\nsubsequently corrected) during the investigation of another bug that was\nreported. \n\nIn addition, while the below items don't appear to have changed much since last\nweek, these are the bigger issues and finding, correcting, and testing them is\nexpected to take some time.\n\nWithout further ado, here is a list of the items currently in progress and those\nremaining.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\nWindows startup bug\nA zmq.node error causes startup problems for some Windows users. The issue makes\nlaunching and properly using Particl V3 impossible for these users. This is a\nParticl Desktop specific change.\n\nIssue With Flagging of Duplicate Listings\nAn issue related to the new testnet build has been logged on Github. In some\ncircumstances, listings may appear as duplicates, leading to Particl Desktop\nbeing unable to flag both listings. This is currently being investigated and\ncorrected. \n\nMore details regarding this issue by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1773\n\n> Note: A fix has been implemented for this issue. Testing is currently underway\nIssue With Bids Failing but Still Locking Funds for Escrow\nAn issue identified by the community causes, in some circumstances, bids to fail\nbut still lead to coins being \"soft-locked\" (or reserved) for escrow. \n\nMore details regarding this issue by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1777\n\nAdd a Governance Informational Section to Particl Desktop\nIntroduce an informational governance section to Particl Desktop to display\nproposals, voting progression, and results. This won’t allow you to vote\ndirectly on proposals, at least not yet, but it provides information on how to\nvote as well as information regarding upcoming, current, and past proposals (and\ntheir voting results).\n\nThe basic implementation of this module has now been drawn up and is waiting to\nbe implemented. There may still be additional iterations required, but this item\nis progressing well with no obstacle so far.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible. \n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. \n\nDelete a Product From the Inventory\nThis will let you delete products from your inventory if you don’t want them to\nbe displayed anymore. This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end\nspecific change.\n\nMarketplace Orders Export Functionality\nAdding a CSV export tool for orders from the Market > Sell > Orders page is\ncurrently being explored. This would enable sellers to export useful order\ninformation that might benefit from being fed into other stock systems.\n\nThis item has been temporarily de-prioritized due to this week's launch of the\nnew Particl V3 testnet build and the focus on newly reported issues from the\ntestnet. The developers will circle back to this item very shortly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow that the new Particl V3 testnet build is out, we need all hands on deck to\nfind any bug, issue, or potential improvement before going live on mainnet.\nWe've already received a few bug reports from the community and they've been\nhelpful in identifying other connected problems as well!\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository.

This marks a significant milestone\nfor the Particl ecosystem as it moves towards a more community-powered form of\ngovernance.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go over this proposal’s\nimplications.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nVoting for the Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] was a\nsignificant event for the Particl project. It was the first time a CCS proposal\nrequired to be approved through a vote and, for this reason, served as a great\nshowcase and test of Particl’s on-chain voting technology.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mindblowing 99.97% approval rate (minimum required is 60%) and a \n63.17% participation rate (minimum required is 20%). Indeed, the vote lasted for\n5,040 blocks, with 3,184 of them voting in favor of the proposal and just one\nblock voting against it.\n\nWhat About the Claim Process Now?\nWith the proposal officially approved by Particl stakeholders, now’s the time to\nget moving! As such, we can now announce that the claim period will begin\ntomorrow. To help you understand the output claim process and its timeline, we\nwill publish, tomorrow, a blog post on Particl News containing all the necessary\ninformation to submit your outputs and get them validated so that they can be\nre-enabled after the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIt’s important to be aware that the output claim process will be separated into\ntwo phases; the pre-fork and post-fork phases. \n\nIf you submit your outputs for validation before the upcoming hardfork and the\ncutoff date, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use\nyour currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course,\nimplies that your claim gets approved.\n\nKeep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance\nbefore the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the\nactual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase\nis actually going to be several days or weeks before the hardfork. We will\nclearly communicate this deadline before its time.\n\nIf you submit your outputs after the upcoming hardfork, then you’ll be part of\nthe post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but\nyou’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current\ntime, not scheduled.\n\nFor this reason, we strongly recommend submitting your outputs as fast as you\ncan.\n\nHeaded Towards Community Governance\nIt is safe to say that this on-chain voting exercise, the first of its kind on\nthe Particl network, was a resounding success. It highlights just how active\nParticl stakeholders are and how willing they are to actively participate in the\ngovernance of the project.\n\nWith this highly encouraging participation rate in mind, you can expect more\nproposals requiring a vote to be published on the CCS in the weeks, months, and\nyears to come. Some of them may come from the Particl team itself, but anyone\ncan submit a proposal of their own and request a vote for it.\n\nOn that end, the Particl team would like to reiterate its position that it fully\nsupports and encourages quality community initiatives. It is by having a good\nmix of team and community proposals, as well as a significant diversity in the\nideas proposed on the CCS, that Particl will achieve optimal levels of\ndecentralization!\n\nSecond Proposal Voting to Begin This Week\nThe Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] is\nonly the first proposal to require on-chain voting of many to come. As such, a\nsecond proposal, the Decentralized Treasury Model proposal\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8], will begin its voting phase\nat the end of this week.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News as we will publish, later today, a blog post\nexplaining in detail the timeline for this proposal and its voting phase. If you\nstill have questions, comments, or general feedback about it, please leave a\ncomment on its Github page [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] \nbefore it gets merged into the voting phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your overwhelming support and participating in such\nnumbers in this critical first on-chain voting process for Particl. We are as\nconfident as ever moving forward with a more community-powered form of\ngovernance and are pretty excited to see all the great things we will achieve\ntogether!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

While it does not contain the fix for the\nstartup issue encountered by some Windows users, it fixes the vast majority of\npreviously reported problems during the first testnet round.\n\nTo download, install, and test out the new Particl V3 build on testnet, please\njump right to this Particl News blog post\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-v3-testnet-builds-available/]. It includes all\nthe instructions you need to follow to properly set up this new build, as well\nas a link to the complete list of changes since the last testnet round.\n\n> Important: If you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it\nto the Github Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located \nhere [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. \nIn Progress\nWindows startup bug\nA zmq.node error causes startup problems for some Windows users. The issue makes\nlaunching and properly using Particl V3 impossible for these users. This is a\nParticl Desktop specific change.\n\nIssue With Flagging of Duplicate Listings\nAn issue related to the new testnet build has been logged on Github. In some\ncircumstances, listings may appear as duplicates, leading to Particl Desktop\nbeing unable to flag both listings. This is currently being investigated and\ncorrected. \n\nMore details regarding this issue by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1773\n\nAdd a Governance Informational Section to Particl Desktop\nIntroduce an informational governance section to Particl Desktop to display\nproposals, voting progression, and results. This won’t allow you to vote\ndirectly on proposals, at least not yet, but it provides information on how to\nvote as well as information regarding upcoming, current, and past proposals (and\ntheir voting results).\n\nThe basic implementation of this module has now been drawn up and is waiting to\nbe implemented. There may still be additional iterations required, but this item\nis progressing well with no obstacle so far.\n\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible. \n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository.

This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end\nspecific change.\n\nMarketplace Orders Export Functionality\nAdding a CSV export tool for orders from the Market > Sell > Orders page is\ncurrently being explored. This would enable sellers to export useful order\ninformation that might benefit from being fed into other stock systems.\n\nThis item has been temporarily de-prioritized due to this week's launch of the\nnew Particl V3 testnet build and the focus on newly reported issues from the\ntestnet.

Particl V3 on testnet and\nbegin the second round of community testing. These new builds fix the vast\nmajority of previously identified bugs and issues. They also introduce various\ngeneral improvements to Particl Desktop and the back-end code of the\nmarketplace.\n\nBecause this release contains a lot of new code, it’s critical to get it\nproperly tested before it goes live on mainnet. That's where you come in!\n\nIf you encounter any problem while testing this new version of Particl V3 or\nhave feedback to give, please add a \"new issue\" on Github (click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new/choose]). Make sure to\nexplain in detail the problem you’ve encountered, how to reproduce it, and the\nOS you’re using. The Particl developers will then pick it up and work on it.\n\n> Note 1: The “Windows bug” preventing Particl V3 from launching properly for some\nWindows user is still present with this release. The cause has been identified\nand is currently being resolved. It is a slightly more complicated issue to fix\nand, for this reason, will be fixed in the next Particl V3 testnet build.\n> Note 2: Please follow carefully the installation instructions located in the\nsection below, especially if you’ve previously installed and run a Particl V3\ntestnet build.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.0.0-RC-test003: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.0.0-RC-test003\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.0.0 Public Testnet (release 3) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopSecond public testnet release build for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop v3.0.0NB!!

Using the last testnet client you've used before this new release, move all\n    testnet coins from any Market wallets to a different wallet (i.e., the\n    default wallet). Close Particl Desktop entirely so that it is no longer\n    running.\n 2. While Particl Desktop is NOT running, delete the testnet wallet folder \n    profiles (located in particl/testnet).\n 3. Then, delete the folder containing the MP database (located in \n    particl-market/testnet/03).\n\nLocation of Folders on Windows\n * Profiles Folder \n\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Particl\\testnet or \n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Particl\\testnet\\wallets\n\n * MP Database\n\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\\testnet\\03\"\n\nLocation of Folders on MacOS\n * Profiles Folder\n\n~/Library/Application Support/Particl/testnet\n\n * MP Database\n\n~/Library/Application Support/particl-market/testnet/03\n\nLocation of Folders on Linux\n * Profiles Folder\n\n~/.particl/testnet\n\n * MP Database\n\n~/.particl-market/testnet/03\n\nDiscussions and Feedback\nYour insights are infinitely valuable for us to enhance and improve Particl\nDesktop and Particl Marketplace. To that end, the Particl community forum\n[https://particl.community/] is the perfect place for focused discussions and to\nget to know what others have observed.\n\nTo help to streamline community testing for Particl V3-testnet, the community\nhas prepared a Marketplace Testing category to the forum where you can report\nissues to other community members and see what others are coming up with. Simply\nfollow this link [https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing] to\nland in the right place.\n\nStill, if you find any observation that has found a certain degree of consensus,\nyou are kindly asked to formally publish it on the Github Issues\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] page. This way, it is\nguaranteed that the developers won’t miss it.\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node:\n   addnode \"212.47.250.16:51938\" \"add\"\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * NB!! The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source\n   code. Please contact the Particl team for source code information.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nParticl Market\n- Update how categories are retrieved for various markets\n\n- Blacklisting of markets (when flagging/voting to remove markets) should not\nhappen when voting but when calculating the vote result\n\n- Prevent automatic deletion of any old/expired listings that are still included\nin a cart\n\n- Fixed removal of a joined market failing if the market has been flagged by the\ncurrent user\n\n- Updated the default categories for Open Market type of markets.\n\nParticl Desktop (Market Module)\n- Updated the identity drop-down toggle as it appears to do nothing if identity\ncreation/addition is disabled and there are no additional identities available\n(which is the default state)\n\n- Present a previously missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when attempting to create\na new market with an encrypted (locked) wallet\n\n- Display a more applicable error message when accepting a bid fails due to\ninsufficient funds\n\n- Swapped the positions of the public and anon balance amounts in the Overview\ncomponent (to make more sense, and was requested quite a bit by the community)\n\n- Display when a promoted market expires in the Market Browser tab.\n\n- Set the 'Completed and Archived' checkbox in both the Buy > Orders page and\nthe Sell > Orders page, to be checked by default. This addresses a concern that\ncompleted or cancelled orders seemed to disappear\n\n- Changed the country selection filters in the Browse [Listings] page to render\nwith check boxes next to the country name. Clearing a country filter by\nre-selecting it was not very clear before, and this attempts to guide the user\nby indicating that that a selected country can be re-selected to clear it\n\n- After successfully creating a storefront market, the category editor opens to\ndirect the storefront admin to add categories\n\n- Fixed input validation criteria on the Create Market page: max character\nlengths were not validating correctly.\n\n- Display the market ID key on each promoted market, so as to provide a unique\nidentifier for a promoted market.\n\n- Updated the code for retrieving the correct market category list when\npublishing products (necessary due to changes in the Market system's handling of\nlisting categories)\n\n- Fixed an intermittent issue when editing a previously created product in which\na market and category were selected and saved: the category may not have always\nbeen shown to be selected correctly, and the category list may have shown the\nincorrect category list.\n\n- Added an option to navigate back to 'Products and Listings' from the 'Product\nImport' section (previously the only option was to use the main menu to navigate\nback to the 'Sell' page, and subsequently to the 'Products and Listings' tab).\n\n- Fixed the linked URL for Transaction ID's displayed for an order in both the\nBuy > Orders page and the Sell > Orders page, that would always point to the\nmainnet block explorer rather than the testnet block explorer when running on\nthe testnet chain.\n\n-Fixed order notification counters not working as intended, particularly around\ncancelled/rejected/completed orders\n\nParticl Desktop (Wallet Module)\n- Allow for the transaction ID to be copied in both the Overview page as well as\nthe Transaction History page\n\n- Added a warning during address label editing that indicates that the label is\nnot saved until the save button is clicked\n\n- Zapping of cold staking funds is now disabled when the wallet balance is 0\n\n- Fixed an issue preventing someone from disabling cold staking when their\nwallet balance funds is 0.\n\nParticl Desktop (Layout and Styling)\n- Simplified the display of the wallet module's transaction table entries (also\nas viewed on the wallet module's Overview page)\n\n- Tweaked the background blur for modals (looks nicer now)\n\n- Aligned visual changes made in other tweaks with the overall application theme\n(i.e., updated the market visualization in the market browser for the displaying\nof the unique market ID as well as the displaying of the market promotion\nexpiration time)\n\n- Added an explicit section in the market creation page detailing how a created\nmarket is private by default unless the keys are shared or the market is\npromoted\n\n- Minor styling tweaks and cleanup of unused styles\n\nGeneral\n- Enabled the generation of Windows 32-bit builds again\n\n- Fixed an error message being displayed that crashes the application when the\nuser closes the application while the market module is starting up.\n\n- Testing, updates and fixes related to updating Particl Core versions 0.19.2.5 \nto 0.19.2.8\n\n- Allow for specific URLs to be opened in the user's current browser instead of\nin a webview container within the application\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to fix parsing of startup params/flags that\ncontain dashes\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to allow for the core console modal to\nprocess command string escapings as per Particl Core\n\n- Fixed various spelling mistakes in the text\n\n- Added the ability to display a randomized \"Message of the Day\" on the\nloading/welcome page. These are not currently displayed as the messages are not\nyet available, but the functionality is now available\n\n- Updated text strings where applicable\n\n- Fixed CircleCI test runner to execute again (note: just gets CircleCI running\nagain - testing still fails due to problematic test cases which still need to be\nfixed and/or written)\n\n- Enabled codespell checks during test execution\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second round of community testing has started, now let's get cracking! Don't\nforget to also spread the word around about the upcoming Particl V3 mainnet\nrelease. Every bit helps, whether that is testing, promoting, or even just\nsharing screenshots and GIFs of Particl V3! \n\nWe are blessed to have such a dedicated and passionate community, and for this\nreason, we'd like to thank you for your continued support and patience as we get\nthis baby ready for mainnet!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not include some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market\">Particl Market</h3><p>- Update how categories are retrieved for various markets</p><p>- Blacklisting of markets (when flagging/voting to remove markets) should not happen when voting but when calculating the vote result</p><p>- Prevent automatic deletion of any old/expired listings that are still included in a cart</p><p>- Fixed removal of a joined market failing if the market has been flagged by the current user</p><p>- Updated the default categories for Open Market type of markets.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-market-module-\">Particl Desktop (Market Module)</h3><p>- Updated the identity drop-down toggle as it appears to do nothing if identity creation/addition is disabled and there are no additional identities available (which is the default state)</p><p>- Present a previously missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when attempting to create a new market with an encrypted (locked) wallet</p><p>- Display a more applicable error message when accepting a bid fails due to insufficient funds</p><p>- Swapped the positions of the public and anon balance amounts in the Overview component (to make more sense, and was requested quite a bit by the community)</p><p>- Display when a promoted market expires in the Market Browser tab.</p><p>- Set the 'Completed and Archived' checkbox in both the Buy > Orders page and the Sell > Orders page, to be checked by default. This addresses a concern that completed or cancelled orders seemed to disappear</p><p>- Changed the country selection filters in the Browse [Listings] page to render with check boxes next to the country name. Clearing a country filter by re-selecting it was not very clear before, and this attempts to guide the user by indicating that that a selected country can be re-selected to clear it</p><p>- After successfully creating a storefront market, the category editor opens to direct the storefront admin to add categories</p><p>- Fixed input validation criteria on the Create Market page: max character lengths were not validating correctly.</p><p>- Display the market ID key on each promoted market, so as to provide a unique identifier for a promoted market.</p><p>- Updated the code for retrieving the correct market category list when publishing products (necessary due to changes in the Market system's handling of listing categories)</p><p>- Fixed an intermittent issue when editing a previously created product in which a market and category were selected and saved: the category may not have always been shown to be selected correctly, and the category list may have shown the incorrect category list.</p><p>- Added an option to navigate back to 'Products and Listings' from the 'Product Import' section (previously the only option was to use the main menu to navigate back to the 'Sell' page, and subsequently to the 'Products and Listings' tab).</p><p>- Fixed the linked URL for Transaction ID's displayed for an order in both the Buy > Orders page and the Sell > Orders page, that would always point to the mainnet block explorer rather than the testnet block explorer when running on the testnet chain.</p><p>-Fixed order notification counters not working as intended, particularly around cancelled/rejected/completed orders</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-wallet-module-\">Particl Desktop (Wallet Module)</h3><p>- Allow for the transaction ID to be copied in both the Overview page as well as the Transaction History page</p><p>- Added a warning during address label editing that indicates that the label is not saved until the save button is clicked</p><p>- Zapping of cold staking funds is now disabled when the wallet balance is 0</p><p>- Fixed an issue preventing someone from disabling cold staking when their wallet balance funds is 0.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-layout-and-styling-\">Particl Desktop (Layout and Styling)</h3><p>- Simplified the display of the wallet module's transaction table entries (also as viewed on the wallet module's Overview page)</p><p>- Tweaked the background blur for modals (looks nicer now)</p><p>- Aligned visual changes made in other tweaks with the overall application theme (i.e., updated the market visualization in the market browser for the displaying of the unique market ID as well as the displaying of the market promotion expiration time)</p><p>- Added an explicit section in the market creation page detailing how a created market is private by default unless the keys are shared or the market is promoted</p><p>- Minor styling tweaks and cleanup of unused styles</p><h3 id=\"general\">General</h3><p>- Enabled the generation of Windows 32-bit builds again</p><p>- Fixed an error message being displayed that crashes the application when the user closes the application while the market module is starting up.</p><p>- Testing, updates and fixes related to updating Particl Core versions <code class=\"language-text\">0.19.2.5</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">0.19.2.8</code></p><p>- Allow for specific URLs to be opened in the user's current browser instead of in a webview container within the application</p><p>- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to fix parsing of startup params/flags that contain dashes</p><p>- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to allow for the core console modal to process command string escapings as per Particl Core</p><p>- Fixed various spelling mistakes in the text</p><p>- Added the ability to display a randomized \"Message of the Day\" on the loading/welcome page. These are not currently displayed as the messages are not yet available, but the functionality is now available</p><p>- Updated text strings where applicable</p><p>- Fixed CircleCI test runner to execute again (note: just gets CircleCI running again - testing still fails due to problematic test cases which still need to be fixed and/or written)</p><p>- Enabled codespell checks during test execution</p><hr><p>The second round of community testing has started, now let's get cracking!

It highlights all the progress made over the\ndevelopment of Particl V3 and indicates what the items that are going to be\nfocused on next week and beyond are.\n\nWithout further ado, here is a list of the items currently in progress and those\nremaining.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\nIn Progress\nParticl Desktop Testnet Release Builds\nThe team’s getting ready to release the new testnet build for Particl V3. As we\nfinalize the testing of all the latest fixes brought since the last build, you\ncan expect a new testnet round to go live by early next week.\n\nIt’s important to note that the issue preventing Particl Desktop from properly\nlaunching for some Windows users is still present and will be fixed in the next\ntestnet build. Fixing this issue is now actively in progress.\n\nAny support/assistance and bug fixes related to the testnet release.\nAssisting community testers once the new testnet build is out will be a priority\nto ensure the testing phase goes as smoothly and efficiently as possible.\n\nWindows startup bug\nA zmq.node error causes startup problems for some Windows users. The issue makes\nlaunching and properly using Particl V3 impossible for these users. This is a\nParticl Desktop specific change.\n\nAdd a Governance Informational Section to Particl Desktop\nIntroduce a governance informational section to Particl Desktop to display\nproposals, voting progression, and results. This won’t allow you to vote\ndirectly on proposals, at least not yet, but it provides information on how to\nvote as well as information regarding upcoming, current, and past proposals (and\ntheir voting results).\n\nThis is currently just a concept, and Particl Desktop Lead Developer Arnold\nBansemer is currently looking into the feasibility of implementing this feature.\n\nMarketplace Orders Export Functionality\nAdding a CSV export tool for orders from the Market > Sell > Orders page is\ncurrently being explored. This would enable sellers to export useful order\ninformation that might benefit from being fed into other stock systems.\n\nThis is currently just a concept and was a requested feature from some community\nmembers.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nDelete a Product From the Inventory\nThis will let you delete products from your inventory if you don’t want them to\nbe displayed anymore. This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end\nspecific change.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of the above considerations, you can now expect the new testnet build\nfor Particl V3 to go live early next week. We will need all hands on deck to\ntest it out to ensure no further issues are introduced by the wide range of\nfixes this build contains.\n\nAdditionally, and as always, we invite you to post your comments, suggestions,\nfeedback, and any bug you may find on the Issues page for Particl Desktop on\nGithub [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nIn the meantime, make sure to cast your vote in the currently ongoing voting\nperiod for CCS Proposal #7. Simply follow this link\n[https://particl.news/delegated-output-management-proposal-is-live/] for all the\ndetails on how to vote.\n\nFinally, we once again want to thank you all for your continued support and\ndedication to Particl’s vision!

All the information is readily provided right from the app within\na user-friendly process.\nHow to Vote\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/]While it's already\npossible to vote for this proposal, votes will only start being counted starting\nfrom block 936,128. Regardless, it's highly recommended to set up your node to\nvote for this proposal right now. \n\nThat's because each proposal has a quorum requirement of 20%, meaning 20% of all\nthe blocks within the voting period need to be voting for or against the\nproposal for it to be valid.

It highlights all the progress that has been made\nover the development of Particl V3 and indicates what are the items that are\ngoing to be focused on next week and beyond.\n\nSince our last progress report, several issues have been resolved while others\nhave progressed well. As Particl’s Lead Desktop Developer Arnold Bansemer has\nbeen working on the list of outstanding issues, some minor issues that need to\nbe fixed have been identified. Additionally, documents containing popular\ncommunity requests and suggestions have been re-visited, and a couple of extra\nitems have been implemented as a result.\n\nWithout further ado, here is a list of the items currently in progress and those\nremaining.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\nIn Progress\nExternal Links\nAllow external links to be rendered in the user's browser, rather than opening a\nnew webview app-based window. This is a Particl Desktop specific change.\n\nFlagging Markets\nFlagging markets (markets that the user has either flagged or voted on to\nremove) prevents the processing of activities that the flagged market impacts.\nExamples are attempting to remove the market, editing categories on the market,\nor creating and editing listings for that market.\n\nSome of the issues that were previously causing problems have been fixed.\nHowever, there are still issues that need to be fixed up. This is a market\nback-end specific change.\n\nExpired Listings\nExpired listings that are still in a cart should not be removed when the MP\nroutine to clean up expired listings automatically is run. This is a market\nback-end specific change that’s completed and only requires to be merged.\n\nTo Be Completed\nThe following items are placed in the order that they are planned to be worked\non.\n\nOrders Getting Stuck in Shipping Phase\nIn the buy flow, releasing funds to complete the buy flow for an item before a\npossible shipping message has been received results in the order status becoming\nstuck in the 'Shipping' state despite being complete. This is a market back-end\nspecific change that is likely already fixed but requires a bit more testing.\n\nMiscellaneous Client Startup Issue\nHad a report that starting the client with a locked wallet results in some\nstartup issues (unlocking the wallet and starting the market app again appears\nto have fixed it). This is a Particl Desktop specific fix, and it still requires\nfurther investigation.\n\nDynamic Quotations\nThis is not a bug but an intended addition to Particl V3. Add dynamic quotations\ninto the Particl Desktop startup splash screen. This is a Particl Desktop\nspecific change.\n\nWindows Startup Bug\nA zmq.node error causes startup issues for some Windows users. The issue makes\nlaunching and properly using Particl V3 impossible for these users. This is a\nParticl Desktop specific change.\n\nDelete a Product From the Inventory\nThis is not a bug but an intended addition to Particl V3. This will let you\ndelete products from your inventory if you don’t want them to be displayed\nanymore. This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end specific change.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce at least all the above items, except the last two (the Windows issue and\nthe product deletion), are complete, we should be ready to release the next\ntestnet release candidate for Particl V3.\n\nIn the meantime, don’t miss Particl’s upcoming CCS votes for the election of\noutput claim managers and the introduction of a new decentralized treasury\nmodel. The first vote is going to take place on Wednesday, the 12th of May,\n2021. You can find the details of the proposal here.\n[https://particl.news/delegated-output-claim-management-proposal/]\n\nAs always, we want to thank you for your continued support!

This shift aims at putting you, every\ncommunity member, into a more important position of power over what happens with\nthe project.\n\nAs such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing\nhow the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain\nvoting tool and the CCS proposal system.\n\nThe on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the\nblockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on\nthe CCS.\n\nIf you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the\nParticl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on\nby the community.\n\nFor all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in\nwith the CCS system, check out this blog post available on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/].\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]To\nempower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance\nmodel, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model\nthat could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.\n\nThis decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in\nthe coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to\n8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other\n50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.\n\nThe Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft\nproposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit\nthe Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the\ntreasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the\non-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.\n\nIn May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post\nexplaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds\nfrom the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose,\nand so on.

Indeed,\ncreated out of firm community feedback, the Delegated Output Claim Management\nProposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7] suggests nominating a\ngroup composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate\nindividual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. \n\nOnce validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one\ncomposed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This\nsecond group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no\nclaim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.\n\nIt seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire\nmethod to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon\nthe assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.\n\nThis proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for\nvoting in the next few days.

Not only will it provide more\nresilience against the power exchanges hold over Particl, but it’ll also make\nacquiring PART easier, more accessible, and entirely anonymous. An integration\nof BasicSwap into Particl Desktop is planned and is currently in progress (more\ndetails on that in a later Particl News blog post).\n\nAs development continues, BasicSwap will soon be opened for testing as a public\nbeta.

This shift aims at putting you, every community member, into a more important position of power over what happens with the project.</p><p>As such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing how the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain voting tool and the CCS proposal system.</p><p>The on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the blockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on the CCS.</p><p>If you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the Particl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on by the community.</p><p>For all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in with the CCS system, check out <a href=\"https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/\"><strong>this blog post available on Particl News</strong></a>.</p><h1 id=\"decentralized-treasury-model\">Decentralized Treasury Model</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about the new CCS proposal to form a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Blog</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/d61e2b944bf46e43f071527ffeff4776/medium-particl-treasury.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>To empower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance model, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model that could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.</p><p>This decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in the coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to 8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other 50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.</p><p>The Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft proposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the treasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the on-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.</p><p>In May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post explaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds from the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose, and so on. Keep your eyes peeled on Particl News for when that blog post lands.</p><h1 id=\"first-proposal-to-require-a-vote-now-live-on-the-ccs\">First Proposal to Require a Vote Now Live on the CCS</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Delegated Output Claim Management by cryptoguard · Pull Request #7 · particl/ccs-proposals</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">SummaryThis proposal is to implement a streamlined and more efficient way to process manual output claims and reactivate temporarily disabled anon and blind balances.RationaleOn the 25th of Febr...</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">GitHub</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">particl</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/66eab0d12a30e80e5fdcaf52f7abca9b7074708cbeaf6ea0405b6aa1809cb505/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7\"></div></a></figure><p>April also saw the first CCS proposal ever to require an on-chain community vote to be activated. Indeed, created out of firm community feedback, the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7\">Delegated Output Claim Management Proposal</a> suggests nominating a group composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate individual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. </p><p>Once validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one composed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This second group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no claim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.</p><p>It seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire method to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon the assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.</p><p>This proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for voting in the next few days.

These are the output claim management proposal and the one to enable\na brand new, powerful treasury model.\n\nThat’s directly in line with our recent efforts to put more focus on community\ngovernance and improve the degree of decentralization of the project. This now\nputs you in a much more influential position.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to reveal all the details and parameters of this on-chain\nand entirely decentralized voting mechanism.\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * CCS Proposals\n * On-Chain Voting\n * Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n   [/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus]\n * Potential Voting Outcomes\n * Proposal Lifecycle\n * Community Fund\n * First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCCS Proposals\nAs explained, in detail, in the introductory blog post of the CCS\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982/], anyone\ncan submit proposals on the CCS to request donations for initiatives from the\ncommunity. The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level\nof decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain\nvoting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that\nmission.\n\nOn-Chain Voting\nThe on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can\nnow use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network\nvote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for\nproposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can\nbe used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!\n\nThe voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote\nevery time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a\nstake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from\naffecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their\ncoins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the\nsame time.\n\nThe main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting\nsystem that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With\nthis system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on\nthe blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without\nany risk of tampering.\n\nIt's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of\nall the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins\na pool contains, the more voting power it has.\n\n> Note: For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within\nthe voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (< 1,000 PART), it is\nlikely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.\nApproval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n\nFor a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three\nrequirements to fill. They are the quorum requirement, the approval rate, and\nthe minimum duration of the voting process. The quorum requirement is determined\nby what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The\napproval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a\nproposal.\n\nProposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each\none with its own value requirements.\n\nNon Protocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 60% in favor\n * Duration: 5,040 blocks minimum\n\nNon protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in\nthe protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from\nthe Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular\ninitiative.\n\nFor a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must\nbe a minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). Within that period, 20% of the\nblocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That\nmeans the quorum has to be at least 20%. Finally, to be considered as approved\nby the community, it needs to reach an approval rate of at least 60%, meaning at\nleast 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed\nidea.\n\nProtocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 75% in favor\n * Duration: 10,080 blocks minimum\n\nProtocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more\nsignificant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a\nspecific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a\ndecentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain,\nintroducing a new privacy technology, etc.\n\nJust like non protocol consensus votes, their quorum requirement stands at 20%.\nBut because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they\nrequire a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required \napproval rate has to be at least 75%. Finally, the duration of any protocol\nconsensus vote has to be a minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks) to give\nample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.\n\nPotential Voting Outcomes\nThere are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their\nrespective outcome.\n\n * If quorum is not met, the proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the\n   proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the\n   proposal is APPROVED ✅\n * If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target\n   approval rate, the proposal expires and is REJECTED ❌\n\nProposal Lifecycle\nBelow is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require\na vote.\n\n * A proposal is submitted on the CCS. Click here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/] to see how to submit your own proposal.\n * The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a\n   vote or not.\n * The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.\n * Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting\n   does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in\n   response to community feedback.\n * If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on\n   the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator\n   may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly\n   viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS\n   administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the\n   proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting\n   on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes\n   voting on the proposal.\n * The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then\n   assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).\n * The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the\n   administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.\n * When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected.\n   This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.\n * When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin.\n   The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the\n   milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.\n\nCommunity Fund\nInsightParticl Insight.

Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that\nfunding was through community donations.\n\nWith the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the \nCommunity Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM] to help\nyou realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART\nholders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.\n\nIndeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is\ngoing to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is\ncraft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in\ndetail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl\ncommunity to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.\n\nFirst Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!\nYou won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this \nWednesday (28th of April, 2021), we will publish the first-ever proposal to\nrequire the use of the on-chain voting system.\n\nThis proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate\nthe Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze\nall legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of\nthe emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be\nre-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS\non Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few\nproposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the\npower of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project,\nbusiness, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have\nall the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!\n\nThis addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and\nshould lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t\nforget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community\nFund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will\ngrow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous\npotential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with\nthese resources!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level of decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain voting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that mission.</p><h1 id=\"on-chain-voting\">On-Chain Voting</h1><p>The on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can now use to let your voice be heard.

The most common use for network votes will be for proposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can be used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!</p><p>The voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote every time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a stake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from affecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their coins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the same time.</p><p>The main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting system that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With this system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on the blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without any risk of tampering.</p><p>It's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of all the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote.

Core 0.19.2.6 and \nParticl Desktop 2.3.6. These releases aim to ease and streamline the process of\nidentifying anon and blind outputs to assist the team in selecting the best path\nforward and help reveal exploited outputs that can then be blacklisted.\n\nBelow this post, you’ll find a detailed progress report for Particl V3. If you\nwant to jump straight to it, you can click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 and Particl Core 0.19.2.6\nRelease Particl Desktop v2.3.6 · particl/particl-desktopThis patch release\nincludes some minor usability enhancements.NB!! The source code linked to here\nis not the actual tagged release source code. Please contact Particl for source\ncode information. ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6] * Desktop\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\n * Core\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 introduces a new GUI tool to quickly identify the anon and\nblind outputs from all your unlocked wallets. It uses the new Particl Core\n0.19.2.6 release, which improves the output tracing script.\n\nTo see the complete list of changes for Particl Core 0.19.2.6, follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/branch_0.19.2.6/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01926]\n.\n\nTo use the new tool, simply follow these steps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1- Open Particl Desktop 2.3.6 and ensure you are running Particl Core 0.19.2.6.\n\n2- Unlock all of your wallets by opening each of them in the bar on the left and\nclicking the lock pad icon at the top right corner of the client.\n\n3- Once all your wallets are unlocked, click on the printer icon at the top\nright corner of the client and a new window will appear.\n\n4- Choose where you want to export your output data, and then click on the \nExport button.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter clicking the Export button, a file named frozen_blinded_data.txt will be\ncreated in the location of your choice.

You shouldn’t need to download the new Particl Core\nversion separately unless you want to collect your outputs without using Particl\nDesktop.\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nWe are happy today to also provide a detailed Particl V3 progress report. This\nlist contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last\nParticl V3 progress report.\n\nAdditionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of\nParticl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved.\nThe development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.\n\nTo-Do\nA list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet.\nSome of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the\nothers are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some\nWindows users.\n\n * Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any\n   related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product\n   templates for the market cannot be created, etc. The fix has been implemented\n   and is currently in testing phase.\n * An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically\n   removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. The fix has\n   been implemented and is currently in testing phase.\n * A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing\n   the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the\n   “shipping step”. The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing\n   phase.\n * Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace\n   does not work as expected. The fix has been implemented and is currently in\n   testing phase.\n * The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the\n   implementation of selecting a category during the product template\n   creation/editing.\n * Fix the zmq.node error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.\n * Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the\n   user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are\n   some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better\n   solution can be implemented.\n * Add dynamic loading screen quotations.\n * There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.\n * Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the\n   category creation process after creating a new storefront market.\n * Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no\n   confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if\n   the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is\n   promoted.\n\nIn Progress\nA list of items currently being worked on.\n\n * Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API\n   improvements applied in particl-market. Needs some significant testing to\n   ensure all things are working, so takes a non-trivial amount of time to\n   complete.\n * In the wallet module, the Address label is not clearly indicated that it\n   requires additional action (clicking the button) to save the label.\n * Test Particl Core 0.19.2.6 with Particl Desktop 3.0, fixing any issues that\n   may occur.\n\nCompleted\nA list of the items that have been completed since the last Particl V3 progress\nreport.\n\n * Add 32-bit Windows builds back in as before.\n * Setting all shipping costs to 0 causes some errors while publishing a product\n   and purchasing.\n * On the listings page, add a checkbox-like control to each item to avoid\n   confusion about unselecting a selected country.\n * Allow for the transaction ID to be selected/copied in the Transaction table.\n * Ensure the 'Show inactive and archived' checkbox in the Orders pages is\n   checked/enabled by default to prevent orders from seemingly disappearing once\n   they are complete.\n * Fixed an error that appeared when the Particl Desktop application is closed\n   while the marketplace is starting.\n * A menu dropdown with no additional identities for selection now indicates no\n   alternative identities for selection (rather than displaying nothing).\n * Presents a missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when creating a market with an\n   encrypted wallet/identity.\n * Display an alternative error message when accepting a bid fails due to having\n   insufficient available funds.\n * Swap the position of the public and anon balance values in the Market\n   Overview display.\n * Updated a setting description to describe its intended purpose more\n   accurately.\n\nETA\nDue to the recent inflationary bug, all anon and blind outputs are temporarily\nfrozen. And because the Particl Marketplace works using anon and blind outputs,\nit is not operational until the upcoming hardfork that unfreezes outputs occurs.\n\nFor this reason, a mainnet release of Particl V3 is not possible until the\nhardfork. In the meantime, you can expect one or more testnet releases of\nParticl V3 to properly test all the new bug fixes and improvements made to it\nsince the first testnet release.\n\nIf the mainnet release is entirely ready before the hardfork takes place, the\nteam will start working on additional Particl Desktop deliverables/features in a\nseparate branch which may, or may not, be merged in time for the first V3\nmainnet release. If a feature has been started and is not ready for release when\nthe hardfork takes place, it’ll then be included in a subsequent release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

For example, the market cannot be removed, product templates for the market cannot be created, etc. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the “shipping step”. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace does not work as expected.<strong> The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the implementation of selecting a category during the product template creation/editing.</li><li>Fix the <code class=\"language-text\">zmq.node</code> error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.</li><li>Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better solution can be implemented.</li><li>Add dynamic loading screen quotations.</li><li>There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.</li><li>Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the category creation process after creating a new storefront market.</li><li>Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is promoted.</li></ul><h3 id=\"in-progress\">In Progress</h3><p>A list of items currently being worked on.</p><ul><li>Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API improvements applied in particl-market.
