As I said, the queue I can see in my order book is cleared on my end and\nnow awaiting buyers to actually purchase the items and put it into “Escrow”.\nIn this Alpha version of the Particl Marketplace all bids last 48 hours.

This\nhas given Tecnovert, Core Developer, enough time to work on a little surprise\nwhich has been a very popular request from the community for a long time.\n\nThis surprise can now be revealed! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swaps Live on Mainnet\nOn the 15th of September 2020, the first ever Monero to Particl atomic swap was\nsuccessfully completed on mainnet.\n\n * Particl's xmrswap repository: https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/\n * Transaction: \n   https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30\n\nMonero — Particl Atomic Swap | Particl Insight\n[https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30]\nParticl Insight.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop. Here’s one!\n\nTake note that this mock up is purely a work-in-progress and would most\ndefinitely look a bit different when it’ll be ready for release. It does,\nhowever, gives a good visual representation of how it may look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis news announcement is only part of some more major announcements coming\nsoon. Yes, it’s been a long road to the launch of V3, but it’s given the time\nfor the Particl team to prepare very exciting stuff for the “after-V3” era.\n\nStay tuned, the best is yet to come!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Monero-and-Particl-Atomic-Swaps/1-lx6zvR-f6pN7G9RmKx9otw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"swap-part-and-xmr-on-mainnet-without-any-3rd-party-\">Swap PART and XMR on Mainnet Without Any 3rd Party ?</h3><p>As we head towards the long-awaited <a href=\"https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813\"><strong>Particl V3 release</strong></a>, the Particl developers have been wrapping up the last few pieces required for its launch.</p><p>Particl V3 is Particl’s biggest update to date and it introduces a brand new desktop application as well as greatly improved marketplace experience.
