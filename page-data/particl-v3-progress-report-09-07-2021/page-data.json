This means making certain that all changes for the testnet release\n(and, after that, the mainnet release) are merged and included where they need\nto be.\n\nStyling of the New Community Governance Module\nWhile the new governance module is completed in terms of functionality, it's\ncurrently going through a styling phase (UI/UX) which should also be completed\nin the next few days.\n\nNote that the new governance module may have disabled buttons or functions for\nthis coming testnet round if the styling fixes are not completed by the time of\nreleasing the testnet. Regardless, the module will be entirely ready for Particl\nV3's mainnet release.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nBuilding and Releasing the New Particl V3 on Testnet\nThe next item to  be completed is to release Particl V3 on testnet for what\nshould be its final round of community testing.\n\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository.

This is a very important milestone for Particl as the\nhardfork introduces various changes and re-enables the ability to conduct blind\nand anon transactions.\n\nThis blog post will summarize everything brought by the hardfork and provide an\nupdate on the claims submitted by users who had coins temporarily disabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Has Hardforked\nToday, on Monday the 12th of July, 2021, at 17:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain\nhas successfully hardforked. This event officially turns the page on the\nunfortunate exploit on the chain that led to the creation of fraudulent coins\nout of thin air.\n\nFor an overview of the exploit and its disclosure, please head over to this\nParticl News blog post [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/].\nFor a summary of the solutions that have been deployed, please check out this\none [https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\n> Note: If your Particl Core node is not updated to Particl Core 0.19.2.12, then\nit means you are now staking on the wrong chain. Any staking reward earned on\nthe wrong chain won't count on the correct chain, and you won't be able to send\nor receive payments from other people. Updating to Particl Core 0.19.2.12 is\nmandatory.\nBlind and Anon Transactions Re-Enabled\nOne of the two main components of this hardfork is the re-enabling of blind and\nanon transactions. In addition, the hardfork also re-enables the majority of\nanon and blind balances that were temporarily disabled to stop the attacker from\ncausing further damage on the blockchain.\n\nIn other words, you can now freely make blind and anon transactions once again\nand use Particl Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2. The hardfork also enables\nParticl V3 to go live on mainnnet as it relies on blind and anon transactions.\nMore details on this very soon!\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Low Pass Filter\nIf you had coins on blind and/or anon balances when the vulnerability was\nannounced and fixed, then they have been temporarily disabled up until today. To\nre-enable them, the Particl team deployed a “low pass filter” which\nautomatically re-enables any output with 200 or fewer coins.\n\nTo re-enable temporarily disabled coins using the low pass filter, you will need\nto enter the following command, once for every disabled output, in your Particl\nclient’s debug window.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 220 disabled coins separated into two 110 PART outputs,\nyou will need to enter the above command twice in a row. You need to use Particl\nCore 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Manual Claim Process\nIf you have disabled blind and anon outputs that contain more than 200 coins,\nyou were required to manually submit a claim to the team to include it in the\nwhitelist. If that’s your case, and you’ve submitted a claim, then your outputs\nhave been whitelisted, and you can now spend them. To do just that, you will\nneed to follow the same step as with the low pass filter.\n\nFor every disabled output you have, you need to type in the following command.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 1,000 coins that are currently disabled, spread into 4\noutputs of 250 PART each, you will need to type the above command 4 times. You\nneed to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nManual Claim Process Update\nTo be as transparent as possible, we’d like to provide a full update on the\nmanual claim process and its impact on Particl’s circulating supply.\n\nThroughout the entire span of the claim process, a total of 12 claims have been\nsubmitted to the team. Each claim has been thoroughly inspected and audited. We\nare happy to say that all submitted claims appear legitimate and that none of\nthem traced back to fraudulent or suspicious outputs. The submitted claims\neither traced back to their public origin, were accompanied by a proof of\npurchase, or had the typical cryptography one would expect from legitimate\noutputs.\n\nFor this reason, all claims been approved by both the team and the community\ngroup of validators. This claim process results in an additional\n810,588.43967605 PART being added to the supply, bringing it to a current total\nof ~11,411,000 PART. This doesn’t take any coin re-enabled through the low pass\nfilter into account.\n\n> Note: Particl’s block explorer [https://explorer.particl.io/status] currently\ndisplays a smaller circulating supply value than what is stated above. That’s\nbecause it doesn’t see disabled coins from users who haven’t yet executed the\ncommand to re-enable them. Every time users manually re-enable their coins, the\nblock explorer will dynamically adjust its circulating supply value.\nNew Treasury Model is Live\nThe second principal component of this hardfork is the activation of Particl’s\nnew and decentralized treasury model, which provides the ecosystem with\nperpetual PART revenue. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/] for more details.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]As a\nresult of this successful hardfork, anyone can now submit funding requests on\nParticl’s CCS platform to fund and support initiatives that directly benefit the\necosystem. Any funding request has to be approved by Particl stakeholders\nthrough an on-chain vote for the funds to be allocated from the treasury.\n\nIf you want to submit a proposal, please head over to the CCS platform\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] and read the instructions provided on there.\n\nIncrease in Staking Rewards\nAs part of the new treasury model, staking rewards are also getting a bump.\nIndeed, as of today, Particl’s emission rate has increased from 2% per year to\n8%, with half of the rewards going directly into the Treasury Fund.\n\nThat means that, as an individual staker, your staking rewards double from 2%\nper year to a minimum of 4%. But, of course, the actual yield rewarded to you\nfrom staking PART varies depending on how many more PART coins are being staked\nby other people. If, for example, only 50% of all PART coins stake on the\nnetwork, then you can expect your annual returns to be closer to 8% than 4%. You\ncan use CryptoID’s useful extraction tool\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!extraction] to track the percentage of all\nPART coins being staked by their owner.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would like to thank you all for your incredible support and\nunderstanding through this challenging series of events. As we officially turn\nthe page on the vulnerability exploit with the hardfork, the team is excited to\nmove forward once again and spend its time growing and promoting the Particl\necosystem.\n\nStay tuned as we near the mainnet release of Particl V3 and soon release a bunch\nof exciting news, including the new roadmap, on Particl News.\n\nWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and that’s precisely the case here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

If that's the\ncase, there is nothing more for you to do, you're already all set!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s this Hardfork About?\nThis coming hardfork, scheduled for the 12th of July, 2021 at 17:00 UTC and\nactivated by Particl Core 0.19.2.12, has two primary purposes.\n\nRe-Enabling Temporarily Disabled Anon and Blind Balances\nParticl Vulnerability DisclosureLearn everything about Particl’s recent\nvulnerability discovery and emergency hardfork.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]The Particl team\nnoticed, in February 2021, a discrepancy between the expected and the observed\nsupply. Indeed, it was found that there were more coins in circulation than\nthere should.\n\nThe team immediately investigated the situation and discovered that an attacker\nhad exploited the chain. This allowed a hacker to create a certain number of\ncoins out of thin air to sell them on the trading markets. The bug that made\nthis possible was located and fixed in an emergency hardfork, leading to anon\nand blind balances being temporarily disabled.\n\nThe hardfork re-enables legitimate anon and blind balances while keeping\nexploited ones disabled.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model Activation\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]\nAdditionally, the Particl community recently approved a new treasury model to\nprovide the ecosystem with a decentralized and perpetual source of PART income.\nThis allows anyone to create and publish proposals on the CCS platform and get\ntheir initiative(s) funded if approved by the community through an on-chain\nvote.\n\nThe hardfork activates this new treasury model live on mainnet.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and land on the proper chain, all\nyou need to do is update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.12 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212Hashes8381f9a3f00c4515c32f87d9a66cc04ce3de2ad1aad95171e7c4cd99d91b46dc\nparticl-0.19.2.12-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] * Download\n   link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12\n\nThis version is already live, as a full release, and you can download it\ndirectly on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If you are\ncold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, simply enter\nthis command to update your node: cd ~/partyman && ./partyman update.\n\nOnce you’ve updated your node, you don’t need to do anything else. You’ll\nhardfork on the 12th of July, at 17:00 UTC, with the rest of the network. The\nhardfork is an entirely automatic process as long as you’re running the correct\ncore version.\n\nAnything Else Included in the Hardfork?\nThe two main items of this hardfork have been detailed in the first section of\nthis blog post, after the introduction. However, a few other minor items are\nincluded, which are available in the release notes of Particl Core 0.19.2.12.\nYou can simply follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212] \nto get the full list of additions included in this release.\n\nMaking Particl V3’s Mainnet Release Possible\nAn important but indirect result of this hardfork is that it will make the\nmainnet release of Particl V3 possible. Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on\nmainnet up until the hardfork.\n\nThat’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client,\nuses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling\nescrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind\nbalances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.\n\nAs the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and\nthus able to be released on mainnet.\n\nAs an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one\nweek after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3\nrelease ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as\nsmoothly as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and\nwants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through\nthis unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are\nincredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the\nParticl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.\n\nFollowing the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new\npost-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the\necosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.\n\nWe cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized\ne-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience! So stay awesome, and let’s rock the\nmonths and years to come, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
