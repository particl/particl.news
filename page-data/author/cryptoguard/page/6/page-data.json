You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nExploring New Coin Additions ?\nThis week, we've continued the process of exploring new coins for inclusion on\nBasicSwap and started working on a few integrations.\n\nIn the process, we've encountered unique challenges that necessitated\nimprovements to the BasicSwap codebase. Inded, while the Particl blockchain can\ninterpret transactions from various coins, the reverse isn't always true for\nsome of the coins we're aiming to integrate. Given that BasicSwap was initially\ndesigned for a swift launch with the initial coin release lineup we had at that\ntime, certain assets we're considering now aren't fully compatible with specific\naspects of the existing codebase. \n\nConsequently, we've now opted to embed additional functionalities directly into\nBasicSwap to ensure broader cryptocurrency compatibility moving forward. While\nthese modifications aren't too extensive or expected to become time-consuming,\nthey have been a focal point of our work this week.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nIn addition to the minor cosmetic updates highlighted in last week's report, \nwe've begun refining the New Offer page. Our aim is to streamline the user\nexperience by tucking most advanced options into a collapsible menu and focusing\ninstead on what coins, and what amounts, users want to swap. \n\nThis approach ensures a quicker and more intuitive interface, preventing users\nfrom being overwhelmed by technical choices. However, these options remain\neasily accessible for advanced users who seek them.\n\nPrepare Your Nodes, Voting Starts Tuesday ?️ \nTeam Funding Proposal #4Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fourth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-4/]Last week, we have published a\nfourth funding request to ensure the continued growth of the Particl project and\nto support the wide-ranging operations of the team.\n\nWe can now announce that voting will start next Tuesday and last from block \n1,493,000 to block 1,498,039, for a total of 5,040 blocks.\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it will require\na participation rate of 20% or more of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\n> Note: The accompanying CCS page of the proposal should be up in the next couple\nof hours, after which we'll publish a standalone blog post announcing the voting\nparameters and instructions on Particl News.\nHow to Vote ℹ️\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_governance.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n * For the CCS voting page of this proposal, head over here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-4.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.

Since then, we've made substantial\nstrides across all aspects of the Particl ecosystem, particularly in regards to\nBasicSwap DEX, our latest privacy-first and pro-liberty dApp.\n\nHere's a snapshot of our accomplishments and noteworthy news since the\ninitiation of the third funding cycle.\n\n * Publication of Particl’s whitepaper (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-whitepaper-published/])\n * Launch of BasicSwap’s open beta (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/])\n * Multiple subsequent BasicSwap GUI updates (1\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-available/], 2\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui2-0-1-available/], 3\n   [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/])\n * Deployment of rudimentary BSX liquidity and market making tool (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/])\n * Particl Desktop 3.3 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-mainnet/] and \n   3.3.1 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-1-now-available/]\n * 9 Particl Core releases (1 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases]\n   , 2 [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Core 25.x latest version (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-core-25rc1-released/])\n * Attended and gave presentations at Monerotopia\n   [https://staging.particl.news/basicswap-monerotopia-presentation/]\n   [https://particl.news/particl-goes-to-monerotopia/] and Monerokon\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-talk-at-monerokon/]\n * New BasicSwap.com [https://basicswap.com] website and upcoming Particl.io\n   [https://particl.io] revamp\n * Breakthrough bidirectional Monero atomic swaps (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n   )\n * PART added to the mobile Stack Wallet (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/])\n * Particl blockchain’s yearly coin emission rate reduced (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/part-coin-emission-rate-reduced/])\n\nItems in Progress and Current Main Priorities\nIn addition to the aforementioned completed milestones, we’re currently actively\nworking on a couple of major items that align with Particl's ultimate vision.\nOur objective is to complete or make major progress on these during the\nforthcoming funding cycle while simultaneously working on various smaller\ndeliverables.\n\n * Getting PART listed on better exchanges to ease access into the ecosystem and\n   improve general market health\n * Web framework and integration layer for BasicSwap DEX and Particl Marketplace\n * Seller app (Particl Marketplace)\n * Messaging layer agnosticism for BasicSwap DEX\n * New coin integrations into BasicSwap\n * SMSG 2.0 (still in research phase, not in active development)\n\n> Note: Just like any roadmap or medium-term planning, modifications to our plans\nmay occur due to a variety of factors, such as, among others, emerging\nopportunities and changes in funding scenarios or team composition adjustments.\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 12 months\n\nThis funding request proposes a monthly claim of 35,250 PART from the Treasury\nFund for a 12-month period to support the Particl team and fund its operations.\nFollowing the end of this period, the proposal will need to be renewed and\nreceive the approval of Particl stakeholders once again to claim further funds.\n\nAs with the previous proposal, the team has chosen to claim funds for an entire\nyear to ensure steady support for current endeavors and ease the logistics\nassociated with potential external funding possibilities and hiring processes.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to enhance the\necosystem and its dApps. An example of such endeavour was Particl's recent\nparticipation at both Monerotopia and Monerokon a few months ago.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nRegarding External Funding\nThe Particl team is exploring several external funding options and is\ncontinuously assessing various proposals we receive related to third-party\nmarket liquidity or capital injections. This aims to supplement the funds drawn\nfrom the network's treasury by either providing non-PART funds to the team or\nbuilding a healthier PART landscape and a more liquid market environment for\neveryone.\n\nWhile we remain flexible and open to innovative solutions in this aspect, we are\nacutely aware of any potential impacts such initiatives could have on the\nproject, market, and community. Thus, we're taking a cautious and deliberate\napproach, and cannot provide any guarantees regarding the outcomes of these\ninitiatives if none ultimately prove beneficial to the project and its\ncommunity.\n\n> Note: This proposal has been created under the assumption that no external funds\nwill be raised, and it is sufficient to cover the team’s fundamental ongoing\nexpenses\nHow to Vote\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running the latest version of\nPartyman.

This aims to supplement the funds drawn from the network's treasury by either providing non-PART funds to the team or building a healthier PART landscape and a more liquid market environment for everyone.</p><p>While we remain flexible and open to innovative solutions in this aspect, we are acutely aware of any potential impacts such initiatives could have on the project, market, and community. Thus, we're taking a cautious and deliberate approach, and cannot provide any guarantees regarding the outcomes of these initiatives if none ultimately prove beneficial to the project and its community.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>This proposal has been created under the assumption that no external funds will be raised, and it is sufficient to cover the team’s fundamental ongoing expenses</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"how-to-vote\">How to Vote</h2><p>To cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold staking application and register your vote on the blockchain for <code class=\"language-text\">proposal #19</code>. </p><p>You have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).

in May 2023, we traveled to Mexico City as the BasicSwap team to attend\nMonerotopia 2023. For this edition of the Monero-centric conference, they've\ndecided to welcome various privacy-focused cryptocurrency and blockchain\nprojects. There, we not only hosted a booth and forged valuable connections, but\nalso presented, on the event's main stage, BasicSwap DEX, its mission, story,\nand role within the broader privacy subset of the cryptocurrency economy.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce that the presentation is now officially\navailable on MoneroTalk's Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/@MoneroTalk/videos], and that you can finally watch it\nfrom home!\n\nTry BasicSwap DEX Today\nBasicSwap DEX's open beta is live and you can use it today! All you need to do\nis follow the instructions either on its section of the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html]\n, or from the Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEZ-a00uSM&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfxAswJnqlh_KbHvWCUFqFVF]\n.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's Order BookWhat Happened Since This Presentation\nSince this presentation, we've been hard at work improving BasicSwap's core tech\nand elevating its user experience. \n\nFirstly, we've introduced a basic liquidity providing / market making tool\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-liquidity-script/] that anyone can deploy and\noperate from home. While it falls short of any advanced feature, such as what\nwould be possible via something like a Hummingbot integration, it enables more\nautomated and logic-based management of your liquidity and offers. Of course, we\nplan on much more all-emcompassing solutions moving forward; this is merely the\nfirst initial step towards more comprehensive solutions in the future.\n\nWe've also pursued our work on implementing a series of user interface\nimprovements [https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/],\nsimplifying and refining the end-user experience. These updates have also\nsignificantly streamlined the code, enhancing the app's efficiency.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most notably since the Monerotopia presentation, we've\nadded the long-awaited bidirectional atomic swap functionality for Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. As explained in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, Monero atomic swaps, despite their groundbreaking nature, were previously\nlimited by a significant technical constraint: offers could only request Monero,\nnot offer it for other cryptocurrencies, leading to a 'one-way swapping only'\nscenario.\n\nOur latest update addresses this limitation, enabling 'two-way' Monero swapping \nor, in other words, allowing you to offer Monero when creating swap offers on\nBasicSwap's order book. While this clever workaround, made possible by the SMSG\nnetwork, doesn't resolve the technical limitation at the protocol level, it does\nso at the end-user level, making the user experience seamless with no additional\nsteps, fees, or encumbrances.\n\nThis development positions atomic swap-based Monero DEXs like BasicSwap as a\nviable alternative to data-hungry and oftentimes straight up irresponsible\ncentralized exchanges. It significantly enhances the resilience of Monero and\nPART (Anon) to external attacks and censorship campaigns.\n\nWhat's Next for BasicSwap DEX? \nWith the successful launch of the major bidirectional Monero atomic swap update,\nour attention, in regards to BasicSwap, is now concentrated on three key areas.\n\nFirstly, we are actively exploring the addition of more cryptocurrencies to the\nplatform. Though we've had to postpone this expansion to prioritize core aspects\nof the DEX, the demand for new additions has remained strong, with many requests\noriginating directly from representatives of projects seeking to be included on\nour platform. Therefore, we are now assessing the integration feasibility of\nseveral coins and hope to add a few of them in the coming weeks, alongside our\nongoing work on other areas.\n\nSecondly, we are in the process of developing a web framework that will enable\nBasicSwap-powered web services to be easily accessed through a web browser. For\nexample, envision web-based exchanges akin to Changelly or ChangeNow, but driven\nby a completely decentralized exchange protocol (BasicSwap). This significant\nadvancement is crucial in making BasicSwap DEX accessible to the wider crypto\ncommunity, including those with less technical expertise. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of this web framework will allow integrations with various\napplications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr.\nKap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl\nMarketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during\ncheckout, while still settling the transaction in PART. This is but one example\nof what can be possible with a web framework built for integrations.\n\nLastly, we are committed to enhancing BasicSwap's scalability. We are\nconsidering two potential solutions for this. The first involves creating what\nwe have temporarily named \"SMSG 2.0\". Although referred to as 2.0, this\ninitiative actually requires constructing a new SMSG-like mixnet from the ground\nup, designed for near-infinite scalability. Though we have a design and some\ninitial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand\nsignificant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative\nmixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of\nincorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap. Depending on the daily\nusage of BasicSwap, a balancing system could distribute the messaging load\nacross all integrated mixnets, thus ensuring the DEX's scalability for early but\nsubstantial adoption.\n\nAnd while we believe strongly in the scalability potential of SMSG 2.0, the\nsystem balancing messaging load across multiple mixnets might remain even after\nits readiness, if it proves effective, as it may further bolster the resiliency\nand decentralization of the DEX.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOf course, the elements we are currently focusing on, including the integration\nof more complex cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap, are substantial and will\nrequire time to fully develop. However, these efforts are paramount to realizing\nour vision of a seamlessly interconnected, privacy-first, and pro-liberty\ndigital economy. Equally important is making this economy as accessible as\npossible, to ensure that it can be embraced by a wide audience.\n\nOnce implemented, these three significant advancements will position BasicSwap\nDEX to challenge traditional centralized exchanges and catalyze the broader\nadoption of a crypto economy that's truly independent of the legacy \"fiat\nsystem\".\n\nIn the interim, we invite you to support BasicSwap by testing its capabilities,\nsharing feedback and comments with us, and adding liquidity to the order book.\nEvery contribution, regardless of its size, plays a vital role in building the\nbrighter future we all strive to achieve.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

While it falls short of any advanced feature, such as what would be possible via something like a Hummingbot integration, it enables more automated and logic-based management of your liquidity and offers. Of course, we plan on much more all-emcompassing solutions moving forward; this is merely the first initial step towards more comprehensive solutions in the future.</p><p>We've also pursued our work on implementing a series of <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/\">user interface improvements</a></strong>, simplifying and refining the end-user experience. These updates have also significantly streamlined the code, enhancing the app's efficiency.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most notably since the Monerotopia presentation, we've added the long-awaited <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/\">bidirectional atomic swap functionality for Monero</a></strong>. As explained in <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\"><strong>this blog post</strong></a>, Monero atomic swaps, despite their groundbreaking nature, were previously limited by a significant technical constraint: offers could only request Monero, not offer it for other cryptocurrencies, leading to a 'one-way swapping only' scenario.</p><p><strong>Our latest update addresses this limitation, enabling 'two-way' Monero swapping </strong>or, in other words, allowing you to offer Monero when creating swap offers on BasicSwap's order book. While this clever workaround, made possible by the SMSG network, doesn't resolve the technical limitation at the protocol level, it does so at the end-user level, making the user experience seamless with no additional steps, fees, or encumbrances.</p><p>This development positions atomic swap-based Monero DEXs like BasicSwap as a viable alternative to data-hungry and oftentimes straight up irresponsible centralized exchanges. It significantly enhances the resilience of Monero and PART (Anon) to external attacks and censorship campaigns.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-for-basicswap-dex\">What's Next for BasicSwap DEX? </h2><p>With the successful launch of the major bidirectional Monero atomic swap update, our attention, in regards to BasicSwap, is now concentrated on three key areas.</p><p>Firstly, we are actively exploring the <strong>addition of more cryptocurrencies to the platform</strong>. Though we've had to postpone this expansion to prioritize core aspects of the DEX, the demand for new additions has remained strong, with many requests originating directly from representatives of projects seeking to be included on our platform. Therefore, we are now assessing the integration feasibility of several coins and hope to add a few of them in the coming weeks, alongside our ongoing work on other areas.</p><p>Secondly, we are in the process of developing a <strong>web framework</strong> that will enable BasicSwap-powered web services to be easily accessed through a web browser. For example, envision web-based exchanges akin to Changelly or ChangeNow, but driven by a completely decentralized exchange protocol (BasicSwap). This significant advancement is crucial in making BasicSwap DEX accessible to the wider crypto community, including those with less technical expertise. Moreover, the development of this web framework will allow integrations with various applications, platforms, or wallets. A prime example, as pointed out in Dr. Kap's presentation at Monerotopia, is the integration of the DEX into Particl Marketplace, which would allow for the use of other cryptocurrencies during checkout, while still settling the transaction in PART. This is but one example of what can be possible with a web framework built for integrations.</p><p>Lastly, we are committed to <strong>enhancing BasicSwap's scalability</strong>. We are considering two potential solutions for this. The first involves creating what we have temporarily named \"<strong>SMSG 2.0</strong>\". Although referred to as 2.0, this initiative actually requires constructing a new SMSG-like mixnet from the ground up, designed for near-infinite scalability. Though we have a design and some initial coding in place, achieving a production-ready level will demand significant time and effort. Therefore, we are also exploring alternative mixnets such as XX Network, Session, Nym, etc., to gauge the possibility of incorporating one or several of them into BasicSwap. Depending on the daily usage of BasicSwap, a balancing system could distribute the messaging load across all integrated mixnets, thus ensuring the DEX's scalability for early but substantial adoption.</p><p>And while we believe strongly in the scalability potential of SMSG 2.0, the system balancing messaging load across multiple mixnets might remain even after its readiness, if it proves effective, as it may further bolster the resiliency and decentralization of the DEX.</p><hr><p>Of course, the elements we are currently focusing on, including the integration of more complex cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap, are substantial and will require time to fully develop.

However, they\nnecessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have\nprogrammable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for\na wide array of coins, but not for Monero.\n\nAs the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important\nfor BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of\nfinancial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital\ncash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom\nactors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.\n\nThat’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed a\nnew Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf]. This breakthrough development, a\nproduct of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years,\nfinally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without\nthe need for programmable outputs.\n\n> Note: For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our\nrecent blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n.\nThe Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps\nWhile the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a\nsignificant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only\noperate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an\natomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer'\nand a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).\n\nThe offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap\nrequest, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder,\nin contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon\nagreement, initiates the swap process.\n\nThe offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested\ncoins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other\nparameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are\nnot specifically pertinent to this article's context.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's order bookDue to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless\natomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more\naccurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This\nstipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable\noutputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being\noffered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.\n\nTo better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which\ndescribes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from\nthe perspective of the 'offerer'.\n\nSee flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\nNote that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin —\na Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the\nMonero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a\nMonero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold\nMonero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else\nrequesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you\nmust create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.\n\nThis restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and\nadds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard\nfunctionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized\ntrading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact\nrate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a\nsolution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages\nenjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.\n\nBidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?\nWe are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero\natomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and\naccessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on\nMonero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request\nAND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.\n\nHow was it Accomplished?\nMonero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct\nconsequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting\ncapabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.\n\nAs such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or\nmaking extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic\nswap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and\ntransaction size management, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements]\n).\n\nInstead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the SMSG\nnetwork\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nwith a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a\nDEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and\nmore accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges.\nTherefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.\n\nLeveraging the SMSG Network\nOn BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order\nbook, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate\nan offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the\nmaker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHowever, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology,\nas we've outlined in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before]\n, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a\ndecentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see \nthis article\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nfor more information on SMSG).\n\nThe SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making\nBasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the\nkey to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.\n\nSimulating Offers Requesting Monero\nOur solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on\nmodifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol.\nInstead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.\n\nIn reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature\nprotocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional.\nHowever, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process —\npowered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be\noffered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the\nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end\nuser and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nRefer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier\nin this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of\nexecuting a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap\nDEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.\n\nSee reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\nFrom this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few\nmore steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without\nnecessitating further human intervention.\n\nIndeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap\ninstead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder. A bid is\nthen constructed from this request and the protocol proceeds as normal, just\nwith the parties transposed.\n\nTechnical Documentation\ndoc: Describe reverse adaptor sig protocol. · tecnovert/basicswap@be46d8aBasic\nAtomic Swap Proof of Concept.

Now, in contrast to the previous setup where Monero could only be\nchosen as the requested coin, you also have the option to offer it when placing\na new offer on the order book.\n\nThere are no extra steps or additional prerequisites involved. However, remember\nthat this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with\nsome additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're\nrequesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just\nlike any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. \n\nTo benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure\nthat your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version. To\ninstall it, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image.\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command.\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build command.\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nIf you're not using the Docker setup, you can follow the Particl Academy's\nstep-by-step update guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nWhat Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\nThe introduction of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps for all symbolizes a\nmonumental step towards establishing a privacy-first, resilient global economy\nthat is fair to all.\n\nIndeed, we've observed a steady increase in aggressive, restrictive measures\ntargeting privacy coins like Particl and Monero in recent years, a trend that\nhas only accelerated in recent weeks. As evidenced by the removal of the\ncryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the\naccessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals\nworldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are\nbeing enforced is only likely to speed up over time.\n\nFurthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial\ncryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or,\nat the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the\nworld, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as\nBasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that\ncryptocurrencies like Monero and truly decentralized and self-custodial\nsolutions like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various\nglobal regulations, are needed.\n\nDecentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\nFortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate\nentirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed\nand serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's\nwidespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its\nsurvival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.\n\nHowever, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing\nchallenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has\nresulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular\ncryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor\nsignature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to\nexecute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant\nbarrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.\n\nThe integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX\nmarks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance\nof today's announcement.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nOf course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance,\nBasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains\nrelatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process\nwith the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher,\nthe resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized\nexchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.\n\nThis fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that\nwill equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading\nplatforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness\nBasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without\nhaving to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web\nwallets.\n\nWhile this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of\nbidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for\nthe development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime\nfocus moving forward.\n\nWe encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at Particl News\n[https://particl.news] for updates on this topic.

However, they necessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have programmable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for a wide array of coins, but not for Monero.</p><p>As the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important for BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of financial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital cash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom actors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.</p><p>That’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed <strong><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf\">a new Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures</a></strong>. This breakthrough development, a product of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years, finally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without the need for programmable outputs.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our recent blog post on the topic <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">here</a></strong>.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-big-caveat-to-monero-atomic-swaps\">The Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2><p>While the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a significant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only operate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This stipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable outputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being offered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.</p><p>To better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which describes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from the perspective of the 'offerer'.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png 1264w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Note that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin — a Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the Monero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

However, remember that this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with some additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're requesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just like any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. </p><p>To benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure that your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web.

However, they necessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have programmable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for a wide array of coins, but not for Monero.</p><p>As the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important for BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of financial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital cash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom actors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.</p><p>That’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed <strong><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf\">a new Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures</a></strong>. This breakthrough development, a product of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years, finally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without the need for programmable outputs.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our recent blog post on the topic <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">here</a></strong>.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-big-caveat-to-monero-atomic-swaps\">The Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2><p>While the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a significant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only operate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This stipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable outputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being offered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.</p><p>To better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which describes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from the perspective of the 'offerer'.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-4.png 1264w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Note that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin — a Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the Monero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web.

Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/dev]We've also implemented a few\nminor modifications, notably enhancing the information display during adaptor\nsignature-based swaps. The ITX and PTX states, which previously appeared as\n\"Unknown\", are now accurately displayed. \n\nThis improvement has now been pushed to BasicSwap's dev branch, with additional\nupdates to follow soon, and will soon transition to the master branch, making\nthe update official.\n\nIncreased Focus on New Exchange Listing ?\nThis week, we've been asked about the current efforts to get PART listed in new\nexchanges, and we thought of addressing that in this update.\n\nIn light of Bittrex's current situation, which is less than ideal for many\ncommunity members, we've indeed recently increased our efforts to secure\nlistings on more accessible and popular exchanges.\n\nThe objectives of this initiative are multifaceted. Firstly, we aim to enhance\nthe accessibility of PART for both our community and newcomers. This involves\nideally listing on a KYC-free, unrestricted exchange that operates in a broad\nrange of countries.\n\nSecondly, we seek to establish a reputable trading environment for the PART\ncoin, which will foster improved liquidity and increased volume. This, in turn,\nwill enhance the coin's appeal to external observers and speculators.\n\nAdditionally, securing listings for PART on more popular and widely used\nexchanges paves the way for the coin to be reintroduced to quick swap exchanges\nlike SimpleSwap.io and StealthEX.io. As you may recall, PART was previously\nlisted on these exchanges but was removed when Bittrex began restricting their\nAPI use to service providers.\n\nIn essence, securing listings on better and more widely used exchanges will\nyield net positive outcomes for the project, amplifying the results of our\nmarketing and outreach efforts. While most exchanges enforce NDAs during the\ndiscussion and negotication phase, thus limiting our ability to share ongoing\ndevelopments, we will certainly announce any positive news in that regard as\nsoon as we are able to.\n\nNew Particl Website ✅\nWe're still making good progress on the new website, which we now expect to have\na working version in internal testing in the next couple of days.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay that is impacting\nthe the development process of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nSetup Wizard ?\nGitHub - gerlofvanek/basicswap-Installation-GUIContribute to\ngerlofvanek/basicswap-Installation-GUI development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubgerlofvanek\n[https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-Installation-GUI]Earlier today, we\nreleased a non-compiled version of BasicSwap's setup wizard to our testing\ngroup. Members can now test the wizard and provide feedback on any potential\nissues specific to their operating systems.\n\nAs we finalize the minor details for it, our next step will be to compile it\ninto an .exe launcher for Windows, along with equivalent launchers for other\noperating systems. It's important to note that the initial wizard release will\nnot include an .exe launcher to start BasicSwap after it is installed. However,\nthe inclusion of this feature is planned for a subsequent release.\n\nUser Interface ?️ \nWe've successfully resolved the majority of the bugs present in version 2.0.2 of\nthe user interface and are currently incorporating a few final additions based\non community feedback. Once these changes are implemented, we'll be ready for\nthe official release.\n\nAs highlighted in last week's report, the 2.0.2 user interface and the new setup\nwizard will be launched simultaneously.\n\nCodebase ?\nThose familiar with BasicSwap may be aware that the integration of Monero is\ncurrently partial. As it stands, you can't place offers on the order book\noffering Monero in exchange for other coins. If you possess Monero and want to\nswap it for another currency, you must choose an offer made by another user\nrequesting Monero. That's why the Monero integration may sometimes be referred\nto as working \"one way\".\n\nThis situation is a result of an inherent limitation within Monero's coin\nstructure and its adaptor signature-based swap protocol. However, we're excited\nto announce that we have begun the process of implementing our solution to this\nissue this week, ahead of our presentation at Monerokon. The fix won't be at the\nprotocol level, rather leveraging SMSG and BasicSwap's order book system.\nHowever, from the perspective of the end-user, the outcome will be seamless,\nallowing them to finally swap Monero \"both ways\" — that is, to publish offers on\nthe order book that both offer and request Monero.\n\nWhile we would greatly like to have a basic demo of our solution available by\nnext Friday, when Particl and BasicSwap developer Kewde is scheduled to present\nat Monerokon, we can't make any firm guarantee in that regard. For the time\nbeing, know that we're diligently working to make it a reality, and that we'll\nkeep you up-to-date about progress on that end.\n\nBasicSwap Presenting at Monerokon ?\nA technical conference in privacy and financial technologyA technical\nconference\nin privacy and financial technologyKonferenco2023 [https://monerokon.com/]We are\nthrilled to announce our invitation to deliver a presentation at this year's\nMonerokon conference. The event will be held at the legendary Paralelní Polis\nvenue in Prague from Friday, June 23rd to Sunday, June 25th. You can consult the\nschedule here [https://cfp.monerokon.com/2023/schedule/#].\n\nParticl and BasicSwap developer Kewde will be making a technical presentation on\nBasicSwap, Monero, and their shared usage of adaptor signatures on Friday at\n2:00 PM CET. Definitely an event you won't want to miss if you're around!\n\n> Note: We are eagerly anticipating the release of the speeches recorded at the\nMonerotopia event. \n\nGiven the event's sale of virtual tickets, which enabled people to view the\nspeeches online, the organizers have chosen to delay the public release out of\nrespect for their virtual attendees. \n\nHowever, we have been informed that the process of publishing the speeches\nshould begin shortly.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nSetup Wizard ?\nThis week, our efforts have been focused on finalizing the setup wizard for\nBasicSwap. This tool will facilitate the installation and eventual launching of\nthe DEX via a user-friendly interface. This advancement aligns us with the\nconvenience of a .exe type of executable, essentially enabling you to configure\nand launch BasicSwap without the need to navigate through the command line\ninterface.\n\nThe setup wizard is largely complete, but we are still refining its design and\nthe overall user journey within the GUI. Therefore, we've opted to hold the\nrelease of the v2.0.2 GUI until the setup wizard is ready.\n\nSimultaneously, we have identified and are addressing a few GUI bugs within the\n2.0.2 version of the BasicSwap user interface, and so we're fixing those at the\nsame time.\n\nCodebase ?\nWe've been adding some functions based on user feedback, notably the ability to\nprune data off of your local instance. For example, in the next update, you'll\nbe able to delete past offer and bid history (as long as they are completed).\n\nPlease bear in mind that this enhancement is primarily intended to improve user\nexperience rather than privacy. If an instance were to be scrutinized after data\ndeletion, remnants of previous swaps may still be detected. We plan to introduce\nthorough data pruning in a privacy-conscious manner in the future, as this\nrequires additional development.\n\nFurthermore, we've upgraded the core versions of the Particl and Monero\nblockchains. We highly recommend that you update them to operate the most recent\nversion.\n\nTo update your core, please follow the text-based guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nor watch our Youtube video on the topic here [https://youtu.be/dURSmAtWE6A].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

liquidity-providing\nscript for BasicSwap DEX. This user-friendly script enables you to offer\nliquidity for your preferred trading pairs and set a markup above or below the\nmarket price that lets you benefit from arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the script is designed to automatically republish your offers when\nthey expire, adhering to your predefined pricing strategy. This ensures that\nyour offers consistently reflect the current market rate, plus any additional\npremium you have chosen to apply.\n\n> Note: While this is currently made available as a companion script, we\nanticipate that many of its features will eventually be integrated into\nBasicSwap's core functionality.\nHow to Get Started\nTo get started, simply update your BasicSwap DEX instance. The script is\nincluded in the basicswap/scripts folder.\n\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Academy): \n   https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Youtube): https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ\n\nTo run the script, you’ll need to first edit the JSON template configuration\nfile (template_createoffers.json) included with the update to your liking, then\nrename it to createoffers.json. You can find the instructions on how to properly\nedit that file, as well as all possible variables, here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html] \non the Particl Academy.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Liquidity Tools Guide — Particl Academy latest documentationLearn\nhow to use the liquidity tools available for the BasicSwap DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html]\nOnce that’s done, simply run the script with the command python createoffers.py. \n\n> Note: The script needs to run continuously to be take effect. Closing the\nterminal tab that runs it will terminate it. \n\nFor this reason, we recommend executing the script using Byobu\n[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \nor Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen].\nConsiderations and Recommendations\n * For the script to correctly republish orders and update prices, it must keep\n   on running. Starting to script and then closing the terminal tab will shut it\n   down. As such, we recommend running it with a background task processor, such\n   as Byobu\n   [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \n   or Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen] for example.\n * This script is best used in combination with a cloud-based version of\n   BasicSwap. When combined with a VPS setup, you can then ensure that both your\n   BasicSwap node and your script keep running 24/7, offering a true hands-off\n   approach to liquidity provision. Follow this link\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhRe0WuYgZs&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfxAswJnqlh_KbHvWCUFqFVF&index=10] \n   for a complete video tutorial on how to setup BasicSwap DEX on a cloud.\n * Be mindful that, once a swap completes, your offers are not taken off of the\n   order book. As such, it might not be ideal to set your offers as\n   “auto-accept” if you only intend on making one swap. We have a couple of\n   solutions to give the options to limit the number of swaps per order which\n   will come at a later stage, but for now, it’s important to be aware of this\n   behaviour.\n * Be careful about your configuration file’s formatting. JSON requires you to\n   keep the exact same indentations and logic, so watch out when editing the\n   file.\n * The script defaults to using adaptor signatures, which will cause issues if\n   you’re using a non-Segwit coin on the offering side (i.e., Firo, PIVX). In\n   those cases, make sure to configure the pair to use secret hash swaps by\n   putting \"swap_type\": \"secret_hash\" in the configuration file.\n * If you use the production (isolated) docker setup, you can bundle the script\n   with your BasicSwap launch sequence by adding it to your docker-compose\n   configuration file (\n   https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/docker/production/compose-fragments/8_script.yml\n   ).\n\nBecome a Liquidity Provider!\nLiquidity is fundamental to order book based exchanges, which is why we need\nyour assistance. The first version of this liquidity-providing script makes it\nsimpler than ever to offer liquidity without fees, contributing to BasicSwap's\nsuccess and making swaps that respect our privacy a more viable option for all.\n\nWe appreciate all of your help and thank you for your unwavering support in this\nvital mission for our privacy and liberties!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nEarlier in the week, we pushed the new version of Particl Core to Particl\nDesktop, meaning that your client will now automatically download the most\nrecent version the next time you launch it.\n\nIf your Particl Desktop is currently running, you can trigger the update by\nshutting it down and launching it again.\n\nOther than that, we're still completing the items outlined in our previous\nupdates, namely including enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety\nof minor improvements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay in the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCommits · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]Early in the week, we\nidentified a rare scenario where a malicious user could manipulate the protocol\nto abandon swaps mid-process. While this situation doesn't pose a risk of loss\nof funds, it could adversely affect user experience by leading participants into\nswaps destined to fail. We have promptly fixed this issue.\n\nYou can find the fix, as well as other updates to the BasicSwap protocol,\ndirectly on its Github page here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've made several improvements and tweaks to the user interface, thanks to\nvaluable community feedback, which are ready to go live any day from now. While\nthe merge still hasn't happened, you can expect GUI v2.0.2 to be deployed\nsomewhere next week.\n\nHere are a few notable improvements featured in v2.0.2:\n\n * Enhanced display and usage of swap rates.\n * Tooltips when hovering over specific areas.\n * Enhanced bid-related pages, including the addition of a button to open swap\n   details as opposed to clicking on the bid's hash, improved display of bid and\n   swap statuses, and more.\n * Persistent filters in the order book and bid/offer pages.\n * Improved information display in the \"Create New Offer\" page.\n\nThese updates aim to create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Stay\ntuned for the launch!\n\nCoin Integrations ?\nWe are currently exploring the possibility of introducing new coins to BasicSwap\nin the near future. This initiative is a follow-up to some of our discussions at\nMonerotopia, where we connected with several teams and individuals about\nintegrating their coin or protocol into BasicSwap.\n\nHowever, as each coin integration requires individual attention and can be\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive for all parties involved, we cannot\nprovide specific timelines or commitments at this stage.\n\nAs always, we will take care of informing you as soon as new coins are ready for\ndeployment.\n\nWeb Framework ?\nWe are currently developing a web framework intended to make BasicSwap\naccessible via the web. This is a complex task, as the DEX must be largely\nre-imagined and rebuilt to offer a fitting web experience.\n\nThe deployment of such a platform presents various challenges, both technical\nand user-experience related, that makes it architecturally more intricate, but\nalso more accessible to the end-user, than a local installation.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, the first iteration of a web version of the\nDEX is designed to be more of a quick exchange platform, similar to the\nExodus/SimpleSwap flow type. Our goal is to avoid requiring users to deposit any\ncoins into a persistent web wallet, enhancing both security and usability.\nHowever, due to the nature of atomic swaps, this approach necessitates that swap\ncontracts be pre-signed and that users send coins directly into these contracts.\nThis represents a completely different approach and a more complex flow compared\nto BasicSwap's current local architecture, but it also opens the door to\nfeatures not readily available on a local installation.\n\nFor this reason, we anticipate that the local and web versions of BasicSwap will\ndiverge significantly, each presenting unique advantages, trade-offs, and\nspecific feature sets. This expanded choice aligns with Particl's mission by\nenhancing user flexibility, enabling them to select the platform that most\nclosely aligns with their needs without forcing compromises on the BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol itself. It's the best of both worlds!\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, developing this web framework will take\nconsiderable time, owing to both its development requirements and the need for\nrigourous testing before deployment. \n\nAt the moment, Particl developers Kewde and Tecnovert are working on this task.\nUpdates on its progress may not be regular, but it is now a major focus moving\nforward, so we will ensure you are informed when significant milestones are\nachieved. Your patience and support in this initiative are greatly appreciated;\nwe are convinced that this is a major part of what needs to happen for BasicSwap\nto take off as an end-user product.\n\nUpcoming Overhaul of Particl.io ?\nAs noted in some of our previous progress updates, we're also working on a new\nversion of the Particl.io website. \n\nWhile we continue to focus on various aspects of the project at the same time,\nwe're still making consistent progress towards getting the new website ready for\nlaunch. \n\nWe expect the revamped website to be ready for deployment relatively soon,\nalthough it is still a bit too early to commit to more precise timelines. So\nstay tuned for further updates on that front!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
