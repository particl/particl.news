Create your Particl wallet to ensure you get access to your PART on launch \n    https://particl.news/guide-how-to-generate-your-particl-exchange-passphrase-1fd78ba36fd1\n 2. Join testers in our Slack with TESTNET#3 featuring RingCT: +Particl\n    Testnet — Getting Started\n    [https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/d9yhExvCaW6vCp3qLUwuW]\n 3.

Join us for our 2nd team AMA hosted by the ARK community. Wednesday June\n    28th, 9am PT in the #trading_altcoins channel on ARK slack.\n\nhttps://ark.io/slack5. Help grow Particl’s user base ahead of launch:\n\n * Leverage Steemit platform/users by creating articles on Particl dev team\n   bringing Confidential Transactions, RingCT, voting and governance to\n   bitcoin’s codebase and how that is good for all. Tag using #particl\n * Reddit/Twitter/Bitcointalk posts that get word out about Particl’s upcoming\n   privacy features, significance of privacy in anticipation of marketplace,\n   significance of choice of privacy (RingCT or CT)\n * Articles on Particl staking, passive income opportunities by running a node,\n   especially when marketplace starts getting used around the world.\n * Get Involved. As the project is getting closer to mainnet the team is looking\n   for more community growth and participation opportunities. This could be\n   helping with our social channels (twitter, reddit, etc), creating a\n   development community for Particl, creating a writing community and gathering\n   graphic, design orientated individuals to help with promotions, marketing and\n   PR.\n\nAs we near the end of our wait I ask you to hold strong and prepare for world\ndomination.\n\nThank you,\n\nParticl Team","html":"<p>We appreciate the patience the Particl community, developers, contributors and testers have shown over the past 2 months.
