Just like the previous vote\non the Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html], which\nended up with a fantastic participation rate, this coming voting period is going\nto be another first in Particl’s history; the first-ever protocol consensus\nchanging vote.\n\nLet’s see what that means and explore this proposal’s timeline.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal in Short\nThe Decentralized Treasury Model\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] is a critical proposal that\nsuggests modifying the blockchain parameters to ensure a self-sustainable and\nsteady source of PART income to the ecosystem. If approved, this would lead to\ncreating a Treasury Fund that would collect, at every staked block, a number of\nPART coins that can then be used by either the Particl team or the community to\nfund initiatives and projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about this proposal, you can refer directly to the proposal here\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] or read the related Particl\nNews blog post here\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/].\n\nThe First-Ever Protocol Consensus Voting Process\nThis proposal suggests modifying the PART emission rate and dividing block\nrewards between stakers and a Treasury Fund. And because the scope of the\nchanges proposed here are quite significant and affect the protocol directly, a\n“protocol consensus changing vote\" is thus required.\n\nA protocol consensus changing vote is not much different than any other type of\non-chain voting on Particl. The differences are with the required approval rate,\nwhich is 75% instead of 60%, and the duration of the voting process, which is\n10,080 blocks (~2 weeks) instead of 5,040 (~1 week).\n\nAside from these two differences, the process of voting on a protocol consensus\nchanging proposal is exactly the same as voting on a non-protocol consensus\nproposal.\n\nThe Timeline\nTo give enough time for stakeholders to prepare their nodes for the vote, we\nwant to reveal today the timeline that will lead us to begin this voting\nprocess. That’ll allow everyone to prepare accordingly and ensure no block is\nwasted (i.e., a block that registers no vote).\n\nThis Tuesday\nThis Tuesday (tomorrow), we will close the proposal’s discussion phase and merge\nit to get it ready for its voting phase. If you still have questions, comments,\nor general feedback about this proposal, please leave a comment on its Github\npage [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] before it gets merged.\n\nOn the same day, we will communicate the block numbers for when the vote will\nstart and end. Expect a pre-notice of roughly 72 hours (approximation based on\naverage block time) before the vote starts.\n\nParticl’s staking application, Partyman, will also be updated and allow\nstakeholders to set up their voting preferences in advance so that their node(s)\nstart casting votes as soon as they can.\n\nThis Friday\nIt is estimated that, on this week’s Friday, the voting period will begin. This\nis only an estimate as the actual time the voting will start is based on a block\nnumber, not a specific date or time. As block times can vary (they are on\naverage 2 minutes apart), we can only offer an estimate.\n\n10,080 Blocks Later\n10,080 blocks after the voting period begins, or approximately two weeks, the\nvoting period will end and we’ll be able to communicate the official results\n(they are publicly available on the blockchain).\n\nTo ensure the team acts as fast as possible on the outcome of the vote, we will\nprepare, in advance, builds containing the required modifications for the\ndecentralized treasury model to be implemented.\n\nIf the proposal is approved by stakeholders, we will send these builds to\nexchanges and request their collaboration to roll out the hardfork (exchanges\nrequire a pre-notice of several days or weeks). If, at some point, there is a\nmathematical certainty that the proposal is approved, the team will submit in\nadvance its request to hardfork to exchanges, even if the voting process is not\nentirely done. That should save the project a few days and allow us to move\nfaster.\n\nIf the proposal is rejected, the team will not use the builds it developed in\nadvance and keep, unchanged, the blockchain parameters as they are currently. In\nthat situation, the Particl blockchain will still hardfork, but that’ll only\ncontain changes related to the re-activation of temporarily disabled anon and\nblind outputs.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, this is a critical proposal for the future of the project and the\necosystem. It has vast implications and may lead to vital changes to the\nunderlying protocol of the blockchain. Regardless of if you want to approve or\nreject this proposal, it is highly recommended that you cast your vote and let\nyour voice be heard. There has never been a more important time to do so.\n\nAs always, we want to thank you for your immense support and hope that you all\nvote in great numbers on this future-shaping proposal.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This marks a significant milestone\nfor the Particl ecosystem as it moves towards a more community-powered form of\ngovernance.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go over this proposal’s\nimplications.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nVoting for the Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] was a\nsignificant event for the Particl project. It was the first time a CCS proposal\nrequired to be approved through a vote and, for this reason, served as a great\nshowcase and test of Particl’s on-chain voting technology.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mindblowing 99.97% approval rate (minimum required is 60%) and a \n63.17% participation rate (minimum required is 20%). Indeed, the vote lasted for\n5,040 blocks, with 3,184 of them voting in favor of the proposal and just one\nblock voting against it.\n\nWhat About the Claim Process Now?\nWith the proposal officially approved by Particl stakeholders, now’s the time to\nget moving! As such, we can now announce that the claim period will begin\ntomorrow. To help you understand the output claim process and its timeline, we\nwill publish, tomorrow, a blog post on Particl News containing all the necessary\ninformation to submit your outputs and get them validated so that they can be\nre-enabled after the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIt’s important to be aware that the output claim process will be separated into\ntwo phases; the pre-fork and post-fork phases. \n\nIf you submit your outputs for validation before the upcoming hardfork and the\ncutoff date, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use\nyour currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course,\nimplies that your claim gets approved.\n\nKeep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance\nbefore the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the\nactual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase\nis actually going to be several days or weeks before the hardfork. We will\nclearly communicate this deadline before its time.\n\nIf you submit your outputs after the upcoming hardfork, then you’ll be part of\nthe post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but\nyou’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current\ntime, not scheduled.\n\nFor this reason, we strongly recommend submitting your outputs as fast as you\ncan.\n\nHeaded Towards Community Governance\nIt is safe to say that this on-chain voting exercise, the first of its kind on\nthe Particl network, was a resounding success. It highlights just how active\nParticl stakeholders are and how willing they are to actively participate in the\ngovernance of the project.\n\nWith this highly encouraging participation rate in mind, you can expect more\nproposals requiring a vote to be published on the CCS in the weeks, months, and\nyears to come. Some of them may come from the Particl team itself, but anyone\ncan submit a proposal of their own and request a vote for it.\n\nOn that end, the Particl team would like to reiterate its position that it fully\nsupports and encourages quality community initiatives. It is by having a good\nmix of team and community proposals, as well as a significant diversity in the\nideas proposed on the CCS, that Particl will achieve optimal levels of\ndecentralization!\n\nSecond Proposal Voting to Begin This Week\nThe Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] is\nonly the first proposal to require on-chain voting of many to come. As such, a\nsecond proposal, the Decentralized Treasury Model proposal\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8], will begin its voting phase\nat the end of this week.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News as we will publish, later today, a blog post\nexplaining in detail the timeline for this proposal and its voting phase. If you\nstill have questions, comments, or general feedback about it, please leave a\ncomment on its Github page [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] \nbefore it gets merged into the voting phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your overwhelming support and participating in such\nnumbers in this critical first on-chain voting process for Particl. We are as\nconfident as ever moving forward with a more community-powered form of\ngovernance and are pretty excited to see all the great things we will achieve\ntogether!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
