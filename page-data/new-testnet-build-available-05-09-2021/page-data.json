This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nGovernance Module\n * Enable the governance module for testing.\n * Fixed an issue where graphs were not displaying in release builds.\n\nMarket Module\n * Publishing fee estimates now correctly include the image fees.\n * Filtering for expired listings in Sell > Listings page now works correctly.\n * A warning is now displayed when there may be insufficient utxos (but\n   sufficient total funds) to publish a listing AND all its images. The ability\n   to still continue with the publish is possible, but requires the seller to\n   explicitly indicate that this is acceptable.\n * Updated the csv product import functionality to attempt to match on country\n   name (English only for now) instead of just the ISO code.\n * The csv product import now allows for specifying the \"shipping to\"\n   destinations countries in a comma separated list.\n * The market summary text of a market shown in the Joined Markets section is\n   now selectable.\n * Includes changes made to particl-marketplace service such as...\n * Fixed an error that prevented a bid from being placed if all the images of\n   the item in question had not been properly received.\n * Fixed an error that caused the buyflow to become stuck due to the buyer\n   cancelling the purchase arrangement but the seller completing the escrow\n   state prior to receiving the cancellation action.\n * The particl-marketplace service now has some time on termination to attempt\n   to gracefully shut itself down, instead of terminating processing immediately\n   (and potentially causing issues with the processing of messages).\n * Remove the lookup for an existing \"market\" named wallet to create the initial\n   profile/identity wallets from when initializing the service for the first\n   time: this potentially causes errors and requires manual user intervention if\n   the named \"market\" wallet is encrypted and locked during the service\n   initialization.\n\nWallet Module\n * Updated the zap functionality (cold staking) to cater to additional user\n   options.\n * Changed wording on the transaction table entries to make more sense when fees\n   are involved: this includes fees paid for smsg fees (eg: publishing listings\n   via smsg) and zap transaction fees.\n * The restore wallet flow now caters to 12 word mnemonic inputs.\n\nGeneral\n * Added additional messages to message of the day.\n * Spelling and other grammar updates.\n * Update and unify usage of the zmq library dependency.\n * Application crashes should now be handled correctly: instead of receiving a\n   nasty JS error prompt, the error is logged and a friendlier window is\n   displayed indicating that the application has crashed. This is a temporary\n   stopgap change that leads into better logging and user visibility into what\n   the application is doing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and assistance in testing this new version of Particl\nV3.

This week has\nbeen a happy one with the release of the new Particl V3 testnet builds. And so,\nmost of the work on the desktop side of things has been about dealing with\nquestions, assisting, and investigating (and fixing) more minor issues that have\nall come from the community.\n\nStatus of the Current Testnet Round\nWe're excited to announce that, as of yet, nothing significant has been reported\nin terms of blockers that may prevent a mainnet release. The only issue that may\nneed some attention is related to some performance-related concerns that have\nbeen reported on the private-by-default Whonix OS. However, we do not foresee\nany delay caused by this problem as it is relatively minor and straightforward\nto fix. \n\nAdditionally, we'd like to take at least one more week of testing before\ninitiating the process of releasing Particl V3 on mainnet. That's to allow more\ntime for edge-case testing and make sure no new bug is found in the coming days.\n\nAs such, assuming no new issue is found in the days to come, we will be ready to\nannounce Particl V3's mainnet release date next week!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nAside from looking into smaller issues and inquiries regarding the current\nParticl V3 testnet round (that you can track here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]), work has begun towards\nplanning out the next updates and additions for Particl Desktop moving forward\n(based on items from the new roadmap). So, if nothing new regarding the current\ntestnet requires attention, we'll start working next week on the changes planned\nfor the v3.1 release, but also possibly future v3.2 and v3.3 releases as well.\n\nOne useful addition to Particl V3 since the launch of the current testnet round\nis the ability to split UTXOs for public transactions as well (not just anon\ntransactions). The issue was reported by community member Kangoala; thanks for\npointing it out! You can read more about it here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1813\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nOn the Particl Core side of things, we are happy to report that testing has\nresumed on BasicSwap with the closed beta group and that a few changes have been\nmade to the protocol. Much more details regarding BasicSwap coming right after\nthe release of Particl V3 on mainnet. \n\nWe're also excited to tease you by announcing that a new lightwallet client to\neasily store and use PART will join the Particl ecosystem very soon. Indeed, we\ncan report that, today, the first successful mainnet transaction using Particl\nElectrum has been made! \n\n * First Particl Electrum transaction on mainnet: \n   https://explorer.particl.io/tx/36949d5e5ea43b590cf4d20ac31662bc4890197fde77c0d185b46985ac5275e5\n\nParticl Electrum will play an important part for some of the things we have\nplanned ahead. Notably, the lightwallet provides \"light services\" that can be\nused to provide other Particl apps with an access to the blockchain without\nsyncing it entirely. It also provides for an easy way to use the Lightning\nNetwork through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl\nis still in progress. \n\nWe will provide more details about Particl Electrum and explain how it fits into\nthe broader Particl ecosystem as we move forward with our post-V3 strategic\nroadmap! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you again for your support and passion for the project's mission. Exciting\ntimes are ahead, and while we encourage you to keep testing the current testnet\nversion of Particl V3, we certainly look forward to announcing the mainnet\nrelease date. \n\nWe'll be publishing more information next week regarding the mainnet launch of\nParticl V3 and will, at the same time, communicate a few things coming right\nafter or around this event. You can also expect the new roadmap to go live very\nshortly after Particl V3's mainnet launch. \n\nStay tuned and have a great weekend!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This was the last remaining item\nbefore a new Particl V3 testnet build can be released, and we're happy to say\nthat it has been successfully completed!\n\nThat means we've initiated the process of building the new testnet version and\nwill be releasing it publicly in the next 72 hours.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nBuild and Release the New Testnet Client\nAll that remains at this point is to build the new testnet version, test it\ninternally, and then release it for one more round of public testing. All the\nissues highlighted in the progress reports dating from the last testnet client\nup until now have been resolved. One more time, we're asking for your help in\ntesting the new client and trying to find any potential issue. \n\nMore specifically, here are our current areas of interest in regards to this\nspecific testnet round.\n\n 1. Test and verify that any previously mentioned issue is effectively resolved.\n 2. Test the disabling of cold staking from the module and determine whether a\n    previous issue is still present or not. In the previous codebase (\"Particl\n    V2\"), it used to cause problems in some rare cases, but we haven't been able\n    to reproduce it yet on our end. It may, or may not, still be present in\n    Particl V3.\n\nWe are targeting the next 72 hours for the release of the new testnet version of\nParticl V3. So stay tuned for when the news drop on Particl News and the other\nusual communication channels.\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nAside from the usual merging, core developer Tecnovert has resumed working on\nParticl's upcoming BasicSwap decentralized exchange protocol.\n\nAn update to the swapping protocol has gone live and is in the process of being\ntested by participants of the closed beta group.\n\nWhile we haven't made a ton of details on BasicSwap available yet, you can\nexpect that to change soon.\n\nWe'll be publishing more information on the application, how it works, how we\nplan to integrate it into the Particl ecosystem, and what's the longer-term\nvision we have planned for it shortly after the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet. Additionally, you'll be able to test it out for yourself once we\ninitiate the open beta phase around the same time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's all test out the new testnet version of Particl V3 and ensure that it is\nfinally ready for mainnet. Once that is done, we'll be ready to blast forward\ninto the project's next phase and release our new and exciting roadmap.\n\nAs always, thank you immensely for your support and patience.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
