This update introduces a lot of improvements to the\nstartup and shut down processes of Particl Desktop and introduces a few minor\nUI/UX tweaks. While this update does not introduce any new feature, it makes\nParticl Desktop more stable and should go a long way in eliminating a lot of\nissues some users get from time to time when launching the application.\n\n)The entire Particl team would also like to take this opportunity to wish\neveryone in the Particl community a merry Christmas and some wonderful holidays! \nWe highly recommend resting during this period, because 2020 is going to be a\nglorious year for the Particl project and one filled with new objectives and\ngoals!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 2.3.2: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.2\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.2]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

The marketplace is currently only available via the\nParticl Desktop on this wallet. This is a temporary requirement that is going to\nbe improved with the upcoming Market Management\n[https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0] feature.\n\nNotes\n * There will be an automatic update to the latest supported particl-core\n   version, if applicable, when the marketplace is launched.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked in order to process buy and sell orders on\n   the open marketplace, if the wallet is encrypted.\n * The marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus is considered to\n   be a Beta release.\n * NB!! The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source\n   code. Please contact Particl for source code information. The actual source\n   code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval of\n   time has passed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New?\nUI/UX Tweaks\n * Status messages are now displayed on the loading screen when starting up the\n   application and switching between wallets. This should provide an indicator\n   that the startup is proceeding, or that an error has occurred if something\n   fails during startup.\n * A closing modal is now displayed during the shutdown process while the\n   application is shutting down.\n\nFixed Issues\n * The application startup now checks for a running daemon before validating\n   local particl-core binaries or even checking for valid versions. Fixes a long\n   standing problem described in #892\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/892]\n * Fixes the regression with particl core cookie files: the application now\n   properly determines when to read the daemon cookie file.\n * Application startup is no longer dependent on timers polling for various\n   states of activity. This should allow for minor startup performance\n   improvements in many cases.\n * Application shutdown now properly waits for the running daemon to close\n   before closing the visual user interface. This removes the need to try\n   estimate the waiting time of the application shut down, before it can be\n   restarted, which is a particularly annoying issue on Windows. Fixes issues\n   related to #1624 [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1624]\n * The running application’s taskbar icon is now removed immediately when the\n   application begins shutting down, preventing a number of errors in attempting\n   to make use of it while the shutdown process continues. See #1598\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1598] as an example.\n * A single state application instance has been introduced: this means that the\n   application no longer breaks in many cases when attempting to start more than\n   one instance at a time. Attempting to start a second instance will simply\n   switch to the current open/running instance.\n * Testnet and mainnet versions of the application are now properly separated.\n   This fixes reports of testnet installations overriding existing mainnet\n   installs on some operating systems, and ensures that future testnet versions\n   can be installed alongside existing mainnet releases.\n * Fixes an issue where a newly created wallet was not changed to after\n   successful creation (the default wallet would be loaded instead).\n * Imports using CSV files now have an explicit indicator to inform the user of\n   any failed imports.\n * Fixes an issue with items in the cart not being displayed in some cases,\n   requiring the user to clear the cart (with nothing visibly in the cart) in\n   order to add items to it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Desktop-2-3-2-Released/1-hW8PZ0Yf2TBzfsGE-UqKbA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"startup-shutdown-improvements-ui-ux-tweaks-\">Startup/Shutdown Improvements &amp; UI/UX Tweaks ?</h3><p>Just in time for the holiday season, Particl Desktop 2.3.2 has been released on mainnet just earlier today.

It is a\nnew major feature that allows you and anyone else to create an unlimited number\nof markets or storefronts on the Particl network and manage an unlimited number\nof identities across any of these markets through user profiles. It essentially\ntransforms Particl from a marketplace to a network of infinite marketplaces and\nseller shops.\n\nMarket Management is the biggest marketplace update ever since it launched on\nmainnet in August 2019 and will be one of the biggest building blocks of the\nentire Particl eCommerce protocol. The changes and meaning it brings to Particl\nwill shape the marketplace into a unique and powerful marketplace protocol and\nopen up endless possibilities.\n\nThe release of Market Management on mainnet will be a huge milestone in\nParticl’s lifecycle, but it will also mark the beginning of a new and exciting\n“development era” focused on making adoption of the platform as easy as\npossible. That much will be reflected in Particl’s upcoming roadmap update,\nwhich more details can be found in the last section of this Development Update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nThis major Particl Desktop update will also introduce a few other improvements\nwhich will be explained in this Development Update. Without further ado, let’s\njump right into it!\n\nMarket Management\nThe team is still busy implementing Market Management. Most of the required work\nhas already been completed on the marketplace codebase side of things, and the\nteam is now putting the final touches on the flagging and blacklisting functions\nfor user markets and storefronts. Just like for listings, this governance\nmechanism is required for the community to be able to protect itself from\nundesirable content and vote it out. And it will behave just like when flagging\na listing too! When a certain market or storefront reaches a certain negative\nvoting threshold, it will get delisted off of the client.\n\nFollowing this, the new code will need to go through various integration tests\nto ensure it is secure and without bugs, after which the first testnet build\nwill be released for community testing.\n\nIdentities and User Profiles\nMarket Management also introduces a brand new concept — Identity Management. In\nfact, each market will be able to be created using any identity and sellers will\nbe able to manage an unlimited number of them spread across an unlimited number\nof markets through the user of user profiles.\n\nThis new marketplace function is already completed in the codebase and is now\nawaiting the completion of the remaining Market Management components before the\nintegration process can be finalized and properly tested.\n\nSMSG Network\nDue to the new changes brought forth by Market Management, the SMSG network will\nalso need a few tweaks to ensure that messages are carried properly between\ndifferent markets, storefronts, as well as the “open market”.\n\nThe required modifications are currently being worked in at this moment.\n\nSearch Function Improvements\nAnother set of improvements coming up has to do with the search function of the\nmarketplace. This is yet again due to the scope of the changes caused by Market\nManagement, as the search function will now need to be able to properly search\nfor items across different markets/storefronts. A few minor improvements to the\nsearch function will also be added to the next Particl Desktop update, which\nwill be followed by more significant improvements and additions (i.e. sort by,\nfilters, etc) in future updates.\n\nThis improvement is still being worked on at the moment and should be completed\nsoon as well.\n\nGUI and UI/UX Changes\nAs can be expected, Market Management is going to introduce a lot of changes to\nParticl Desktop’s user interface and experience. That’s because the Market\nManagement feature fundamentally changes the very nature of Particl’s\nmarketplace from a single marketplace to an entire network of marketplaces and\nseller shops.\n\nWhat that means is that, once Market Management goes live, Particl Desktop might\nlook and feel a bit different than what you’re used to. The team is still busy\npreparing the GUI for the full Market Management and user profile integrations.\n\nVisible and Accessible When First Starting the Application\nOne of the obvious changes that eventually needed to be done on Particl Desktop\nis the ability to easily start buying and selling on the marketplace without\nhaving to go through the hassle of manually creating a second wallet named\nMarket. To that effect, the team is currently integrating that function into\nParticl Desktop and it will be bundled in with the upcoming Market Management\nupdate.\n\nHow the new process will look like will work is as follow:\n\n * Users who already have a Market wallet activated will see their wallet be\n   automatically converted to fit the new marketplace structure. There is no\n   additional step to convert your Market wallet into the new marketplace\n   structure other than updating Particl Desktop.\n * Users who install Particl Desktop for the first time and looking to use the\n   marketplace will be presented with a new setup process that is clear and\n   visible and will allow the user to create both the default wallet and a\n   Market wallet at the same time.\n\nThis new way of accessing the marketplace will make it much easier for everyone\nto get started with Particl’s marketplace.\n\nGeneral Performance Improvements\nWith all of the above being said, let’s not forget that the next Particl Desktop\nupdate will also introduce several performance improvements. That’s because this\nupdate touches a majority of the marketplace codebase and refactors it with more\nefficient and “mature” processes.\n\nThe sum of all the minor improvements applied here and there will be translated\nin Particl Desktop being a little lighter and faster than it currently is. The\nmarketplace should also be even smoother to use.\n\nPerformance improvements to the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client are\ntypical whenever a new version of Particl Desktop is released, but this\nparticular update should see a relatively-more-significant-than-usual\nperformance boost.\n\nETA?\nIt is difficult to give a proper ETA for the delivery of Market Management as\nintegration tests are pretty much unpredictable and can take a shorter or longer\ntime to complete depending on the results. The very good news, though, is that\nmost of the code is now completed on the codebase level and that we are just\nabout to embark into the integration/testing phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpcoming 2020 Roadmap Update\nThe Particl team is also working on its new 2020 Development Roadmap which will\nbe heavily focused on the adoption of the marketplace. As Market Management is\nreleased, it will mark the end of a significant development sprint and the\nbeginning of a new one. The release of the new roadmap will be the cornerstone\nof this new phase of development.\n\nAn ETA until its release cannot be stated just yet, but it really won’t be long\nanymore. The team is currently evaluating many roadmap items and setting up the\npriorities as well as the roadmap structure before publishing it to the public.\nOne thing is certain, it’s that the new roadmap will be pretty exciting as the\nmarketplace becomes more and more mature and easy to use. This is where it gets\nvery interesting as “new user retention” becomes much better!\n\nYou can expect a few articles to be posted on Particl.news within a few days,\nwhich will eventually lead to the 2020 roadmap unveiling! As always, stay tuned\nfor more updates! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--09-01-20-/1-d6f-78STDDExgcque1uOgA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"market-management-and-major-particl-desktop-upgrade-\">Market Management and Major Particl Desktop Upgrade ?</h3><p>As most of you already know by now, the Particl team is working on a pretty major update to Particl Desktop and its marketplace — Market Management.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
