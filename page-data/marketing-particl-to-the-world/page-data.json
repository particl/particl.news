This blog\npost will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and\nstrategy as we progress onward.\n\nTable of Contents\n * Putting Marketing in Context\n * Upcoming Marketing Initiatives\n * BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener\n * Community Empowerment\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPutting Marketing in Context\nFirst thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid\nany confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness,\nPR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to\ngain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging\ntowards making Particl more known, liked, and used.\n\nWhy do Marketing?\nIn the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.\n\n * Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)\n * Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.\n\nFor marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need\nto be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any\nmarketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the\necosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to\nstick around and be clear.\n\nThis strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project\nonly spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a\n“spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an\nextreme cost.\n\nHow to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?\nTo achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches\nto marketing.\n\nProduct-focused marketing: Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what\nproducts the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences.\nThis aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked\nto adoption efforts.\n\nBrand awareness and notoriety building: The other approach is to increase\nParticl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part\nof “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve\nnever really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the\nmore free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. \n\nThese two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns\n(mentioned a bit further down this post).\n\nHow is Marketing Funded at Particl?\nParticl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of\ncrowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates\nout of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic\ntreasury system.\n\nThis means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very\nlarge-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the\n“pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets\nusually leverage.\n\nAdditionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current\nlow liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very\ncareful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant\ndownward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.\n\nMarketing Expectations\nDue to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within\nthe blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan\naround that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.\n\nThat’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and\nstrategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many\ninitiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of\nbeing widespread.\n\nAdditionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product.\nIndeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can\nstill be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically\napt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl\nevolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means\nthat marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the\nproduct might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the\nright audiences to target is key.\n\nUpcoming Marketing Initiatives\nNow that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a\ndeeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in\nprogress.\n\nWhat we've done recently\nRe-initiating direct mail marketing Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications. This aims to\nre-engage people who’ve shown interest in Particl in the past and stay connected\nwith current fans. Direct mail marketing is a basic but powerful marketing tool\nand will be used sporadically (we won’t spam your inbox) for essential and\nbundled communications pieces. \n\nIf you still haven’t subscribed to our newsletter, don’t hesitate to do so; it’s\nthe best way to stay in touch! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Particl Academy The Particl Academy is the\nuser-friendly guide to get started with Particl and become more familiar with\nit. It’s a critical piece of information required for newcomers to be able to\nstart using the platform without any hassle. \n\nThis can be the difference between someone interested but who gives up because\nit’s too difficult to get started and someone who sticks around. To browse the\nParticl Academy, simply head over to https://academy.particl.io/ \n\nProduct marketing New roadmap The new development roadmap is not necessarily a\nmarketing item in the proper sense, but it’s nonetheless a vital part of the\nmarketing strategy. That’s because that is where new people usually look to see\nwhat’s coming up next for a project and what is its long-term viability. \n\nThe new roadmap was carefully crafted to make user adoption easier by improving\nthe platform’s accessibility, usability, and user-friendliness. In addition, it\ncommunicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and\nhelps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul. \n\nProduct marketing What's currently in progress\nNew website Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone\nof any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land\nwhen they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a\nmarketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting\nfor its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its\nbest and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better\nconversion rates! \n\nOn that note, we are excited to announce that the new website will go live this\ncoming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021. So make sure to be around next week\nfor its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to\nshow it to everybody! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit) Digital ads are\nhelpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing\nobjectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n\nSecondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us\nto test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can\nthen use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on\nwhat really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we\nare already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few\nother initiatives. \n\nPreparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will\ngradually ramp up within the next three months. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More stories on Particl News At this time,\nParticl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting\nfor those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into\nadvocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain\nParticl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the\nbigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally,\nSEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website. \n\nThis initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few\nwriters. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own\ndedicated “Stories” section. Make sure to have a read when you see a new story\ncome out and share it with the people you think will be interested in it! \n\nBrand awareness Reboot of the Part-Time Show You might remember the Part-Time\nShow, the podcast by Particl ambassador Dr. Kapil. As part of the Particl\nreboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time,\ndifferently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show\nwill feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert. \n\nIt will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including\ne-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed\nnetworks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a\nParticl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much\nmore dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful\ndiscussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s\nsociety. \n\nClubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.\nWe hope that you join along the weekly episodes and participate in the\ndiscussion with us. You might just meet some fascinating folks! More information\nis to come about this in the next few days as we near the first episode. \n\nBrand awareness New team member To help with the many marketing tasks we have on\nour deck, a new team member will join the communications and marketing team in\nNovember. This new team member, which will mostly fill the role of a\ncommunications assistant, will be critical in allowing the team to deploy\nmultiple initiatives in parallel and amplify our efforts. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Community budget Also to help with marketing\nand encourage community initiatives, the team will be setting up and deploying a\ncommunity marketing budget very soon. At the time of this writing, a group has\nbeen formed on Element with a few community members eager to help spread the\nword and deploy initiatives of their own. A community budget intends on\nsupporting these go-getters with resources from the team. \n\nLookup the Community Empowerment section of this blog post further down below\nfor more information on how to get involved. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Occasional Reddit AMAs With the Particl reboot\ngoing on strong, there are a lot of things changing around the project and a ton\nto look out for. But with so much information, it’s possible that you may have\nsome questions. So from time to time, the Particl team will run AMAs on its\nsub-Reddit and pin it so that anyone can ask their questions and have the answer\ndisplayed prominently for all others to see. This should help with transparency\nand circulating important information to the community. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing What comes after\nWider distribution of press releases Distributing press releases in quality\npublications will lead to more organic coverage as editors and writers scout PR\npublications daily for exciting content. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More podcast appearances and interviews With\nimproving Particl's brand awareness in mind, appearing in more podcasts and\ninterviews will help spread the Particl word further and expose the project to\nmany more people. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Publish more documentation For Particl to gain\nadoption, using the platform and understanding how to use it must be as easy as\npossible. Publishing more educational, informational, and technical\ndocumentation will help with that. \n\nProduct marketing Increase social media activity and exposure Crypto Twitter is\nwhere it's at, and Particl needs to have better exposure within that community\nif it wants to go viral. So improving Particl's social media exposure and taking\npart in the discussion is important and planned for the near future. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Integrate other coins into Particl Desktop \nBecause so much has changed with Particl V3, support for other coins is\ntemporarily disabled. We plan on adding that feature back right after releasing\nthe SMSG Manager (roadmap item). Integrating more coins and making it easier for\ntheir users to acquire PART increases the potential for adoption within these\ncommunities. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing New exchange listings Getting listed on new\nexchanges is a no-brainer to improve liquidity, exposure and make the platform\nmore accessible. The team is currently in negotiation with two exchanges and\nshould have more news on the subject soon. More exchange listings are planned as\nlong as the listing costs are reasonable, and the exchange can provide real\nvalue back to the project. \n\nBrand awareness Seed the marketplace with more listings A few months ago, a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html] that\nsuggested seeding the marketplace with many listings was published (and funded).\nAdding thousands of listings will give the marketplace the boost it needs to get\nthe ball rolling and become a vibrant e-commerce platform. This initiative is\ncurrently under active development. \n\nProduct marketing It obviously doesn't stop here, but the team will work on the\nitems mentioned above in the short to mid-term. If you have any marketing ideas\nor suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.\n\nBasicSwap; A Major Door Opener\nWhen it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl\nMarketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind\ndecentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new\nParticl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open\nbeta: BasicSwap.\n\nAs you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t\nknow each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains.\nBasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the\nsame time, the project’s marketing strategy.\n\nIncidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for\ncryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to\nregister and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look\nfor decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share\nof decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an\nexcellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!\n\nBasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible,\nprivate, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads.\nBasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on\nits own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an\nintegrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl\necosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an\nall-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming\nto fruitition!\n\nIn other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful\napp; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader\nParticl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind\nwhen you talk about Particl to other people.\n\nCommunity Empowerment\nThe best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community.\nThat’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a\nnew dedicated budget!\n\nDo you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead?\nThen simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a\nwritten proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked\nto publish it on the CCS [https://ccs.particl.io]. Once your proposal is live,\nthe team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.\n\nPublishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level\nof transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps\ndetermine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to\nparticipate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!\n\n> Note 1: Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels\nof detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write\nthem down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative\nyourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in\nPART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately\nheaded by whoever makes a proposal.\n> Note 2: If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to\nlead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the\nidea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own dedicated “Stories” section.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

This blog post will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and strategy as we progress onward.</p><h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</h2><p>First thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid any confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness, PR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to gain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging towards making Particl more known, liked, and used.</p><h3 id=\"why-do-marketing\">Why do Marketing?</h3><p>In the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.</p><ul><li>Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)</li><li>Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.</li></ul><p>For marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need to be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any marketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the ecosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to stick around and be clear.</p><p>This strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project only spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a “spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an extreme cost.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-achieve-our-marketing-objectives\">How to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?</h3><p>To achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches to marketing.</p><p><strong>Product-focused marketing: </strong>Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what products the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences. This aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked to adoption efforts.</p><p><strong>Brand awareness and notoriety building: </strong>The other approach is to increase Particl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part of “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve never really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the more free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. </p><p>These two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns (mentioned a bit further down this post).</p><h3 id=\"how-is-marketing-funded-at-particl\">How is Marketing Funded at Particl?</h3><p>Particl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of crowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates out of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic treasury system.</p><p>This means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very large-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the “pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets usually leverage.</p><p>Additionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current low liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very careful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant downward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.</p><h3 id=\"marketing-expectations\">Marketing Expectations</h3><p>Due to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within the blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan around that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.</p><p>That’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and strategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many initiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of being widespread.</p><p>Additionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product. Indeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can still be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically apt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl evolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means that marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the product might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the right audiences to target is key.</p><h2 id=\"upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</h2><p>Now that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in progress.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What we've done recently</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Re-initiating direct mail marketing</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

This\nweek, work has continued on the previously identified items. Additionally,\nfollowing feedback from some of the vendors on the marketplace, there's been a\nfair bit of investigation on listing fees and to determine how they could be\nlowered.\n\nFurthermore, a new update to BasicSwap has been pushed, bringing it closer than\never to its open beta phase (more details on that further down below).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nThis week has been a continuation of last week's list of items. \n\nTo provide a bit of clarity, the team is currently working on the Particl\nDesktop 3.1 (or V3.1) release, which focuses on fixing any bug or issue\nidentified since the launch of Particl V3. It also will include a few feature\nimprovements (i.e., the items mentioned in the list below).\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is a supporting update for the Particl V3 release and is not\nintended to introduce any new major feature or functionality; that is instead\nplanned for Particl Desktop 3.2 and onward. \n\nHere's the short-term to-do list for Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This task is currently in progress and is expected to be\n   completed very shortly.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but\n   has been put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated\n   that this item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nAs we prepare the grounds for the launch of the open beta phase for BasicSwap, a\nnew version for it has been pushed to the closed beta group and requires further\ntesting. This new version introduces a few new features (i.e., private swap\noffers, where users can send private offers that can only be seen by one other\nparticular user) and improves on various functionalities. \n\nAfter the new Particl.io website goes live on Tuesday, you can expect an\nofficial BasicSwap introduction to be the next big piece of communications on\nParticl News. This blog post will explain everything you need to know about\nBasicSwap and officially announce it as the next big item coming up for Particl.\n\nOther than that, an SMSG update has been scheduled for an upcoming Particl\nhardfork. It fixes a case where adjusting markteplace listing fees through \nsmsgfeetarget was ineffective. Investigations on reducing listing fees are\nongoing and additional updates to that effect may be included for the next\nhardfork (no scheduled date at this time, we will inform you when that is the\ncase). \n\nNew Particl Website\nAs mentioned earlier in this update and in yesterday's marketing article, the\nnew Particl.io website is going to go live this coming Tuesday the 26th of\nOctober. Be sure to be around on that day to check it out!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and passion! You are what makes this project! \n\nBe sure to be around next week for the grand reveal of the new Particl website\nand share it far and wide with people you know will resonate with the project's\nmission.\n\nAnd on that note, we wish you all a great weekend.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

proposal to reduce the\nnetwork's coin emission rate and remove the automatic allocation of staking\nrewards to the network treasury, new hardfork-ready Particl Core binaries are\nnow available.\n\nRelease Particl Core 23.2.9 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/23.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md#2329Hashesfe80445b896378e69d5c0950114acca84732378483e39fc89d2fcaadbc84eb97\nparticl-23.2.9.0-x86_64-l...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.2.9.0]These releases\ncontain the following changes:\n\n * Hardfork scheduled for February 1st, 2026, at 12:00:00 UTC.\n * Reduction of stake reward to 3.5% of the money supply.\n * Removal of the forced treasury fund donation stake split (still available and\n   adjustable, but now optional and set to 0% by default).\n * Disabling of frozen blinded spends below 200 PART.\n * New checkpoints.\n\nReduced Inflation Rate and Removal of Automatic Treasury Donations\nOn October 20th, 2025, it was announced that the on-chain vote for the Network\nTreasury and Inflation Adjustments proposal (ID #25) had concluded successfully.\nThe proposal was approved by Particl stakers with a 100% approval rate and a\n63.20% quorum.\n\nThis proposal, which sought to remove automatic staking donations to the network\ntreasury and reduce the network's coin emission to a healthier 3.5% annual rate\n(decreasing by 0.5% per year until stabilizing at 1%), takes effect on February\n1st, 2026, at 12:00:00 UTC.\n\nAs such, it is mandatory to download and run the new hardfork-ready core\nreleases to ensure you are staking on a compatible version when the hardfork\noccurs.\n\nCompatible core versions include:\n\n * Particl Core 27.2.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v27.2.3.0]\n * Particl Core 23.2.9\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.2.9.0]\n *

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
