the time of our weekly\nprogress update. \n\nThis week has been a positive and interesting one with the release of the\nParticl Desktop 3.2 on testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-testnet/] and we'd like to report on\nhow this testing round is going and on what else we've been working on as we\napproach the long-anticipated release of this desktop client update on mainnet.\n\nSo let's jump right into it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nParticl Desktop 3.2 Testnet is LiveThe long-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.2\nupdate is now publicly available on testnet!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-testnet/]As mentioned, earlier this\nweek, we've released Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001] to allow\nfor community-wide testing of the new client before it hits mainnet.\n\nWe can happily report that no significant issue has been found by the community\nyet in any of the new features and functionality introduced by the new update.\nHowever, we are currently investigating an OS-specific display/launch issue\nobserved in Manjaro and potentially some Fedora environments as well. The\ninvestigation is still underway and the issue is intended to be fixed for the\nmainnet launch of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nOther than testnet-related matters, we've started preparing and setting things\nup for the development cycle of Particl Desktop 3.3. This upcoming cycle will\nfocus on improving the back-end code of the desktop application, as opposed to\nadding new features to the wallet or marketplace, and will lay very important\ngroundwork for the next major phase of the Particl ecosystem. We'll communicate\nmore information about this next major phase, which aims at dramatically\nimproving Particl's potential for adoption, shortly in a blog post dedicated to\nthat topic coming soon to Particl News [particl.news].\n\nBut what we can say now, in regards to Particl Desktop 3.3, is that it will\nimprove the desktop's application level of privacy and security as well as give\nusers more control over the way they want to use the desktop client. This will\nbe reflected, for example, by better integrating the Tor network, or by adding\nmore user-defined configuration, among other similar back-end improvements. \n\nStay tuned for more information about what Particl Desktop 3.3 will bring and\nwhat the next major development phase will bring to the Particl ecosystem as a\nwhole (hint: not exclusively desktop-focused ?). \n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort in\nmaintaining Particl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. And this\nweek, this process has taken a particularly good amount of time. You can always\nkeep track of those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. \n\nNote that, in the past, we've referred you to look at Particl's \"Particl Core\"\nrepository to track core updates. But if you've had a look at it this week,\nyou've probably noticed that no code was pushed. That's because new updates are\nonly merged periodically while the bleeding edge stuff stays on a private\nrepository.\n\nIndeed, if you really want to keep track, in real-time, of the progress being\nmade on Particl Core, then the absolute best way to do it is by tracking Particl\ncore developer Tecnovert's private repository here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. There, you can see\nall the code updates being made to Particl Core even before they get officially\nmerged into the official repository. For the Particl addicts, that's the\nrepository to follow!\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAside from the core codebase maintenance, the remaining of this week's efforts\non Tecnovert's end has gone towards researching and exploring various features,\nnew capabilities, and potential new coin integrations for the BasicSwap DEX. \n\nHowever, we don't have much to report in terms of concrete deliverable for the\nweek as most of that time has been spent on research, exploration of\npossibilities, and testing. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving. None of it would be possible without you\nall!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend we'll see you all back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
