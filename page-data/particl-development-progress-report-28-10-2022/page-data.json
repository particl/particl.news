So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe are still working on the three outstanding items we mentioned in last week's\nprogress report. While there have yet to be completed items, we've been making\nsteady progress on our way to the testnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nFor context, here are the three outstanding items:\n\n 1. We still need to complete the integration of the new wallet-specific\n    settings. This ongoing item has been taking a bit longer than anticipated\n    due to more significant and forward-compatible changes to the settings\n    structure — making for a perfect segue into Particl's upcoming major\n    development cycle\n    [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n 2. Once that's done, we must re-add the new marketplace-specific code into\n    Particl Desktop. This is relatively trivial since most of the new code\n    relates to ensuring that the desktop client passes the correct startup\n    parameters to the market service. In other words, there is very little\n    interaction that the marketplace UI does with the rest of the system.\n 3. And then, a couple of tweaks and minor improvements/optimizations need to be\n    done, but they are negligible in terms of effort to sort out.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe're continuing our current final closed beta round of testing, and things have\nbeen going very well. \n\nHere's what we have to report this week:\n\n * We've had a decent number of testers helping us out, including members of\n   other coin projects, which has led to a few bug fixes and general\n   improvements.\n * Notably, we've identified a few issues with swaps done using non-Segwit\n   coins. These have now been promptly resolved!\n * We've also identified a few edge cases where issues could arise under\n   specific conditions. These issues are minor in nature, and none of them could\n   have led to a loss of funds or other similar critical consequences! Those are\n   typically quick fixes, and so we're fixing them as they come.\n * The v0.1.1 version of the BasicSwap GUI is nearly ready and should be live\n   for closed beta testing over the weekend or early next week. This GUI update\n   takes into account many comments, feedback, and user experience improvement\n   suggestions gathered from our testers. Thanks to all testers involved; your\n   help is invaluable!\n * We've dropped the TradingView chart to favour a locally built chart. While it\n   still uses third-party APIs to gather data about coin prices, the graph is\n   now much more stable and useful in the context of BasicSwap's native order\n   book system. Note that the API used is user-configurable and can be turned\n   off, if desired.\n * In the future, we also want to support the historical price chart with a \n   native depth chart based on offers placed on BasicSwap's own order books.\n   This is, however, not planned for the first phase of the public open beta.\n\nAs we continue testing and improving BasicSwap on a daily basis, we are rapidly\ngetting closer to the public launch of the open beta. \n\nWe will keep you up-to-date regarding the testing progress following the testing\nrelease of BasicSwap's v0.1.1 GUI and, on next week's progress report, should\nhave a much better idea of when BasicSwap will be able to jump into the open\nbeta phase!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
