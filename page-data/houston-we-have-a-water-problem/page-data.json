And don’t forget, Amazon’s\n   data consumption isn’t limited to AWS; its cloud outlets, Alexa product and,\n   of course, its Amazon.com [/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/Amazon.com] \n   marketplace, all require massive data warehouses to hold and process the\n   amount of data they collect.\n * And then, one out of five data centers is placed near a water reservoir which\n   is already stressed because of the nearby population. Water cooling is\n   cheaper than air cooling and it uses less energy, sure, but it creates water\n   shortages which tend to often be kept out of the public environmental debate.\n * Arizona for example, which is one of the hottest and driest states in the\n   U.S., is trying to become a new Silicon Valley.

To make things worse, the Colorado River has lost 18% of its flow!

Oh, the hypocrisy!\n\nThat’s a lot to take in, right? By now you probably get the point, but the\nreality is that we’ll need more and more data centers as the worldkeeps on\nincreasing its online presence. As it happens, we will need more data centers to\nsupport the various web services that you use (they all collect as much as they\ncan about you, your activities, preferences, location, habits, etc). What’s\nmore, the promised advent and monetization of AI will drive companies to\nincrease the number of data they collect from all of us, making data the new oil\nor digital gold.\n\nIt's time for a change!\nNo point in calling Houston, this problem won’t go away until we change our\nhabits ourselves. Let’s not be hypocrites here; yes, tech giants act in a very\ndeceiving way and try to sweep the problem under the rug for their own benefit\nand image, but we, the end-user, are ultimately the ones that feed them with the\ndata. As long as we keep using data-hungry services, we are directly causing\nthese environmental issues. The more we use their platforms, the more their data\ncenters will need to grow and the more water will be consumed.\n\nAnd as our online presence is much more likely increase rather than decrease\nover the coming years, there’s a critical question that bears asking.\n\nWhat can I actually do to fix this problem?\nLet's focus on what's under our control. We can’t change the way big tech and\nother internet companies behave; they are and always have been big for-profit\ncorporations with questionable levels of ethics. What we can do is change our\nonline habits and stop feeding “the beast”.\n\n> “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” — Mahatma Gandhi\n“But how can I do this?”, you may ask. The answer may not be as hopeless as\nmight think. \n\nThe internet is currently experiencing what is perhaps its biggest revolution\nsince it began—the rise of \"Web 3\".\n\nWeb 3 is a general term used to reference a new type of applications and web\nservices that work without any third-party or middleman. They are often powered\nby blockchains or other peer-to-peer networks and manage data in a distributed\nway—data is hosted on the computers, or nodes, of the users rather than on\ncentral databases that literally suck the waters out of precious reserves.\n\nTake Particl Marketplace\n[/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/particl.io/marketplace], for example. It’s a\ndistributed online marketplace similar to eBay, but on which no data is\ngenerated. It provides all the essential tools you would need to buy and sell\nstuff online, but unlike eBay, Amazon, or Alibaba, it doesn’t require massive\ndata centers that evaporate our precious water reserves. In fact, it generates\nzero data and has a neutral water consumption level.\n\nOr take Skiff [https://skiff.org/] as another great example. It’s an end-to-end\nencrypted collaborative workspace that gives you similar abilities that you’d\nget using Google Docs, but it does so in a much more ethical way. First, it’s\nprivate and encrypted by default, meaning the company behind cannot collect any\nmeaningful data about you (meaning they then need to store much less of it). And\nsecondly, they are in the process of making their application completely\ndistributed, meaning they could then drastically reduce their \"water consumption\nfootprint\". What a breath of fresh air when you compare this philosophy to what\nbig tech does.\n\nBut you don't even have to step into the new world of Web 3 yet to make a\ndifference. Just change your DNS to one that doesn’t track your every move and\nstores that information in data centers! And by picking the right DNS, you might\neven block all those invasive and annoying ads that you see when you browse the\nweb, use your smart phone or smart tv, and etc. Sounds interesting? Then check\nout this list of recommended DNS servers\n[https://dt.gl/privacy-cookbook-ch-2-4-2021-best-of-dns/]. One small effort that\nimproves your online experience and helps to save our waters, what's not to\nlike?!\n\nChange is now! [https://dt.gl/privacy-cookbook-ch-2-4-2021-best-of-dns/]\nPeople talk a lot about energy consumption, renewable energies, and climate\nchange. But for some reason, water consumption rarely seems to receive the\nscrutiny it should. And you’ve got to wonder why; it is the most scarce treasure\nwe have and it’s rapidly becoming a nightmare to manage. But perhaps the\ncompanies who use the most of it are those with the deepest pockets\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632] and the\nmost...influence?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTogether, we can make a vast difference. All we need is to be aware of the\nproblem and the simple, low-efforts solutions we can all take to protect our\nblue gold. By opting to use Web 3 applications and services rather than\nplatforms powered by massive data centers, we can considerably reduce our levels\nof water consumption and make a real impact; the only reason tech giants need to\nbuild more and more data centers is because we keep on using their applications!\n\n> “Sometimes you’re the only one that can save yourself; for no one is coming to\nsave you.” — R.J.

This week, we've got some interesting news for you as well as a little\nappetizer for what's coming next week.\n\nThe week began with the release of Particl Desktop 3.1, the first update to\nParticl V3. this release introduces adjustable escrow ratios (sellers can decide\nhow much they require buyers to put into escrow) and better inventory management\nfor sellers. It also includes a wide variety of bug fixes, general improvements,\nand quality-of-life tweaks that makes the user experience much better and\nhassle-free. You can see the release blog post by following this link\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/].\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 Live on MainnetThe long-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.1\nupdate is now available on mainnet!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/]Following its\nrelease, some work has gone towards fixing two minor issues encountered by\nusers; the fixes will be part of the next update. But perhaps more exciting is\nthe fact that the team has begun working on the first version of an in-market\ncommunication tool that lets buyers and sellers communicate together. \n\nTo quote Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer on the topic: \"The idea here\nis to provide a mechanism to allow for buyers (and potential buyers) and sellers\nto communicate with each other and have the application alert them using\nnotifications. Something like group/individual chat/messaging applications, but\nwhere the subject is the listing or order in question. \n\nParticl Desktop should then also alert the user to the presence of messages or\nresponses. This is mostly a stop-gap to a future, more complete implementation,\nbut for now it should at least provide a means to interact with the other party\ndirectly, particularly when additional information is required for an order or\nprior to purchasing an item.\".\n\nThis in-market communication feature is one of the first items we'll be working\non delivering in the short-term. In fact, you can expect much more information\nabout the team's plans for the next 6 months as we will publish, next week, our\nsecond funding request on the CCS platform. The proposal will be accompanied, of\ncourse, by an in-depth blog post with all the information you need to know. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nAs mentioned above, this week has been about releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 and\nfixing two minor issues identified by users after its release. The rest of the\nweek has been spent on developing the in-market communication feature, but also\nanother goodie which we'll be revealing next week (got to keep some mystery in\nthe air, after all).\n\nStarting next week, we expect to resume this section's deliverable checklist\napproach as has been the case for the most part of 2021. \n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nAs has been typical for the past few weeks, Particl's core developer, Tecnovert,\nhas spent the week working on Particl Core and BasicSwap.\n\nWhile there is nothing too exciting to report in regards to Particl Core, the\nsame can't be said of BasicSwap. This week has been quite busy with a lot of\ntesting from our closed beta group which has led to many non-insignificant\nimprovements and fixes being made to Particl's upcoming cross-chain and private\nDEX.\n\nLocalParticl.com\nAlthough not an update coming from the team, we want to give a shout-out to the\nLocalParticl.com team who's made yet another useful update to their Particl\nMarketplace web browser [https://ParticlMarketplace.shop] \n(ParticlMarketplace.shop) this week: the ability to subscribe to a listing (or a\nseller) and receive an email notification when a new question or comment is\nposted on its page.\n\nAs a matter of general interest, the LocalParticl.com team also provides three\ndifferent TorV3 nodes which can be used to securely route your connection\nthrough the Tor network.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you all for your support and valuable contributions, they are our infinite\nsource of motivation and are a big part of what keeps us going every day.\n\nStay tuned for next week as we'll publish our second team funding proposal and\nreveal our plans for the next 6 months, you're bound to like what you'll see ?\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend and we'll see you back on Monday! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information about what items\nare planned to be included in the next update in a follow-up blog post that will\nbe published to Particl News very shortly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These are generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.</li></ul><blockquote>Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so backing up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile are backed up as well.</blockquote><ul><li>Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.</li><li>Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the sender's machine.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search criteria under certain cases.</li><li>When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop receiving smsg for that market.</li><li>Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees slightly.</li><li>A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the sending of smsg.</li><li>The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it contains.</li><li>Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market service was starting up.</li><li>Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater visibility when a value is missing.</li><li>The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.</li><li>The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.</li><li>In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed) is shown alongside the refresh button.</li><li>Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).</li></ul><blockquote>Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes afterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to occur.</blockquote><ul><li>Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of items in the batch publish modal.</li><li>Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:</li></ul><blockquote>This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor) as well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for further details).<br><br>These values can be viewed in the listings detail window.<br><br>Do note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's details as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when non-standard escrow ratios are used.<br><br>Orders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any additional information that may be needed.</blockquote><ul><li>A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.</li><li>Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.</li></ul><h3 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h3><ul><li>Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.</li><li>Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored and for the user to regain access to their coins.</li><li>Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.</li><li>A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default value used.</li><li>Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.</li><li>Fixes an issue in using a very high <code class=\"language-text\">inputs_per_sig</code> value on anon related transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.</li><li>Updates the <code class=\"language-text\">locked</code> balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc command <code class=\"language-text\">getlockedbalances</code> for this purpose. The previous means attempted to calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong values.</li><li>Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview page).</li><li>Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative measure.</li><li>Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value. The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.</li><li>The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.</li></ul><blockquote>The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the initial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.</blockquote><ul><li>The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per transaction.</li></ul><hr><p>Particl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
