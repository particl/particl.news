This includes, but isn’t limited to, the initial\nplanning of an SMSG Manager to provide the basis for a unified SMSG processing\nsection for various app/modules (and prepare for the upcoming migration to SMSG\n2.0 later on), a further separation of Particl Desktop and Particl Core, and\nvarious other items.\n\nTo be noted, you can expect the next couple of weeks to be more heavily\nresearch-focused than usual. That’s because the upcoming mainnet release crosses\na lot of items from the current roadmap. As Particl jumps into the next phase of\nits development cycle, a lot of the new, more sizeable roadmap items require\nproper research into their feasibility, security, privacy, decentralization, and\nother various implications.\n\nWith all of the above said, let's get down to the progress report.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nResearch and Experimentation Related to Potential Post-V3 Roadmap Items\nVarious research and experimentation related to post-V3 roadmap items have\nbegun. This is expected to last for a few weeks as the team is finalizing its\npost-V3 roadmap, establishing priorities, and so on. We will publicly release\nthe roadmap and the team's vision, goals, and objectives for the foreseeable\nfuture very soon.\n\nStay tune as we’ll push everything, as per usual, through Particl News and our\ntypical communications channels.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nMainnet Release of Particl V3\nParticl V3 is currently going through what is expected to be its final testnet\nround. A few minor issues have been picked up so far by the community, but it\nstill doesn’t appear, at this time, like a new testnet round will be required.\nThank you all for your precious help!\n\nStill, we want to reiterate our call for help to all Windows 10 users who\ncouldn’t run previous Particl V3 testnet builds. While the issue appears to have\nbeen fixed, we’d like to gather as much feedback as possible from you to ensure\nthat the build works fine over as many different environments as possible.\n\nAs we are lining everything up for Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, we will\nvery soon announce its exact release date. Keep an eye on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and other communications channel; the date will be\nclearly announced in advance so that everybody has the time to prepare and\nspread the word.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan you feel it? After months of hard work, Particl V3 is finally ready to be\nunleashed to the world. And it can’t come at a better time; the world\nincreasingly realizes that it needs it, and that feeling will only get stronger\nas time passes by.\n\nAs a final word for this update, we’d like to mention that if you plan on\nselling stuff on Particl Marketplace, then we encourage you to download the CSV\nInventory File template using the current testnet build by navigating to the\nSELL / Inventory & Products / Import / CSV File section of Particl Desktop.\nThat’ll allow you to prepare your listings before the mainnet release so that\nyou can get down to business in lightning-fast fashion.\n\nThanks for the tremendous support throughout the entire development cycle of\nParticl V3. It can be hard, at times, to quantify the impact of supporting\nwords, but it’s been of great help to all team members and makes all the blood,\nsweat, and tears that was put into it worth more than anything in the world.\nLet’s change the world for the better, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
