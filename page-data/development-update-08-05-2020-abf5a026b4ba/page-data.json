The Particl team, along with a few outstanding\ncommunity contributors, have been working tirelessly in preparation for the\nrelease of Particl’s biggest update to date: Particl Desktop 2.4.0 (Infinite\nMarkets). How does all that work translate into real-life?\n\n * A significantly bigger release than initially expected — more user-friendly,\n   more features, and a more efficient back-end\n * Groundworks laid for outreach at scale\n * Ease the community into marketing Particl at scale\n * Support sellers and help them recognize Particl as an additional sales\n   channel that can benefit their business\n\nNot only has development been progressing very well, but the last few weeks have\nalso been very instrumental in laying solid foundations that will make Particl’s\nadoption as easy as it’s ever been.\n\nIn this update, we’ll break down everything that’s been happening. It is also\nthe perfect opportunity to reveal a few surprises that have been in the works\nfor some time now. So get ready, because this Project Update is going to be a\ncool one!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents (Click Me!)\n * Development Update\n * More Frequent Updates\n * Particl Academy\n * New Official Website and Messaging Strategy\n * Vendor Onboarding Program\n * New Coins and Exchanges Coming Up on Particl\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nTo refresh your mind, here are the most noteworthy items that are going to be\nintroduced in Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\n * Listing fees reduced by 80% or more\n * Infinite Markets & Market Management\n * Identity Management and seller profiles\n * Significant performance boost\n * More lightweight Particl Desktop client\n * The marketplace now enabled by default on first startup\n * Various user-interface and user-experience improvements\n * (NEW) A surprise feature currently being integrated (roadmap item)\n\nIn the last Development Update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f], it was\nmentioned the new market codebase was mostly ready and going through various\nrounds of testing designed to find any issue within the code. Well, a LOT has\nhappened since then and there’s a lot to say about it, so without further ado,\nlet’s dive right into it.\n\nMarketplace\nNew Marketplace Overview Page (WIP)As you already know, the market codebase has\nbeen going through a major refactoring process since the last Particl Desktop\nupdate. And while the integration tests have been generally positive, they have\nhighlighted a few key opportunities to add more components and improve on the\nnew ones before going live.\n\nThe team has immediately started working on these items which are resulting in\nmore changes being made to the codebase. The end result will be a much more \nefficient and future-proof foundation that will make features better and\neasier/faster to integrate.\n\nIt will also translate in a much bigger update than initially anticipated.\n\nThese new changes are necessary for Particl to move forward and quickly tackle\nits roadmap. Case in point, it’s already enabling a few surprise features that\nwere initially planned for much later during Beta.\n\nIt’s unclear yet exactly how many of these surprise features will be ready in\ntime for Particl Desktop 2.4.0, but stay alert because you might be impressed at\nhow fast they’ll end up going live.\n\nFor now, what they are will remain a mystery, but watch out as they might be\nrevealed very soon in one of the now regular development updates (keep reading\nfor more info on this).\n\nParticl Desktop\nMarket Browser — Empty (WIP)As mentioned in the previous Development Update,\nParticl Desktop is also being completely re-written from scratch. That means all\nof its back-end code is now different and, quite frankly, much more modern than\nany previous Particl Desktop version. That means it will now look slightly\ndifferent, be more responsive, faster, lighter, and just overall better!\n\nThe progress made on the development of the new Particl Desktop client is\nactually quite far ahead. The codebase has been complete for a while now and the\n“wiring” of the front-end client to the back-end (the market codebase) is\nprogressing smoothly.\n\nTweaks and minor improvements to the user interface are still being made at this\ntime and will be ongoing up until the mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\nIn-App Swap Engine\nChanges have also been made to the in-app “exchange module” to easily allow new\ncoins and exchanges to be added or removed on the fly without requiring any\nParticl Desktop update. The update is currently being tested and the team is\nputting the final fixes to the engine.\n\nThese changes are mandatory for what comes next for Particl. Keep reading this\nProject Update to learn more about when new coins and exchanges will be added to\nParticl.\n\n> Note: For simplicity, Particl’s in-app “exchange module” is now going to be\nreferred to as the swap engine, or in-app swap engine.\nETA for Testnet Release\nWallet Overview Page (WIP)Since the last development update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f], a significant\namount of additional work has been accomplished by Particl’s developers and\nthere’s more left to be completed. That only means Particl Desktop 2.4.0 will be\na much bigger update than initially anticipated. It will be faster, lighter, and \npack many, many more features and functionalities.\n\nFor all these reasons, it’s difficult to estimate exactly how long it will still\ntake for the testnet build to be ready. As it stands today, internal builds of\nthe new Particl Desktop client, with the marketplace, are working well for the\nmost part. However, it may still take a few weeks before the testnet build is\nready for community-wide testing. This, of course, ultimately depends on how the\nvarious code testing rounds go.\n\nBut don’t worry, it only means good things. While it may take longer than\nexpected to see the release of this update, the many changes currently being\nmade to Particl will allow some of the roadmap items that were planned for later\nduring Beta to be integrated much faster. That means it will significantly\nreduce the time between the release of future feature updates and make the\noverall user experience of the marketplace better, something that definitely\nhelps with user adoption.\n\nSo hang tight! Every day brings us closer to the testnet release. This will be a\nmoment that will profoundly change the game for Particl, and one that might have\njust as much impact, if not more, as the first-ever mainnet release of the\nmarketplace.\n\nMore Frequent Updates\nIn recent months, the Particl team has made the decision to start developing\nParticl in private repositories to protect its work from copy-cats and scam\nprojects. What this means is that, while all of Particl’s released code is\npublicly available (minus the Particl Desktop client), the unreleased code is\nnow kept private.\n\nUnfortunately, it also means that it’s now almost impossible to track the\ndevelopment progress by yourself. Whereas Particl’s Github used to be buzzing\nwith activity, it is now pretty quiet…publicly quiet at least (remember, it’s\nthe calm before the storm!).\n\nFor this reason, and to strive for as much transparency as possible, Particl is\nnow going to start making more regular development updates. That’ll allow you to\ntrack the development progress more pro-actively and understand more precisely\nthe status of the project at any given time.\n\nThe new development updates will be published both here on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news] and on the #Progress-updates channel of Particl’s Discord\n[https://discord.me/particl] server.\n\nParticl Academy\nLaunching during the Particl Desktop 2.4.0 testnet phase and prior to the\nmainnet release, the Particl Academy is a new documentation hub containing all\nthe information you’ll ever need on Particl from both a vendor’s and a user’s\nperspective.\n\nIt includes step-by-step user guides for everything, in-depth guides about some\nParticl’s core components, FAQs, troubleshooting, documentation, and all the \nbasic instructions to get anyone started with Particl in no time.\n\nMaybe more importantly, the Particl Academy is written in human language. Forget\nall the crypto technical mumbo jumbo, all that stuff is moving to Particl’s Wiki\npage. The Particl Academy is an easy to follow interactive user manual meant to\nexplain what is Particl and how to use it in a way that anyone can understand,\nregardless of their “technical level”.\n\n> Pro-tip: When it goes live, it would be well advised to always link to the\nParticl Academy whenever trying to get someone new to try or look into Particl.\nThat’ll allow them to quickly put the pieces together and get started in just a\nfew minutes!\nNew Official Website and Messaging Strategy\nParticl is refining its message using a three-pronged approach, and with that\ncomes a few changes to where new users usually get their first point-of-contact.\n\nThe Official Website\nIn the first place, Particl’s website is getting a significant overhaul both in\nterms of content, look, and purpose. More than just a simple refresh, the new\nwebsite will look and feel completely different and will now focus on the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, the website is usually what people usually first come across when\nsearching for Particl. For this reason, it needs to quickly explain what Particl\nis and how it can make that person’s life better. This needs to be made as clear\nand straightforward as possible. The official website is all about what’s\nParticl and how it’ll make your life better.\n\nParticl Wiki\nIn the second place, all the technical and crypto-focused information will be\nmoved to the Particl Wiki to make room for a simpler and more effective message\non the website. That means Particl’s Wiki page now becomes the main place to get\nall the deeper technical information that crypto fans might usually be\ninterested in. The Particl Wiki is all about how Particl works and its\nunderlying technologies (blockchain, P2P, etc).\n\nParticl Academy\nAnd finally, the Particl Academy comes in as the third and final piece to the\npuzzle. It’s the informative hub, the interactive user manual. It contains all\nthe basic information and instructions required to use Particl to its full\nextent. It’s also written in a way that anyone can understand and is meant to\nmake onboarding new users a much easier task. The Particl Academy is all about\nhow to use Particl in a way anyone can understand.\n\nWith that strategy, it now becomes easy to redirect new people to the right\nplace depending on a few factors such as their technical level or what they want\nto do/know about Particl.\n\nThe bottom line is…this methodical separation of the messaging into three main\nplatforms will allow anyone in the community to spread the Particl word as\nefficiently as ever and see better results with fewer efforts!\n\nVendor Onboarding Program\nThe Vendor Onboarding Program (VOP) is a program designed to help make the\nprocess of onboarding new sellers easier and help them make their first steps in\nthe world of decentralized eCommerce. It also provides all the tools required\nfor anyone to actively participate in reaching out and getting new sellers to\njoin Particl.\n\nThe “VOP” has two main objectives.\n\n * To help and support new sellers getting started on Particl\n * To make it easier and more efficient for anyone to reach out to online\n   sellers\n\nTo help and support new sellers, the VOP will provide added benefits and perks\nto sellers who opt to register to the program. These include the funding of\nlisting fees, the promotion of markets and storefronts, access to VIP channels,\npersonalized support, more exposure within Particl’s community, and many more\nbenefits that will be revealed at a later time.\n\nAll of these benefits are pre-packaged into an easy-to-join program that can be\nlinked by anyone in the community. Combined with the Particl Academy, it\ncompletely takes away the burden of walking a new seller through the whole\nprocess of explaining what’s Particl, how it can benefit them, how to use it,\nwhere to seek for help, and etc. All that’s left for you to do is to find online\nsellers you think would be a good fit on Particl and point them in the right\ndirection (the Particl Academy and the VOP).\n\nUltimately, a better and more structured onboarding process only leads to more\nsellers joining the platform, which inevitably means more products and diversity\nof choice on the marketplace.\n\nMore details about the VOP and how it will all work will be shared shortly with\nthe community in a blog post of its own.\n\nNew Coins and Exchanges Accepted on Particl ?\nThe mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0 is an important milestone for the\nproject. It is the completion of a multi-year long vision that initially aimed\nat providing a decentralized, trustless, and private eCommerce protocol that\nallows anyone to create its own market. And with the new shiny Particl Desktop\ngoing live on mainnet, now will be the time to finally show off Particl to the\nrest of the world!\n\nAs such, after Particl Desktop 2.4.0’s mainnet release, Particl will start\nadding new coins and exchanges to its swap engine, opening the marketplace to an\nunlimited number of cryptocurrency users and communities. In fact, it will now\nbe possible to add or remove coins and exchange on the fly without requiring any\nParticl Desktop update.\n\nAre there specific coins that you would like to use on Particl? Or maybe you\nthink a specific cryptocurrency community might benefit greatly from\ndecentralized eCommerce? Now’s the time to start thinking and talking about it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, we would like to thank the entire Particl community for all the recent\nefforts put into the many community-led initiatives and in spreading the word\nabout Particl. Let’s just say this, getting more people to try Particl is about\nto get a whole lot easier for everyone with everything that’s coming up,\nincluding Particl Desktop 2.4.0, the Particl Academy, the VOP, the new website,\nand etc. All of your efforts are about to reap more results! ?","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-lUw_dvIR7xVR-IcTt2IZSw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"dev-updates-new-website-particl-academy-new-coins-and-more-\">Dev Updates, New Website, Particl Academy, New Coins, and More! ?</h3><p>In the past few weeks, Particl has been going through what can only be described as the “calm before the storm”.

It’s the informative hub, the interactive user manual. It contains all the basic information and instructions required to use Particl to its full extent. It’s also written in a way that anyone can understand and is meant to make onboarding new users a much easier task. <strong>The Particl Academy is all about how to use Particl in a way anyone can understand.</strong></p><p>With that strategy, it now becomes easy to redirect new people to the right place depending on a few factors such as their technical level or what they want to do/know about Particl.</p><p>The bottom line is…this methodical separation of the messaging into three main platforms will <strong>allow anyone in the community to spread the Particl word as efficiently as ever and see better results with fewer efforts!</strong></p><h2 id=\"vendor-onboarding-program\">Vendor Onboarding Program</h2><p>The Vendor Onboarding Program (<strong>VOP</strong>) is a program designed to help make the process of onboarding new sellers easier and help them make their first steps in the world of decentralized eCommerce.

It is the completion of a multi-year long vision that initially aimed at providing a decentralized, trustless, and private eCommerce protocol that allows anyone to create its own market. And with the new shiny Particl Desktop going live on mainnet, <strong>now will be the time to finally show off Particl to the rest of the world</strong>!</p><p>As such, after Particl Desktop 2.4.0’s mainnet release, <strong>Particl will start adding new coins and exchanges to its swap engine</strong>, opening the marketplace to an unlimited number of cryptocurrency users and communities. In fact, it will now be possible to add or remove coins and exchange on the fly without requiring any Particl Desktop update.</p><p>Are there specific coins that you would like to use on Particl? Or maybe you think a specific cryptocurrency community might benefit greatly from decentralized eCommerce? Now’s the time to start thinking and talking about it!</p><hr><p>Finally, <strong>we would like to thank the entire Particl community</strong> for all the recent efforts put into the many community-led initiatives and in spreading the word about Particl. Let’s just say this, getting more people to try Particl is about to get a whole lot easier for everyone with everything that’s coming up, including Particl Desktop 2.4.0, the Particl Academy, the VOP, the new website, and etc. All of your efforts are about to reap more results! ?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-kIitAEowaU0o1zRORB8yAQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-lUw_dvIR7xVR-IcTt2IZSw.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"dev-updates-new-website-particl-academy-new-coins-and-more-"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Dev Updates, New Website, Particl Academy, New Coins, and More! ?"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In the past few weeks, Particl has been going through what can only be described as the “calm before the storm”.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
