Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\n(4:07 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=4m8s]) Is it still the plan to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop.\nYes. We still have big plans for Changelly, and we definitely think they will\nhelp a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide\narray of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also\nprovide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a\nlot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.\n\nAs per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our\nmain wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate Changelly, but also\nany other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several\nother services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services.\nWe believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much\nmore adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing\nthem more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.\n\n(4:07 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&feature=youtu.be&t=4m8s]) Is\nit currently being worked on?\nThe team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl\nMarketplace and the integration is not being actively worked on right now as it\nhasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to\ndiscuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace,\nbut they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that\nmakes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.\n\nDon’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would\nmake this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities,\nthis will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being\ncurrency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.\n\nWe would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently\nbeing worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by\nchecking out our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report/] page on \nparticl.io [http://particl.io].\n\n(10:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s]) Can the team make atomic swaps\nmore user-friendly?\nAs it currently stands today, atomic swaps (the trustless coin exchanging\nprotocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge\nway to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no\neasy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to\ntrade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.\n\nAt Particl more precisely, we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since\nOctober 2017, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so\nfar. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible\nsolutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of \natomic swaps will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone\nwithout advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first\niteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting\nimproved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how\nadvanced and complicated executing atomic swaps currently is though, such an\neasy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on\nmainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two\nsolutions:\n\nDecentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl\n\nIt’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a \ndecentralized exchange based on atomic swaps somewhere in the future. This is\nobviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to\never happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting\nfor the platform.\n\nCheckout Option\n\nHaving the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like\nto use as part of the checkout process might be a more intuitive way to go about\nit. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This\nwould not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a\nreally user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already\ndo online payments.\n\nDecentralized Exchange Integrations\n\nThere are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the\nmeantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on\nChangelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other\ndecentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless\nsolutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books\nand order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized\nthan their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also\npresent themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more\nliquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated\ninto Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of\nsuch middle-ground services could be found in Altcoin.io [http://altcoin.io/] \nand AtomicWallet [https://atomicwallet.io/].\n\n(16:58 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s]) Has the NJIT Department of\nTechnology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number\nof Transactions?\nFor some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy\nprotocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule\nof thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more\nprivate these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue\nfor some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to\ndeal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and RingCT are on parallel\ntracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of\nmarketplace transactions (since they will all default to RingCT) coupled with\nnon-marketplace RingCT cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a\nsolid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other Particl Dapps then start\nto make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of RingCT-based privacy\ncoins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions\n(currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl,\nreal-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy\non the platform.\n\nThat being said, our RingCT implementation has been academically reviewed by the\nNJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the\nprotocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and\nways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced\nwith many potential scenarios.\n\nWe’d also like to reemphasize that privacy, security, and decentralization are\nthree of our core values. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as\nprivate and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and\nwe are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these\nthree core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core\nfeatures.\n\n(22:54 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s]) Is the team looking into other\nprivacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?\nWe are not looking into other privacy schemes, but Tecnovert is currently\nworking on some RingCT improvements he’s been wanting to implement for some time\nnow. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both WSA’s \nsecurity audit and NJIT’s academic review, some minor issues might have\nconvinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we\nproceed with our RingCT + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not\nconstitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements\nour developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside\nreview. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl\nResearch & Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the RingCT scheme\ncould mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a\nring signature + confidential transaction setup (RingCT) but something a bit\ndifferent. These changes will make the RingCT protocol a more private solution\nand one that is potentially cheaper to use.\n\nThe very first commits related to these RingCT improvements have started\nappearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later\ntime. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by\nTecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.\n\nParticl-Core — Commits [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\n\n(26:10 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=26m10s]) Will the team postpone the\nmainnet release of the marketplace in order to make sure Particl’s RingCT\nprivacy is optimal?\nAs mentioned above, privacy is one of our core value and we would not release\nthe marketplace on mainnet until we are fully satisfied with the level of\nprivacy it offers. That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions\nand improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we\nalso believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction\npool.\n\nIt’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency\ntransactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind\nand in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a \nmajor code refactoring of the MAD escrow system which will make it more private \nand again, potentially cheaper to use. Another example of how privacy and\nsecurity are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat\nprice pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from\nCoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also\nleak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive\nobserver could use to start profiling users.\n\nEvery single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at\nits very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the\nprivacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it\ncomes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and\nit is what we are all about!\n\n(28:33 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s]) When is marketing going to\nkick up?\nInternally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace has\nalready started. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to Jira, just like\nour developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile\nmethodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in\nattaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency,\nand we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm\nteam. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our\nbudget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for\nthe launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure\nthat Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.\n\n(35:11 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s]) Did Qiang Tang work on private\nlistings for Particl Marketplace?\nNo, this is not part of what they reviewed.\n\n(35:45 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s]) How much time would it take the\nteam to release private listings on testnet?\nOur team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the\nyear, so working back from that point private listings should be released on\ntestnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of\na feature as RingCT and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part\nof the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta.\nThe marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and\nthe word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to\nimplement.\n\nAs with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the\norder and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on\na multitude of factors.\n\n(37:01 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s]) If the governance mechanism and\nRingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even\nthough all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?\nAs mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the governance\nsystem and RingCT. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet\nrelease, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if\nthey are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.\n\n(38:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s]) Could we at least have one guest\nper AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?\nYes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the\nmarketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of\nour best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be\npossible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our Lead Graphic\nDesigner CRZ.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Released\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Release\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused\non the marketplace, but its wallet…\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\n\nWe released on the 12th of September Particl Desktop 1.2.3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3], a major update\non the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop. A majority of its user\ninterface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly, and a lot\nof bug fixes and stability improvements were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!

There are some interesting updates, such as the RingCT\nimplementation (enhancements) and the modification currently being done to the\ngovernance system. In fact, the development team is switching the measurement of\nthe voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a\ntime base. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the\nSettings tab have been moved over to the Review section.\n\nYou may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are\nmentions of code refactoring. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms\nof technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the\npast. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our\ndevelopers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure.\nThis means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the\nParticl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient\nways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a code refactoring.\n\n> The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the\nfactoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves\nnonfunctional attributes of the software. —Wikipedia\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]\nYou can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the\nParticl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as smooth, efficient, \npleasant to use, but most importantly, secure and private as possible.\n\nCold Staking Sneak Peek\n> \nWe published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s cold staking pool. While it\nis still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will\nallow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will\nhave the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins\ncould receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current\nstaking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that\nheavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind\nbased on monetary values.\n\nWe will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.\n\nCommunity Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet\nAs announced in our last Community Update #6\n[https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe], the governance mechanism\nfor the Community Proposals as seen its first iteration make its way onto\ntestnet. We have now released proper builds to test the feature and anyone in\nthe community can now fire up their testnet Particl Desktop client and test the\nnew feature. We highly suggest that you report any issue you encounter during\nyour testing either in our #testing channel on Discord/Telegram or directly on \nGithub [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] as that helps us fix\nthem more quickly.\n\nNote 1: The marketplace currently does not include any governance tool. The\ngovernance mechanism has only been fully integrated into Community Proposals.\nThe marketplace integration of this mechanism is currently underway and will\ncome in a later update.\n\nNote 2: The testnet is currently on hold and not loading properly. This has to\ndo with the upgrade to the new 0.17 codebase.

We still have big plans for <strong>Changelly</strong>, and we definitely think they will help a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide array of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also provide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a lot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.</p><p>As per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our main wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate <strong>Changelly</strong>, but also any other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate Changelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several other services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services. We believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much more adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing them more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.</p><h3 id=\"-4-07-is-it-currently-being-worked-on\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m8s\">4:07</a>) Is it currently being worked on?</h3><p>The team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace and <strong>the integration is not being actively worked on right now</strong> as it hasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to discuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace, but they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that makes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.</p><p>Don’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would make this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities, this will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being currency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.</p><p>We would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently being worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by checking out our <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-10-14-can-the-team-make-atomic-swaps-more-user-friendly\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>) Can the team make atomic swaps more user-friendly?</h3><p>As it currently stands today, <strong>atomic swaps</strong> (the trustless coin exchanging protocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge way to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &amp; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop. A majority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly, and a lot of bug fixes and stability improvements were implemented to make the Particl Desktop experience as smooth as it has ever been! Follow the link above to get all the details about this update.</p><h3 id=\"status-report\">Status Report</h3><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — StatusReport</strong></a><br><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><em>Particl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy * Private…</em></a><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p>We released on the 14th of September a new Status Report on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>. There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

We still have big plans for <strong>Changelly</strong>, and we definitely think they will help a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide array of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also provide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a lot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.</p><p>As per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our main wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate <strong>Changelly</strong>, but also any other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate Changelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several other services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services. We believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much more adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing them more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.</p><h3 id=\"-4-07-is-it-currently-being-worked-on\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=4m8s\">4:07</a>) Is it currently being worked on?</h3><p>The team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace and <strong>the integration is not being actively worked on right now</strong> as it hasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to discuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace, but they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that makes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.</p><p>Don’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would make this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities, this will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being currency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.</p><p>We would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently being worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by checking out our <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-10-14-can-the-team-make-atomic-swaps-more-user-friendly\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>) Can the team make atomic swaps more user-friendly?</h3><p>As it currently stands today, <strong>atomic swaps</strong> (the trustless coin exchanging protocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge way to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &#x26; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop. A majority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly, and a lot of bug fixes and stability improvements were implemented to make the Particl Desktop experience as smooth as it has ever been! Follow the link above to get all the details about this update.</p><h3 id=\"status-report\">Status Report</h3><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — StatusReport</strong></a><br><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><em>Particl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy * Private…</em></a><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p>We released on the 14th of September a new Status Report on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>. There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!\nUnlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be\nentirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this\ndifficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal\nprivacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata\nstripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the\nfuture, including Dandelion++ [https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging\n(using SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html] and\neventually more scalable and leading-edge DSNs\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \nsuch as Loopix\n[https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181]\n, IPFS [https://ipfs.io/], and etc), and much more. With all the data leaks and\nhacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \n(link to case for privacy)\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f].\n\nFurthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed\nvery effective blockchain tracking software that makes tracking public\ncryptocurrency transactions quite trivial\n[https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/]\n. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain\nthan say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with\nprivacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private\nblockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the “if you have nothing to hide,\nyou don’t really need privacy” kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people\nrealize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people.\nPlus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private\nenvironment, which they’ll want to use a solution that’s been designed with this\nas a prime aspect.\n\nBut why does that even matter?\nAs broken down in an earlier article of mine\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f],\nprivacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days\nwhere privacy was associated to people who had “things to hide”.\n\n> In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like \nEquifax\n[https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/a-year-after-the-equifax-data-breach-what-if-nothing-changes-02062051]\n, Facebook\n[http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/facebook-data-sharing-privacy-mobile-companies-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-5208703/]\n, Deloitte [http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/deloitte-hack/], Yahoo\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-dataprotection-yahoo/yahoos-eu-regulator-orders-privacy-changes-over-data-breach-idUSKCN1J32JX]\n, FedEx\n[https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3026819/thousands-of-fedex-customers-private-information-exposed-in-legacy-server-data-breach]\n, Uber [http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/uber-data-breach-security/], Under Armour\n[https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/another-fitness-app-exposes-users-data-a-11055] \nor even Pizza Hut\n[http://www.information-age.com/pizza-hut-suffers-data-breach-123469137/], the\npoor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts,\nthe public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within\nthe last couple of years.\nThe Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\nNowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust\nwith their personal data. In light of…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\n\nBreaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to\nfight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not\nrespect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just\nas bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask?\nBecause blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed,\ntransactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and\nfor vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want\neveryone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold,\ninformation that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized\nmarketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not\nwant anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.\n\nParticl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not\nneed to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything\nhappens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from\na public blockchain.\n\nBuilt as a 100% Decentralized & Trustless Solution\nAnother advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100%\ndecentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just\nas an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by\nSyscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be\nsomeone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead\nto bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact\nthat a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute.\nTalking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay,\nfor example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even\nwhen it shouldn’t.\n\nOn Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow\nis based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep\nboth parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace\nitself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or\ngroup of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with\neither vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the\noriginal, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the\nfirst place.\n\nFun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100%\ntrustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about\nit in some Bitcoin’s repository?\n\nMuch Better & Intuitive User Interface\nParticl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use\nin mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to\nunderstand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said\nof most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or\nbarebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.\n\nAdditionally, Particl plans on developing a web & mobile interface at some point\nin the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about\nit. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as\neasy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile\ninterface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the\nroadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the\nmainnet release of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace AlphaDownload Particl Marketplace Alpha here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\n\nMore recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel: \nhttps://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\n\nParticl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace\nIn the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a\nfull-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its\nroadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer\nout there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a\nsocial media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even\nthe addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will\ntruly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nThe goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms\nlike Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can\nall be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something\nakin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an\nAndroid OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop\nwallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the\nParticl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right\ninto it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp\nplatforms which are generally pretty barebone).\n\nOne of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only\ndecentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure\nsurrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce\ninfrastructure on which the coin can be spent).\n\nTop-Tier Development Team\nThe Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed\nranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (\nhttps://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked\n36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code\nquality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and\nmarketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl\nteam is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach\naccomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking\n(Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with\nSegwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin\ncodebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2\nwith 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin\nitself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though\nthey were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team\nthat is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security\nand decentralization.\n\nTo see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github\nvisualization videos included in this blog post: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\n\nMany Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist\nAs we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or\nalmost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community.\nSame thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and\netc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I\nthink we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors\nwon’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their\npotential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all\nco-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry.\nThis is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can\noffer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for\nsale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they\nare not alone in this space.\n\nWhat I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized\nmarketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand.\nAs such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the\nvalue of Particl considerably. That is because:\n\n * Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they\n   use another coin)\n * More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, \n   up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow as the\n   buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor\n   also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to\n   hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.\n * A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out\n   at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of\n   circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very\n   interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get\n   100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of\n   the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the\n   community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction.\n   Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus\n   anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming\n   staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of\n   holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.\n * Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency.\n   Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the\n   background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting\n   other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It\n   doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!\n\nThe four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized\nmarketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie,\neven a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally\nincrease the price of the coin.

In light of…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Breaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to fight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not respect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just as bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask? Because blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed, transactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and for vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want everyone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold, information that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized marketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not want anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.</p><p>Particl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not need to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything happens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from a public blockchain.</p><h2 id=\"built-as-a-100-decentralized-trustless-solution\">Built as a 100% Decentralized &amp; Trustless Solution</h2><p>Another advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100% decentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just as an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by Syscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be someone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead to bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact that a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute. Talking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay, for example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even when it shouldn’t.</p><p>On Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow is based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep both parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace itself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or group of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with either vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the original, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the first place.</p><p>Fun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100% trustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about it in some Bitcoin’s repository?</p><h2 id=\"much-better-intuitive-user-interface\">Much Better &amp; Intuitive User Interface</h2><p>Particl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use in mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to understand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said of most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or barebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.</p><p>Additionally, Particl plans on developing a web &amp; mobile interface at some point in the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about it. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as easy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile interface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the roadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/What-Makes-Particl-s-Decentralized-Marketplace-Stand-Out-From-its-Competition/0-He_sNQBVTbkHxxHw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Download Particl Marketplace Alpha here: </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha</a></p><p><em><strong>More recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel:</strong></em> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\">https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc</a></p><h2 id=\"particl-is-much-more-than-a-decentralized-marketplace\">Particl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace</h2><p>In the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a full-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace.</p><p>The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone).</p><p>One of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent).</p><h2 id=\"top-tier-development-team\">Top-Tier Development Team</h2><p>The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (<a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\"><strong>https://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa</strong></a>) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization.</p><p>To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\">https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfhGfmuLjo8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"many-decentralized-marketplaces-could-and-probably-will-co-exist\">Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist</h2><p>As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space.</p><p>What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because:</p><ul><li>Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin)</li><li>More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, <strong>up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow</strong> as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.</li><li>A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction. Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.</li><li>Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency. Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!</li></ul><p>The four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized marketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie, even a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally increase the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is one of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their coins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).</p><h2 id=\"third-party-building-on-the-particl-protocol-mubiz-\">Third-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)</h2><p>Another big thing about Particl too is that <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a>, a decentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on implementing the marketplace.

Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace.</p><p>The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone).</p><p>One of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent).</p><h2 id=\"top-tier-development-team\">Top-Tier Development Team</h2><p>The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (<a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\"><strong>https://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa</strong></a>) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization.</p><p>To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\">https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfhGfmuLjo8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"many-decentralized-marketplaces-could-and-probably-will-co-exist\">Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist</h2><p>As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space.</p><p>What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because:</p><ul><li>Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin)</li><li>More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, <strong>up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow</strong> as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.</li><li>A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction. Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.</li><li>Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency. Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!</li></ul><p>The four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized marketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie, even a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally increase the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is one of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their coins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).</p><h2 id=\"third-party-building-on-the-particl-protocol-mubiz-\">Third-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)</h2><p>Another big thing about Particl too is that <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a>, a decentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on implementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the marketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and will offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on Particl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user (read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user experience is no different than eBay), customer support &#x26; product returns, shipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional means of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat payment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.</p><p>Mubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second marketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview I conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with OpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have flaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with Particl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><strong>Interview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface &#x26; Suite of Services Designed for Particl…</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><em>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder of Mubiz, a decentralized marketplace…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Mubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will make Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will be making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn allowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their competitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and cheaper prices for the customer. Surely this should be an attractive solution for most?</p><hr><p>In the end, I think the current bear market in the cryptocurrency scene will make people realize the importance of intrinsic value. What if you take speculation out of the equation? Does that make your favorite coin or token worthless or not?</p><p>This is what makes me so positive about Particl’s future. Its coin has great economics, the technology is top of the line within the crypto industry, and the project is securely funded for quite some time, with a second funding round that should occur next year. Could Particl end up being in a <em>perfect storm<strong> </strong></em>scenario at some point in the future?</p><hr><p><em><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>The information contained herein is not intended to be a source of advice or credit analysis with respect to the material presented, and the information and/or documents contained in this blog post do not constitute investment advice.

Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry.

Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction.

The Particl discussion forum is now\nlive and ready to use! This new platform will allow the entire community as well\nas Particl team members to communicate in a new, more organized way than on a\nchat platform. It has already been populated with content such as articles,\ntutorials, posts, news, archived discussions, and more to help kickstart it.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive right in into what this platform is going to\nbring to the Particl community!\n\nFORUM LINK: https://particl.community\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore Details\nDiscourse\nOur new discussion forum [https://particl.community] is based on Discourse\n[http://discourse.com], a slick-looking and high-performance forum platform\ndesigned for the modern-day internet. In fact, Discourse is a very smooth\nplatform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well\nas enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in\nvarious situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse\nsetup:\n\nStructured Discussions\nThis new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the\ncommunity. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within\nthe community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as\nTelegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with\nyour peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.\n\nParticl Forum’s HomepageIn fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and\nDiscord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation\nthey create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general.\nMoreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at\nsome point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal\nset up, especially when it comes to help & support; different users will often\nbe asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of\nchatter to see if their question has already been answered.\n\nLet’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to\nits full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the\nbigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to\nthe very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to\nprepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users.\nFurthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by\nmillions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not\ncryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms,\nhaving a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something\nthat will make life easier for a lot of people.\n\nCentral Point of Information\nParticl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information\nsurrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki\nalready does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl\norganized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support\nrequired by a user and later marked as solved will be easy to dig back out and\nlink back to any other user having similar issues.\n\nAny article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users,\nand this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help\nnewcomers quickly find the information they are looking for. This is but one\nmore step towards making Particl information more accessible to as many people\nas possible!\n\nHelp & Support\nAmong the many categories that are initially included with the Particl forum is\na Help & Support category. We strongly believe this category to be an absolute\nrequirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much\neasier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll\nweeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported\nour Particl Wiki [http://particl.wiki]’s FAQ into a pinned thread\n[https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2] so that users\ncould easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask\ntheir questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread\nso that it could be added to it upon resolving.\n\nMoreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and\ninstinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the\nmainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will\nbecome a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may\nactually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or\nDiscord.\n\nArchived Discussions\nArchived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl\nforum but are archived on it. The reason these discussions are getting archived\non the Particl Forum [https://particl.community/tags/archive] is that they are\nthought of as constructive, interesting, and in general, adding value to the\nbroader Particl discussion.\n\nAs mentioned throughout this post, many of the platforms we are on (i.e.\nTelegram, Discord, etc) are not ideal when it comes to preserving discussions\nand making them easily accessible. Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a\nmuch more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts,\nhence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for\nall to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.\n\nNote: There is no “Archives” category. We prefer putting every archived\ndiscussion within the category it fits in to make them easier to find. You can,\nhowever, simply select the archive [https://particl.community/tags/archive] tag\nto filter all the forum posts and only display archived posts. To do so, go to\nthe main page of the forum and select archive\n[https://particl.community/tags/archive] as the tag filter.\n\nFor more information about archived discussions, visit this thread: \nhttps://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79\n\nFor a good example of an archived discussions, read What is Dandelion?\n[https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n\nSelf-Governance\nAn interesting feature of the Discourse platform is that it allows, not too\nunlike Particl Marketplace, the community to govern itself. In fact, Discourse\nincludes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide\ninappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching\ntogether trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the\nhighest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them\nto keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users\ntrust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for\nthe most time and have made quality contributions to it.\n\nTo learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article\nposted on the official Discourse blog: \nhttps://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\n\nParticl Proposal Discussions\nAs many of you already know, our development team has been working on the \nProject Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create,\nsubmit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6].\nParticl Desktop does not, however, support proposal discussions. These proposal\ndiscussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus\nreaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about\nthem.\n\nThe Particl forum contains a Proposals\n[https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals] sub-category within\nthe General [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion] category. Because\nParticl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is\nrecommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit\nit to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the\nsubmission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a\nspecific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion\nand for all voters to see.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFun Social Features\nNot only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of fun and\nsocial features! In fact, we’ve added a lot of plugins to the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, including a custom-theme, that makes hanging on the Particl forum a\nreal treat.\n\nUser Cards\nCryptoguard’s User CardUser cards are a small profile summary attached to every\nuser that can be displayed simply by clicking on the user’s avatar. They display\na lot of useful information about the user in question such as social media\nplatform usernames, forum statistics, title, and badges. They allow users to\nquickly preview another user’s profile without requiring to quit the page or\nthread they’re currently on. This is an excellent way to display your forum\nachievements and activity to the rest of the community as well as making\nyourself easier to reach out to on any platform you’re on!\n\nBadges\nA few examples of custom badges made for the Particl forumBadges are forum\n“achievements” you acquire throughout your journey on the Particl forum and are\nmeant to showcase to the rest of the community your involvement within the\nproject. On top of the default badges included in the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, we’ve added a few of them (such as Wiki Contributor, Alpha Tester, \nBug Finder, Coin Swapper, and etc) to highlight some of our own milestones and\ncommunity achievements. They are an excellent way to build a reputation for\nyourself and showcase your support and involvement in the project! For a list of\nthe currently available badges, visit the forum’s badges page\n[https://particl.community/badges]. Note that more badges will be added as we\nmove forward and receive suggestions from the community.\n\nReactions\nYou can react to posts and threads the same way you can do it on Discord or\nSlack. Indeed, on top of the “like” function that comes with the default version\nof Discourse, we’ve added a plugin which allows users to “react” on posts using\nany emojis. Don’t be afraid to show how you feel about a certain post! ?\n\nPolls\nExample of a poll within a threadPolls are going to be useful for anyone that\nwants to poll the community about a certain issue, matter, or question. Up until\nnow, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”),\na set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you\ncouldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was\ngetting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls\nalso do not allow for very complex sets of options.\n\nWith the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced\nby a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a\nforum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private\nsolution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient\n(doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put\nmany options and include much more details) way to do it.\n\nSwap Angels\nBack when the community decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to\naccommodate late swappers\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it was\ndiscussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly,\nreceive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation. As we\nslowly, but surely, head towards the mainnet release of the long-awaited Particl\nMarketplace, we believe that now would be a great time to celebrate our generous\nveteran holders who have donated some of their personal funds to help and rescue\nlate swappers.\n\nAs of today, donors to the initiative will be able to display a special badge, \nflair, title or any combination of those on their profile and user card. These\noptional options can be granted to donors’ Particl forum accounts simply by\nsending a message containing your Particl Portal username as well as whether you\nwould like to be displayed on the Hall of Fame thread or not to Cryptoguard\n[https://particl.community/u/cryptoguard/summary].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Resources\nTutorial\nIf you would like to follow an interactive tutorial that will show you the basic\nfunctions of Discourse, simply read the message from @discobot that you will\nautomatically receive in your inbox upon signing up and follow through his\ninstructions. The bot will guide you through all the basic stuff through an\ninteractive tutorial and help you get started!\n\nDiscourse\nDiscourse’s Official Website [https://www.discourse.org/]\n\nDiscourse Vanilla Features [https://www.discourse.org/features.html]\n\nNew User Tips & Tricks\n[https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-tips-and-tricks/54341/20]\n\nUnderstanding Trust Levels\n[https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/]\n\nFormatting Help [https://commonmark.org/help/]\n\nParticl Forum\nParticl Forum Link [https://particl.community]\n\nArchived Discussions [https://particl.community/tags/archive]\n\nParticl Proposals [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals]\n\nBadges Page [https://particl.community/badges]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo now that you are done reading this introduction post, it’s time to #BePART of\nthe discourse!

These proposal discussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus reaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about them.</p><p>The Particl forum contains a <a href=\"https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals\"><strong>Proposals</strong></a><strong> </strong>sub-category within the <a href=\"https://particl.community/c/general-discussion\"><strong>General</strong></a> category. Because Particl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is recommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit it to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the submission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a specific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion and for all voters to see.</p><hr><h2 id=\"fun-social-features\"><strong>Fun Social Features</strong></h2><p>Not only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of <strong>fun and social </strong>features!

Discord polls also do not allow for very complex sets of options.</p><p>With the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced by a link and are opened to every member of the community.

In fact, Discourse is a very smooth platform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well as enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in various situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse setup:</p><h3 id=\"structured-discussions\"><strong>Structured Discussions</strong></h3><p>This new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the community. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within the community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as Telegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with your peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-yaWqiLCzUjOfiIEUk0pU0w.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Forum’s Homepage</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and Discord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation they create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general. Moreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at some point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal set up, especially when it comes to help &#x26; support; different users will often be asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of chatter to see if their question has already been answered.</p><p>Let’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to its full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the bigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to the very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to prepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users. Furthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by millions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not cryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms, having a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something that will make life easier for a lot of people.</p><h3 id=\"central-point-of-information\">Central Point of Information</h3><p>Particl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information surrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki already does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl organized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support required by a user and later marked as <strong>solved</strong> will be easy to dig back out and link back to any other user having similar issues.</p><p>Any article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users, and this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help newcomers quickly find the information they are looking for. This is but one more step towards making Particl information more accessible to as many people as possible!</p><h3 id=\"help-support\"><strong>Help &#x26; Support</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-jZZZIZK1bYf5U8RhPMDc6A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Among the many categories that are initially included with the Particl forum is a <strong>Help &#x26; Support</strong> category. We strongly believe this category to be an absolute requirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much easier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll weeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported our <a href=\"http://particl.wiki\">Particl Wiki</a>’s FAQ into a <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2\"><strong>pinned thread</strong></a> so that users could easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask their questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread so that it could be added to it upon resolving.</p><p>Moreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and instinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the mainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will become a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may actually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or Discord.</p><h3 id=\"archived-discussions\">Archived Discussions</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-C2U3BiLI1zUUQ-TuNdZkRw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Archived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl forum but are archived on it. The reason these discussions are <a href=\"https://particl.community/tags/archive\">getting archived on the Particl Forum</a> is that they are thought of as constructive, interesting, and in general, adding value to the broader Particl discussion.</p><p>As mentioned throughout this post, many of the platforms we are on (i.e. Telegram, Discord, etc) are not ideal when it comes to preserving discussions and making them easily accessible. Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a much more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts, hence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for all to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>There is no “Archives” category. We prefer putting every archived discussion within the category it fits in to make them easier to find. You can, however, simply select the </em><a href=\"https://particl.community/tags/archive\"><em><strong>archive</strong></em></a><em> tag to filter all the forum posts and only display archived posts. To do so, go to the main page of the forum and select </em><a href=\"https://particl.community/tags/archive\"><em><strong>archive</strong></em></a><em> as the tag filter.</em></p><p>For more information about archived discussions, visit this thread: <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79\"><strong>https://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79</strong></a></p><p>For a good example of an archived discussions, read <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78\"><strong>What is Dandelion?</strong></a></p><h3 id=\"self-governance\">Self-Governance</h3><p>An interesting feature of the Discourse platform is that it allows, not too unlike Particl Marketplace, the community to govern itself. In fact, Discourse includes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide inappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching together trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the highest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them to keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users trust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for the most time and have made quality contributions to it.</p><p>To learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article posted on the official Discourse blog: <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\">https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/</a></p><h3 id=\"particl-proposal-discussions\">Particl Proposal Discussions</h3><p>As many of you already know, our development team has been working on the <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create, submit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet</a>.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\n(4:50 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=4m50s]) Could you start communicating a\nbit about the upcoming funding round?\nWe’ve stated in the past that our lead group will be discussing the next funding\nround when we meet later this year. To be honest, we haven’t had any formal\ncommunication on it, only thoughts and ideas were bounced around and we will try\nto share those with the community as they come up. The second funding round will\nbe one of the main talking points of our next team meeting and we’ll have a plan\nof attack after that time.\n\n(6:14 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=6m14s]) You said you want to rise about 20\nmillion USD, you only have around 1 million coins to sell for the second\nfunding round…\nThe numbers that we have gathered over a year history of managing a\ndecentralized team and with a good array of active and future products make us\nfeel comfortable in seeking $20 million in funding. That number, although could\nchange, would be all that is needed to ensure the continuous development of the\nParticl project for as long as people want to use its privacy-focused and\ndecentralized applications.\n\n(8:10 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=8m10s]) I am wondering if the low price of\nthe particl coin is an issue for this funding round\nIn order to raise around $20 million dollars, the price of the Particl coin\nwould indeed need to be at or around 20 dollars. This will be taken into account\nduring our next team meeting when we craft our funding strategy. We may also,\nshould we have enough funds left from the previous funding round, postpone the\nfunding round until more favorable market conditions arise. In other words,\nthere is nothing set in stone yet and we will keep the community updated with\nthe funding structure as we move forward after the meeting.\n\n(9:14 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=9m14s]) How many investors will\nparticipate in this funding round?\nWe have a collection of inquiries that have already voiced an interest and\nreached out to us about the funding round. This will 99% most likely be a\nprivate funding round, not an ICO or community funding event. That will be\nnailed down, as with the rest of the funding strategy, during our next team\nmeeting later this year.\n\n(10:24 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=10m24s]) If we have only one (or a few)\ninvestors, then a very large part of the supply will be held by one (or a few)\nholders. Any thoughts on this?\nWe’ve discussed (again, just brainstorming at this point) having PART lots with\nminimum and maximum buy orders per investment group. For example, a minimum\ncould be 1,000 PART lots or the max could be 10,000 PART lots. We don’t know yet\nhow exactly we’ll be going on about it but it’ll absolutely be done in a manner\nthat respects the integrity of the network, its decentralization as well as its\ncommunity, even if that means ruling our some potential investors that’d be a\nbit a too aggressive in their tactics.\n\n(11:55 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=11m55s]) I think these coins being put in\ncirculation could scare future buyers. Do you plan to set some specific rules so\nthese investors cannot dump their coins on the market?\nWe haven’t talked anything about the terms & conditions of the round. Typically\nprivate investment rounds have rules and participants are less impulsive than\ndaytraders or casual investors. Details will be worked out with our legal teams\ntoo, but again, this has yet to happen. As mentioned above, everything will be\ndone in the most responsible manner possible and will put the integrity and\nhealth of the network first.\n\n(13:57 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=13m57s]) Do you have any kind of plan B\nin case you can’t raise the amount you need?\nThere are two scenarios that could happen. The first one is that we can’t raise\nthe amount we need to and then have to postpone any funding round until the\nmarket conditions (or the investor pool) are more favorable. Note that, as we\nhave secured the salaries and funds required to support the project until at\nleast April of next year, that leaves a lot of time for market conditions to\nturn around and for Particl to turn some heads. It is also far from excluded\nthat these funds could last for longer than that, so in reality, there could\nstill be quite a long time until the moment the project outright requires more\nfunds to survive.\n\nThe second scenario is that the market conditions are more than favorable, we\nraise the amount that we are seeking to raise, but don’t use the full 996,000\nPART coins to do so. This would present more options to improve the network by\npossibly conducting a burn event of the extra PART coins that weren’t required,\nor set up new funds for marketing, community stimulation, development, events,\nphilanthropy, acquisitions, even a fund for future funding rounds, and etc. This\nwould present itself as the ideal scenario as that would give us an unlimited\nnumber of options on how to best spend these leftover funds.\n\n(18:44 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=18m44s]) The word on Discord is that\nstaking pools will be available soon — any information or ETA on that?\nTecnovert has been working on staking pools on both testnet and mainnet\nnetworks. He has gotten rather far so far with it but it is still in testing\nmode. We may be able to see or participate in some of the testing on the testnet\none at some point in time soon.\n\nAs for an ETA, it’s pretty hard to tell as he may very well switch back over to\nRingCT and planning the upcoming hardfork as we near that event. RingCT is ready\nfor mainnet and the governance bit (see the Status Report\n[https://particl.io/status-report] and this tweet\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1037773807145181185]) is moving\nsmoothly.\n\nLong story short, higher priorities may pull him away from staking pools, but\nyes, there are prototypes.\n\n(23:29 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=23m29s]) How is it possible that the\nremaining funds from the first funding round will only last until April 2019?\nTo clarify, the funds going to April 2019 are only salaries which were hedged in\nadvance to ensure that we could pay contributors in the case of any crazy market\nhappenings (see 2018). There is, of course, more funds in the Particl Foundation\ncoffers which could be requested by the Particl team should it need additional\nfundings to cover salaries and operations past April 2019.\n\n(28:46 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=28m46s]) How can one pay for services\nsuch as featuring or highlighting their products on Particl Marketplace?\nThis is not going to be part of the initial version of Particl Marketplace on\nmainnet, but we see this feature as being very useful. It is not something\nthat’s part of our roadmap, yet, and it might come faster if some third-party\ndeveloper builds it using the coming SDK tools, but we might end up tackling it\nourselves at some point in the future.

It’s\nnot part of our roadmap just yet but is something we’ve identified as something\nwe want to work on eventually. There is still a lot of research that needs to be\ndone in order to make it as efficient and accurate as possible (i.e. make it\nharder to fake reviews), and also do so in a way that entirely preserves users’\nidentities.\n\n(34:30 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=34m30s]) Will it have a user reputation\nmechanism?\nIt is still a floating idea, but we may never have a reputation system if it\nproves to be detrimental to one’s privacy/security (since we are, after all, a\nprivacy-focused project). It also might be hard to do without it being able to\nbe gamed by users which would thus make it more or less useless. As we stand\nright now, we are tentatively opting for a model that is going to make use of\ngovernance paired with reviews rather than a “reputation” system.\n\n(39:01 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s]) Does PART have a reorganization\nlimit making long range attacks impossible?\nParticl Proof-of-Stake doesn’t have a reorganization limit. This attack is\nmostly based on weak subjectivity which only works if a bad actor convinced the\nother nodes to download a modified client from a bad source. While they might\nhave the resources to reorganize the blocks, they’d also need to trick people\ninto using their own client and not the official one. This is one of the reasons\nwe very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our \nofficial website [http://particl.io/downloads] or from our Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] as well as always \nverifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files\n[https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads].\n\nMore technical details revealed by Paul here\n[https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s].\n\n(43:36 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s]) Does it have Economic Clustering\nwhich makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the\nchain where the other important nodes are?\n​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically\nincludes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same\nchain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on\nit, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the\nend all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:\n\n> Tecnovert: PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight\nover time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part\nfor a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in\nsuccession.

Cold staking\n[https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc] \nis one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring\nto expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users\nchoose to use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet\n[https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495]\n, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever,\ndramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually\nrequires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the\nstaking process.\n\nThe Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake\nresearch specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on\naround the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if\nnot the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm.

To be honest, we haven’t had any formal communication on it, only thoughts and ideas were bounced around and we will try to share those with the community as they come up. The second funding round will be one of the main talking points of our next team meeting and we’ll have a plan of attack after that time.</p><h3 id=\"-6-14-you-said-you-want-to-rise-about-20-million-usd-you-only-have-around-1-million-coins-to-sell-for-the-second-funding-round-\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=6m14s\">6:14</a>) You said you want to rise about 20 million USD, you only have around 1 million coins to sell for the second funding round…</h3><p>The numbers that we have gathered over a year history of managing a decentralized team and with a good array of active and future products make us feel comfortable in seeking $20 million in funding. That number, although could change, would be all that is needed to ensure the continuous development of the Particl project for as long as people want to use its privacy-focused and decentralized applications.</p><h3 id=\"-8-10-i-am-wondering-if-the-low-price-of-the-particl-coin-is-an-issue-for-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=8m10s\">8:10</a>) I am wondering if the low price of the particl coin is an issue for this funding round</h3><p>In order to raise around $20 million dollars, the price of the Particl coin would indeed need to be at or around 20 dollars. This will be taken into account during our next team meeting when we craft our funding strategy. We may also, should we have enough funds left from the previous funding round, postpone the funding round until more favorable market conditions arise. In other words, there is nothing set in stone yet and we will keep the community updated with the funding structure as we move forward after the meeting.</p><h3 id=\"-9-14-how-many-investors-will-participate-in-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=9m14s\">9:14</a>) How many investors will participate in this funding round?</h3><p>We have a collection of inquiries that have already voiced an interest and reached out to us about the funding round. This will 99% most likely be a private funding round, not an ICO or community funding event. That will be nailed down, as with the rest of the funding strategy, during our next team meeting later this year.</p><h3 id=\"-10-24-if-we-have-only-one-or-a-few-investors-then-a-very-large-part-of-the-supply-will-be-held-by-one-or-a-few-holders-any-thoughts-on-this\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=10m24s\">10:24</a>) If we have only one (or a few) investors, then a very large part of the supply will be held by one (or a few) holders.

For example, a minimum could be 1,000 PART lots or the max could be 10,000 PART lots. We don’t know yet how exactly we’ll be going on about it but it’ll absolutely be done in a manner that respects the integrity of the network, its decentralization as well as its community, even if that means ruling our some potential investors that’d be a bit a too aggressive in their tactics.</p><h3 id=\"-11-55-i-think-these-coins-being-put-in-circulation-could-scare-future-buyers-do-you-plan-to-set-some-specific-rules-so-these-investors-cannot-dump-their-coins-on-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=11m55s\">11:55</a>) I think these coins being put in circulation could scare future buyers.

A 500 block reorganization limit (for example) wouldn’t have stopped that though”<strong>Dasource</strong> “ I agree…I wonder what the other rationale was behind it...since most attacks related to stake weight would have been less than a dozen blocks in which case it would have never helped as the default setting (in pre-PoSv3 versions) was 500”<br></blockquote><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-47-35-is-particl-making-any-effort-into-researching-and-improving-proof-of-stake\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=47m35s\">47:35</a>) Is Particl making any effort into researching and improving Proof-of-Stake?</h3><p>While the team is not solely focusing on working on Proof-of-stake and making a PoSv4, we are still improving our own PoS mechanism by making it more secure than most of its counterpart. <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc\">Cold staking</a> is one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring to expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users choose to <a href=\"https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495\">use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet</a>, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever, dramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually requires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the staking process.</p><p>The Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake research specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on around the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if not the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm.

To be honest, we haven’t had any formal communication on it, only thoughts and ideas were bounced around and we will try to share those with the community as they come up. The second funding round will be one of the main talking points of our next team meeting and we’ll have a plan of attack after that time.</p><h3 id=\"-6-14-you-said-you-want-to-rise-about-20-million-usd-you-only-have-around-1-million-coins-to-sell-for-the-second-funding-round-\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=6m14s\">6:14</a>) You said you want to rise about 20 million USD, you only have around 1 million coins to sell for the second funding round…</h3><p>The numbers that we have gathered over a year history of managing a decentralized team and with a good array of active and future products make us feel comfortable in seeking $20 million in funding. That number, although could change, would be all that is needed to ensure the continuous development of the Particl project for as long as people want to use its privacy-focused and decentralized applications.</p><h3 id=\"-8-10-i-am-wondering-if-the-low-price-of-the-particl-coin-is-an-issue-for-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=8m10s\">8:10</a>) I am wondering if the low price of the particl coin is an issue for this funding round</h3><p>In order to raise around $20 million dollars, the price of the Particl coin would indeed need to be at or around 20 dollars. This will be taken into account during our next team meeting when we craft our funding strategy. We may also, should we have enough funds left from the previous funding round, postpone the funding round until more favorable market conditions arise. In other words, there is nothing set in stone yet and we will keep the community updated with the funding structure as we move forward after the meeting.</p><h3 id=\"-9-14-how-many-investors-will-participate-in-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=9m14s\">9:14</a>) How many investors will participate in this funding round?</h3><p>We have a collection of inquiries that have already voiced an interest and reached out to us about the funding round. This will 99% most likely be a private funding round, not an ICO or community funding event. That will be nailed down, as with the rest of the funding strategy, during our next team meeting later this year.</p><h3 id=\"-10-24-if-we-have-only-one-or-a-few-investors-then-a-very-large-part-of-the-supply-will-be-held-by-one-or-a-few-holders-any-thoughts-on-this\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=10m24s\">10:24</a>) If we have only one (or a few) investors, then a very large part of the supply will be held by one (or a few) holders. Any thoughts on this?</h3><p>We’ve discussed (again, just brainstorming at this point) having PART lots with minimum and maximum buy orders per investment group. For example, a minimum could be 1,000 PART lots or the max could be 10,000 PART lots. We don’t know yet how exactly we’ll be going on about it but it’ll absolutely be done in a manner that respects the integrity of the network, its decentralization as well as its community, even if that means ruling our some potential investors that’d be a bit a too aggressive in their tactics.</p><h3 id=\"-11-55-i-think-these-coins-being-put-in-circulation-could-scare-future-buyers-do-you-plan-to-set-some-specific-rules-so-these-investors-cannot-dump-their-coins-on-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=11m55s\">11:55</a>) I think these coins being put in circulation could scare future buyers. Do you plan to set some specific rules so these investors cannot dump their coins on the market?</h3><p>We haven’t talked anything about the terms &#x26; conditions of the round. Typically private investment rounds have rules and participants are less impulsive than daytraders or casual investors. Details will be worked out with our legal teams too, but again, this has yet to happen. As mentioned above, everything will be done in the most responsible manner possible and will put the integrity and health of the network first.</p><h3 id=\"-13-57-do-you-have-any-kind-of-plan-b-in-case-you-can-t-raise-the-amount-you-need\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=13m57s\">13:57</a>) Do you have any kind of plan B in case you can’t raise the amount you need?</h3><p>There are two scenarios that could happen. The first one is that we can’t raise the amount we need to and then have to postpone any funding round until the market conditions (or the investor pool) are more favorable. Note that, as we have secured the salaries and funds required to support the project until at least April of next year, that leaves a lot of time for market conditions to turn around and for Particl to turn some heads. It is also far from excluded that these funds could last for longer than that, so in reality, there could still be quite a long time until the moment the project outright requires more funds to survive.</p><p>The second scenario is that the market conditions are more than favorable, we raise the amount that we are seeking to raise, but don’t use the full 996,000 PART coins to do so. This would present more options to improve the network by possibly conducting a burn event of the extra PART coins that weren’t required, or set up new funds for marketing, community stimulation, development, events, philanthropy, acquisitions, even a fund for future funding rounds, and etc. This would present itself as the ideal scenario as that would give us an unlimited number of options on how to best spend these leftover funds.</p><h3 id=\"-18-44-the-word-on-discord-is-that-staking-pools-will-be-available-soon-any-information-or-eta-on-that\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=18m44s\">18:44</a>) The word on Discord is that staking pools will be available soon — any information or ETA on that?</h3><p>Tecnovert has been working on staking pools on both testnet and mainnet networks. He has gotten rather far so far with it but it is still in testing mode. We may be able to see or participate in some of the testing on the testnet one at some point in time soon.</p><p>As for an ETA, it’s pretty hard to tell as he may very well switch back over to RingCT and planning the upcoming hardfork as we near that event. RingCT is ready for mainnet and the governance bit (see the <a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report\">Status Report</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1037773807145181185\">this tweet</a>) is moving smoothly.</p><p>Long story short, higher priorities may pull him away from staking pools, but yes, there are prototypes.</p><h3 id=\"-23-29-how-is-it-possible-that-the-remaining-funds-from-the-first-funding-round-will-only-last-until-april-2019\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=23m29s\">23:29</a>) How is it possible that the remaining funds from the first funding round will only last until April 2019?</h3><p>To clarify, the funds going to April 2019 are only salaries which were hedged in advance to ensure that we could pay contributors in the case of any crazy market happenings (see 2018). There is, of course, more funds in the Particl Foundation coffers which could be requested by the Particl team should it need additional fundings to cover salaries and operations past April 2019.</p><h3 id=\"-28-46-how-can-one-pay-for-services-such-as-featuring-or-highlighting-their-products-on-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=28m46s\">28:46</a>) How can one pay for services such as featuring or highlighting their products on Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>This is not going to be part of the initial version of Particl Marketplace on mainnet, but we see this feature as being very useful. It is not something that’s part of our roadmap, yet, and it might come faster if some third-party developer builds it using the coming SDK tools, but we might end up tackling it ourselves at some point in the future. Vendors are going to want tools to promote themselves and increase their sales, we are aware of this and will be something that is most probably end up being part of Particl, whether it’s part of Particl Desktop or third-party services like <a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\">Mubiz</a>, for example!</p><h3 id=\"-32-31-will-the-marketplace-have-reviews\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=32m31s\">32:31</a>) Will the marketplace have reviews?</h3><p>There will probably be reviews and it is planned in some form or another. It’s not part of our roadmap just yet but is something we’ve identified as something we want to work on eventually. There is still a lot of research that needs to be done in order to make it as efficient and accurate as possible (i.e. make it harder to fake reviews), and also do so in a way that entirely preserves users’ identities.</p><h3 id=\"-34-30-will-it-have-a-user-reputation-mechanism\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=34m30s\">34:30</a>) Will it have a user reputation mechanism?</h3><p>It is still a floating idea, but we may never have a reputation system if it proves to be detrimental to one’s privacy/security (since we are, after all, a privacy-focused project). It also might be hard to do without it being able to be gamed by users which would thus make it more or less useless. As we stand right now, we are tentatively opting for a model that is going to make use of governance paired with reviews rather than a “reputation” system.</p><h3 id=\"-39-01-does-part-have-a-reorganization-limit-making-long-range-attacks-impossible\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\">39:01</a>) Does PART have a reorganization limit making long range attacks impossible?</h3><p>Particl Proof-of-Stake doesn’t have a reorganization limit. This attack is mostly based on weak subjectivity which only works if a bad actor convinced the other nodes to download a modified client from a bad source. While they might have the resources to reorganize the blocks, they’d also need to trick people into using their own client and not the official one. This is one of the reasons we very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our <a href=\"http://particl.io/downloads\">official website</a> or from our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Github page</a> as well as always <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads\">verifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files</a>.</p><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-43-36-does-it-have-economic-clustering-which-makes-it-possible-for-forgers-to-detect-forks-early-and-switch-to-the-chain-where-the-other-important-nodes-are\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\">43:36</a>) Does it have Economic Clustering which makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the chain where the other important nodes are?</h3><p>​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically includes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same chain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on it, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the end all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:</p><blockquote><strong>Tecnovert:</strong> PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight over time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part for a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in succession.

Particl is consistently ranked\nfirst among privacy coins as well as decentralized marketplaces! CryptoMiso\n[https://cryptomiso.com/], another Github monitoring rating group, currently\nranks Particl in 15th place out of a total of 867 ranked projects within the\nlast 12 months.\n\nWhat if there was a way to visualize Particl’s development history in a more\nuser-friendly way than to manually scan Github stats?\nWith the help of the open-source Github visualizer software Gource\n[http://gource.io/], we produced a series of videos demonstrating the constant\nand impressive work our development team has put into Particl since its\ninception (and the weeks leading up to it).\n\nIn the following videos, you will see visualizations of Particl’s Github\nactivity throughout time. Each moving user you see is a developer that has had\nactivity recorded on one of the displayed repositories. Remember, as we\nconstantly keep our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s, this time-lapse video is\na testament to the cooperation of our 2 teams display.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to cold vote with funds stored on a Ledger Nano S?\nYes. Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to\nuse the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins\nthat have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be\npart of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give\nany kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our\ndevelopment team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of\nsecurity shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the\nParticl community.\n\nWill Particl be added on Coinbase?\nImran, our Commercial & Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for\nnew exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones.\nThere is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and\nare positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the\n“exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the\nmarketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money\nwhere our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however,\ntell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly\nannounce it.\n\nWe have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more\nprofessional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a\nsolid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list\nus, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might\nnot go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.\n\nAs for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins\nand will work on seizing that opportunity!\n\nWill private listings be able to be governed by the community?\nBoth public and private listings will be governable by the community\nexclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface\nof the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out\nby the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.\n\nThat is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be\ntaken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the\nentire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this\nthreshold should be much harder to reach.\n\nThis will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so\naway from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly\ninappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to\nclean its marketplace from it.\n\nAs for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other\nparty other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate\nout as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high\nfor any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over\nit.\n\nWhen I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show\nup on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s\nthoughts about this?\nWe believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project,\nat least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there,\nhaving only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be\ndue to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller\ncommunity, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms\nsuch as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on\nthe web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick\nup.\n\nIt’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized\nmarketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application\nplatform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the\ndecentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many\nother perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy,\nsecurity, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have\nbeen added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of\nblockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are\nbuilding Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our\nstrongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified\ndiscussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of\nusers.\n\nFollowing a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not\nheavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of\ndevelopment as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when\nbuilding a platform as complex as Particl is.\n\nWhile this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the\nfirst mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have\ncontributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing\ndecentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will\nrequire time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for\nexample, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our\nforum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great\ndiscussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and\nweb-based platform. Please see the dedicated forum section of this update\nfurther down the page.\n\nA while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating\nany of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML\nidentifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?\nIt is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration)\nrequire KYC/AML identification of users on their end to be utilized to their\nfull potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for\nthe Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.\n\nFor clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to\nknow our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess\nthe interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX =\n1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for\npeople wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility\nusually associated with the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and\nwill always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT\ncapabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD\nescrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART\ncoins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and\nis required for them to execute.\n\nStable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow\nusers to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable\nmeans to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the\nParticl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give\neach other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience\nregular people are used to dealing with.\n\nNote that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML\nidentifications, but that will always we offered as an option and will never be\nmandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.\n\nIs the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and\nif so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?\nYes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates\nvulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to\nmitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on\nDiscord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about\nhow we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack\nprecisely.\n\nIs the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks\nas indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or\nWSA’s security audit?\nYes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue\nwas found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many\nof you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we\nlaunched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for\nmainnet implementation.\n\nNote that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the\nmarketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for\nmainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users\nto be aware of it coming.\n\nIs RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace\nmainnet?\nMost likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time\nas the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the\nmarketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into\nBulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce\nprivacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.\n\nThe first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting\nto RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for\nthe marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would\nrelease without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for\na while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated\nabout this as we know more.\n\nWhat is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what\nimpact would that carry for the Particl project?\nMOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the\nParticl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &\nBranding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we\ndid in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.\n\nWhile we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did\nsuggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it\nto Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both\ncommunities.\n\nWhat makes Particl better than its competition?\nParticl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact\nthat we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from\nOpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as\nthey are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nBut the most important factors which makes us much different than any of our\ncompetitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization\nwithout compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace,\nit is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they\nemploy moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form\nof escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to\nbe hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it\nalso leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow\nagent and one of the parties involved.\n\nWhile it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party,\nit is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party\nto make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace\ntransaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if\none of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where\nmoderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to\nthe participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you\ncan refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\n\nAre there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences\nand meetups?\nAbsolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we\nnoticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show\nfor, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of\nattention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by\nthe number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells\nus that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we\nreceived from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.\n\nOur budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development\nphase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping\n“vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences,\ncrypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go\nthrough our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than\nwe did during the coin swap.\n\nWe would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl\nin meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such\nevent, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you\nwould need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact\nPaul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community\nManager, if you are interested.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!\nWe announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed\nfrom Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the\ntime of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was\navailable. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a\nproper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, making Particl\nthe world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol. To enable your Ledger Nano S\nhardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this\ntutorial: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\n\nNote: While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the\nmore advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of\nthe more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you\nwait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.\n\nNew Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit\nAs mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and\noversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially\nworking on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on\nAugust 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code\nand has even pushed his first commit\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113], a rather large one, on\nGithub which shows great professionalism. In fact, zaSmilingIdiot\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] has a lot of experience working with large\nteams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our\nproject and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\n\nIt is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests,\nGithub will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes\nand updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This\ncan be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.\n\nPull Request Updates IndicatorNew Status Report Published Includes New Exciting\nDevelopments\nSpeaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status\nReport showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our\nlast Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review”\ncategory, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing\nphase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (which is already available to\nanyone as a stable mainnet pre-release\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) and the\nlong-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0). If all the testing\ngoes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the\nother on Particl Marketplace Alpha (can be downloaded here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) in the coming\nweeks.\n\nStaking Pools Incoming!\nOne of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the\ninclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category.\nThis is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible\noptions to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl\nnetwork by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact,\nTecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool\nproof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive\nconstant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands,\nanyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with\nsmaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in\n~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to\nwait several months in between staking rewards.\n\nWith a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool\nwhich has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments,\nsimilarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up\ntheir hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.\n\nMore details about this feature will be given at a later time.\n\nMarketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!\nOur governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the\nlast few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start\nbeing integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark\na very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be\ntentatively expected for the new few weeks.\n\nWe hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these\nfeatures, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made,\nand such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more\nquickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to\nfall into place!\n\nA New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its\nInception\nToday we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come\nout next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able\nto produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that\nour development team has put into Particl since its inception.\n\nIn this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with\ntheir names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names\nwritten in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development\nrepositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are\nexcluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and\nother repos instrumental to the development of the project.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are\nregardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping\nour codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts\nthe project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core\nat all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting\nus all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments\nmade over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as\nParticl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!\n\nThe PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!\nWe announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX\ncommunity to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the\nParticl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace\ntransactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get\nlisted on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate\ntogether for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and\ndecentralization (more details here: \nhttps://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379).\n\nThe voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that\nthe proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands,\nthe votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very\nhappy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and\ncooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it\nas a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the\nstart of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two\nprojects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required\nto be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more\njoint proposals appearing in the future.\n\nTo track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: \nhttp://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\n\nDownload and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the\nmarketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major\nchanges (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl\nDesktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download Particl\nDesktop 1.2.2 [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2] \ntoday in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is\na major update on the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A\nmajority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more\nuser-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!\n\nMore Updates Being Made to the Website\nOur official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and\nupdates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently\nrevamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a\nwider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is Coin\nSpecifications [https://particl.io/coin-specifications/], a page entirely\ndedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects\nof the Particl coin and blockchain.\n\nTo see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on\nGithub here: https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\n\nForum Update\nAlmost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final\nemail issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases,\nconfirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either\nnot reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which\nisn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.\n\nIf you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some\nfeedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord\nand he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the\nregistration email.\n\nBitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped\nAt the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are\nalso working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely\noutdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more\nactive. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to\nthe top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment.\nWe are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the\nthread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT\nthread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something\nwe will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.\n\nParticl is on Mastodon\nDid you know of Mastodon? It is an open-source and decentralized social media\nplatform on which we have an account registered on. Make sure to give us a\nfollow for yet another way to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest news\nsurrounding the project by following the link here: \nhttps://mastodon.social/@particl\n\nWhat is Satoshi Citadel Industries?\nWe posted yesterday an interview with Miguel Cunetta, one of our key advisor,\nwhere he explains what is Satoshi Citadel Industries.

Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to use the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins that have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be part of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give any kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our development team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of security shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the Particl community.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-be-added-on-coinbase\">Will Particl be added on Coinbase?</h3><p>Imran, our Commercial &amp; Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for new exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones. There is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and are positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the “exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the marketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money where our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however, tell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly announce it.</p><p>We have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more professional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a solid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins.

It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of the more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you wait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.</em></p><h3 id=\"new-particl-desktop-developer-s-first-commit\">New Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-pPTQ44Cy-aSYxa4DOKe8yw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and oversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially working on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on August 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism. In fact, <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot\">zaSmilingIdiot</a> has a lot of experience working with large teams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our project and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113</a></p><p>It is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests, Github will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes and updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This can be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-tL7afRrDjl94gy4OKkl6nQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Pull Request Updates Indicator</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published-includes-new-exciting-developments\">New Status Report Published Includes New Exciting Developments</h3><p>Speaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status Report showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to fall into place!</p><h3 id=\"a-new-video-showing-the-impressive-amount-of-work-put-into-particl-since-its-inception\">A New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its Inception</h3><p>Today we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come out next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able to produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that our development team has put into Particl since its inception.</p><p>In this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with their names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names written in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development repositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are excluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and other repos instrumental to the development of the project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaaEG15n7zY?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are regardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping our codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts the project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core at all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting us all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments made over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as Particl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"the-pivx-particl-alliance-voting-round-is-an-overwhelming-success-\">The PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!</h3><p>We announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX community to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the Particl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace transactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get listed on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A majority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl Desktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!</p><h3 id=\"more-updates-being-made-to-the-website\">More Updates Being Made to the Website</h3><p>Our official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and updates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently revamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a wider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is <a href=\"https://particl.io/coin-specifications/\">Coin Specifications</a>, a page entirely dedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects of the Particl coin and blockchain.</p><p>To see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on Github here: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\">https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master</a></p><h3 id=\"forum-update\">Forum Update</h3><p>Almost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final email issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases, confirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either not reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which isn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.</p><p>If you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some feedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord and he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the registration email.</p><h3 id=\"bitcointalk-opening-post-being-revamped\">BitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped</h3><p>At the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are also working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely outdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT thread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something we will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.</p><h3 id=\"particl-is-on-mastodon\">Particl is on Mastodon</h3><p>Did you know of Mastodon?

Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to use the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins that have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be part of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give any kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our development team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of security shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the Particl community.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-be-added-on-coinbase\">Will Particl be added on Coinbase?</h3><p>Imran, our Commercial &#x26; Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for new exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones. There is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and are positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the “exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the marketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money where our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however, tell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly announce it.</p><p>We have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more professional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a solid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating any of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML identifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?</h3><p>It is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration) require KYC/AML identification of users <strong>on their end </strong>to be utilized to their full potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for the Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.</p><p>For clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to know our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess the interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX = 1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for people wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility usually associated with the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Rest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and will always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT capabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD escrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART coins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and is required for them to execute.</p><p>Stable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow users to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable means to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the Particl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give each other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience regular people are used to dealing with.</p><p>Note that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML identifications, but that will <strong>always</strong> we offered as an option and will <strong>never </strong>be mandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-team-aware-of-the-nothing-at-stake-attack-on-pos-consensus-algorithms-and-if-so-how-does-it-intend-to-fix-this-vulnerability\">Is the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and if so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?</h3><p>Yes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates vulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to mitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on Discord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about how we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack precisely.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-ringct-protocol-ready-for-mainnet-or-does-it-still-requires-some-tweaks-as-indicated-by-either-the-njit-department-of-technology-academic-report-or-wsa-s-security-audit\">Is the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks as indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or WSA’s security audit?</h3><p>Yes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue was found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many of you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we launched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for mainnet implementation.</p><p>Note that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the marketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for mainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users to be aware of it coming.</p><h3 id=\"is-ringct-on-marketplace-transactions-a-requirement-for-particl-marketplace-mainnet\">Is RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace mainnet?</h3><p>Most likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time as the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the marketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into Bulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce privacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.</p><p>The first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting to RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for the marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would release without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for a while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated about this as we know more.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-moin-why-are-they-looking-into-forking-the-particl-codebase-and-what-impact-would-that-carry-for-the-particl-project\">What is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what impact would that carry for the Particl project?</h3><p>MOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the Particl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &#x26; Branding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we did in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.</p><p>While we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did suggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it to Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both communities.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-better-than-its-competition\">What makes Particl better than its competition?</h3><p>Particl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact that we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from OpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as they are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized marketplace.</p><p>But the most important factors which makes us much different than <strong>any </strong>of our competitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization without compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace, it is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they employ moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form of escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to be hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it also leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow agent and one of the parties involved.</p><p>While it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party, it is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of the more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you wait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.</em></p><h3 id=\"new-particl-desktop-developer-s-first-commit\">New Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-pPTQ44Cy-aSYxa4DOKe8yw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and oversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially working on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on August 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism. In fact, <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot\">zaSmilingIdiot</a> has a lot of experience working with large teams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our project and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113</a></p><p>It is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests, Github will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes and updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This can be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-tL7afRrDjl94gy4OKkl6nQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Pull Request Updates Indicator</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published-includes-new-exciting-developments\">New Status Report Published Includes New Exciting Developments</h3><p>Speaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status Report showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to fall into place!</p><h3 id=\"a-new-video-showing-the-impressive-amount-of-work-put-into-particl-since-its-inception\">A New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its Inception</h3><p>Today we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come out next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able to produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that our development team has put into Particl since its inception.</p><p>In this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with their names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names written in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development repositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are excluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and other repos instrumental to the development of the project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaaEG15n7zY?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are regardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping our codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts the project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core at all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting us all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments made over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as Particl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"the-pivx-particl-alliance-voting-round-is-an-overwhelming-success-\">The PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!</h3><p>We announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX community to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the Particl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace transactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get listed on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client.

Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT thread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something we will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.</p><h3 id=\"particl-is-on-mastodon\">Particl is on Mastodon</h3><p>Did you know of Mastodon?

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to have prices displayed in their fiat value?\nWhile currently not available on Particl Marketplace Alpha, yes, this is\nsomething that ultimately would be part of Particl Marketplace. Paul speculated\nabout how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway\npoint is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a\nfeature that will, in the end, be enabled.\n\nWill there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to\ntheir product listing on the web?\nEverything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital\nfunction for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed.\nIn fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on\nthe public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a\ncustom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature\nwould also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.\n\nWe’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web\n& mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on\ndecentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce\nplatform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would\nmake the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).\n\nIs it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any\nspecific dates?\nThe two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are\nthe marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are\nalso heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on\ntestnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the\nRingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet\never since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT\nDepartment of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.\n\nWe can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are\ngoing to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the\nnext steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit\ntestnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet\nintegration alongside RingCT.\n\nThere are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that\ntimeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet\nrelease goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.\n\nAs always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be\nupdated soon.\n\nHave a notification system for vendors been put in place?\nAbsolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been\nintegrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.\n\nHas the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?\nYes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post\nintroducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like\nwe usually do.\n\nAny new Particl merchandise coming up?\nYes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types\nof merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a poll\non\nTwitter asking for your suggestions\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801].\n\nWe’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also\nusing our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest\nwith. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made\navailable!\n\nIs there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?\nYes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed\nwith PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that\nPART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right\ninto Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other\nout with some cross-promotion campaign.\n\nBoth teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace,\neffectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols\nin a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration\nwould, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this\nconcept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment,\nboth teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s\ndefinitely being kept in mind on both sides.\n\nThe proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving\nout details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!\n\nEDIT: For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still\nultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow\nsmart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Hardware Integration is Here!\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt\nMacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following\nthis link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is\ncurrently not available. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary\nsolution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop\nis completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop\nintegration will be given out in further updates.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\nParticl, Bitcoin & PIVX on the Ledger NanoAfter having submitted our own Ledger\n“third-party application\n[https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications]\n” to Ledger [https://www.ledger.com/] weeks ago, it has finally been officially\nintegrated into Ledger’s Nano S hardware devices\n[https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s] and Ledger Live\n[https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live]. That means you can now safely store\nyour PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the\nsecurity of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. This also makes Particl\nthe first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just\nsimply hardware staking.\n\n> As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden\nyour wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting\nhacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a\ncomputer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime\ntargets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected\ncomputers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.—\nParticl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]\nThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware\ndevice. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys\nare stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in\nplaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or\nmalicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\n— Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S [http://particl.wiki/ledger]\n\nFurthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security\nshouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as\nit relates to its governance (true democracy -> no voice left unheard). As such,\nthis Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not\nstraight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited\nto, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community\nas well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever\nrequiring to expose their private keys.\n\nThis announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey,\ndemonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain\nsolutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible\npackage that does not infringe on the user experience.\n\nDecentralized Project Governance\nWe also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project\ngovernance\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] that\nis nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with\nour legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it\ntoo restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.\n\nThe main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides\nin the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the\nsame time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds\nare stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to\nthe Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability\nand democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its\nfinal testing phase and to begin testnet integration.\n\nWe also announced in our Decentralized Project Governance update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] that\nthere were a total of ~33,800 PART\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm] \nleft in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate\nvoting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits\nmainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and\nideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.\n\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?\nFor those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a\nsurprise that Tecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert], our Core Developer &\nCryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on Particl Core 0.17.0.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha]. TV is\nknown for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge\nthe latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it.\nUsually, it takes a few weeks, sometimes even days after the release. But this\ntime, it seems like Tecnovert has been working overtime on 0.17, so it will be\ninteresting to see if he has anything special under the hood or if he’s just\nbeing extremely diligent.\n\nFor a rough 0.17 release timeline from Bitcoin Core, please visit this link: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624.\n\nNew Status Report\nWe released on the third of August a new Status Report on our website\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]. This report is quite similar to our \nprevious\nStatus Report [https://particl.news/new-status-report-released-8ca69930cfd] but\nalso contains some new, exciting information about the state of Particl\nMarketplace development. Indeed, the “Wrapped Up” section of the report shows\nthat a lot of items for the marketplace have been completed, including the\nProject Governance and Marketplace Governance tools. Some of the items marked as\n“Pending Review” have also been completed since we posted this report 7 days\nago, including the Ledger hardware integration\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae] and\nthe Particl Desktop 1.2.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2] (currently on\npre-release, mainnet).

Paul speculated about how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway point is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a feature that will, in the end, be enabled.</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-share-feature-where-vendors-will-be-able-to-send-a-link-to-their-product-listing-on-the-web\">Will there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to their product listing on the web?</h3><p>Everything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital function for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed. In fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on the public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a custom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature would also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.</p><p>We’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web &amp; mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on decentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce platform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would make the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).</p><h3 id=\"is-it-possible-to-have-the-order-at-which-releases-will-be-ready-without-any-specific-dates\">Is it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any specific dates?</h3><p>The two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are the marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are also heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on testnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the RingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet ever since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT Department of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.</p><p>We can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are going to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the next steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit testnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet integration alongside RingCT.</p><p>There are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that timeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet release goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.</p><p>As always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be updated soon.</p><h3 id=\"have-a-notification-system-for-vendors-been-put-in-place\">Have a notification system for vendors been put in place?</h3><p>Absolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been integrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.</p><h3 id=\"has-the-new-particl-desktop-developer-started-working-yet\">Has the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?</h3><p>Yes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post introducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like we usually do.</p><h3 id=\"any-new-particl-merchandise-coming-up\">Any new Particl merchandise coming up?</h3><p>Yes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types of merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801\">poll on Twitter asking for your suggestions</a>.</p><p>We’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also using our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest with. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made available!</p><h3 id=\"is-there-any-update-about-the-pivx-alliance-conference-call\">Is there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?</h3><p>Yes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed with PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that PART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right into Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other out with some cross-promotion campaign.</p><p>Both teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace, effectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols in a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration would, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this concept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment, both teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s definitely being kept in mind on both sides.</p><p>The proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving out details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still ultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow smart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-hardware-integration-is-here-\">Ledger Hardware Integration is Here!</h3><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt MacOS.

The Particl Ledger application currently only supports storing Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking, voting, transacting, etc).

That means you can now safely store your PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the security of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. <strong>This also makes Particl the first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just simply hardware staking</strong>.</p><blockquote>As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.<a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">— Particl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking</a><br>The <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger Nano S</a> is a hardware wallet, a special type of bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.<br>— <a href=\"http://particl.wiki/ledger\">Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S</a><br></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-T2j6SkK4e2E6aO1sSELHKw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Furthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security shouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as it relates to its governance (true democracy -&gt; no voice left unheard). As such, this Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not straight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited to, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community as well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever requiring to expose their private keys.</p><p>This announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey, demonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain solutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible package that does not infringe on the user experience.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-project-governance\">Decentralized Project Governance</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-PIFRczbnqdeXq5vQPKr4pg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">We also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project governance</a> that is nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with our legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it too restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.</p><p>The main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides in the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the same time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds are stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to the Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability and democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its final testing phase and to begin testnet integration.</p><p>We also announced in our <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Decentralized Project Governance update</a> that there were a total of ~<a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">33,800 PART</a> left in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate voting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits mainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and ideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-0-17-0-2-really-\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?</h3><p>For those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a surprise that <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\">Tecnovert</a>, our Core Developer &amp; Cryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2</a>. <em>TV </em>is known for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge the latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it.

As we are also heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on testnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the RingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet ever since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT Department of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.</p><p>We can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are going to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the next steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit testnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet integration alongside RingCT.</p><p>There are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that timeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet release goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.</p><p>As always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be updated soon.</p><h3 id=\"have-a-notification-system-for-vendors-been-put-in-place\">Have a notification system for vendors been put in place?</h3><p>Absolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been integrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.</p><h3 id=\"has-the-new-particl-desktop-developer-started-working-yet\">Has the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?</h3><p>Yes, his first day with us was on August 1st.

We have started looking into various types of merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801\">poll on Twitter asking for your suggestions</a>.</p><p>We’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also using our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest with. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made available!</p><h3 id=\"is-there-any-update-about-the-pivx-alliance-conference-call\">Is there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?</h3><p>Yes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed with PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that PART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right into Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other out with some cross-promotion campaign.</p><p>Both teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace, effectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols in a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration would, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this concept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment, both teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s definitely being kept in mind on both sides.</p><p>The proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving out details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still ultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow smart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-hardware-integration-is-here-\">Ledger Hardware Integration is Here!</h3><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt MacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following this link:</em><em><strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\"><em>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0</em></a></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is currently </em><em><strong>not available</strong></em><em>. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary solution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop is completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop integration will be given out in further updates.</em></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s Portfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports storing Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking, voting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a later time, this mostly depends on Ledger.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-ql_nYCy4FkvR35V2f9HolQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl, Bitcoin &#x26; PIVX on the Ledger Nano</figcaption></figure><p>After having submitted our own Ledger “<a href=\"https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications\">third-party application</a>” to <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger</a> weeks ago, it has finally been officially integrated into Ledger’s <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s\">Nano S hardware devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live\">Ledger Live</a>. That means you can now safely store your PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the security of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. <strong>This also makes Particl the first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just simply hardware staking</strong>.</p><blockquote>As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.<a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">— Particl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking</a><br>The <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger Nano S</a> is a hardware wallet, a special type of bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.<br>— <a href=\"http://particl.wiki/ledger\">Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S</a><br></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-T2j6SkK4e2E6aO1sSELHKw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Furthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security shouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as it relates to its governance (true democracy -> no voice left unheard). As such, this Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not straight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited to, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community as well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever requiring to expose their private keys.</p><p>This announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey, demonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain solutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible package that does not infringe on the user experience.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-project-governance\">Decentralized Project Governance</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-PIFRczbnqdeXq5vQPKr4pg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">We also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project governance</a> that is nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with our legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it too restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.</p><p>The main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides in the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the same time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds are stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to the Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability and democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its final testing phase and to begin testnet integration.</p><p>We also announced in our <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Decentralized Project Governance update</a> that there were a total of ~<a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">33,800 PART</a> left in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate voting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits mainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and ideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-0-17-0-2-really-\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?</h3><p>For those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a surprise that <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\">Tecnovert</a>, our Core Developer &#x26; Cryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2</a>. <em>TV </em>is known for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge the latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it. Usually, it takes a few weeks, sometimes even days after the release. But this time, it seems like Tecnovert has been working overtime on 0.17, so it will be interesting to see if he has anything special under the hood or if he’s just being extremely diligent.</p><p>For a rough 0.17 release timeline from Bitcoin Core, please visit this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-lB2nJnMgGZApAI1E8Ueweg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">We released on the third of August a new Status Report on our website</a>. This report is quite similar to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-status-report-released-8ca69930cfd\">previous Status Report</a> but also contains some new, exciting information about the state of Particl Marketplace development. Indeed, the “Wrapped Up” section of the report shows that a lot of items for the marketplace have been completed, including the Project Governance and Marketplace Governance tools. Some of the items marked as “Pending Review” have also been completed since we posted this report 7 days ago, including the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">Ledger hardware integration</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> (currently on pre-release, mainnet). A new Status Report should be posted soon and we will post an update here on <a href=\"http://particl.news\">particl.news</a>.</p><h3 id=\"development-is-at-an-all-time-high-\">Development is at an All-Time High!</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-5gzxYR-2F14bUso6Oer9tQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Jira</figcaption></figure><p>The development process of the Particl project has never been in such good shape. Indeed, the project has reached a stage where our team has gained a lot of experience and have adapted their work methods to better organize and deliver more efficiently. That much can be seen on our Github with as much as 3 to 6 repositories being updated daily and by how fast items in our Status Report are getting hammered.</p><p>A lot of this can be attributed to our two new managers, Carmen and Vivienne, as well as the new<a href=\"https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/\"> Agile methodologies</a> and strategies the team has established during its last meeting in Prague. It is worth noting that Github is <strong>only the tip of the iceberg</strong>, most of the development process and communications happening internally using <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\"><strong>Jira</strong></a>.</p><p>As we are seeing a lot of items being marked as completed and as we keep hiring new developers such as our new Particl Desktop developer or any developer we will be hiring after the primary funding round, the Particl project is slowly entering into a new phase. We will soon reach a point where a lot of the pieces will start falling into place in a relatively short period of time while the development pace keeps increasing. Furthermore, the future release of our developer SDK should also attract many more “outside” developers contributing themselves to the accelerating development pace of the project. Simply put, we believe our best days are ahead of us and at arm’s length.</p><p><strong>Teaser: </strong>We will post next week a video demonstrating the impressive work our developers have put into Particl since we embarked on this journey a little more than a year ago. This demonstration will be in the form of a Github contribution timeline and will help understand several factors associated with the development of an open-source project.

Turns out this entrepreneur has big plans for Particl!</p><p>With the desire to integrate Particl onto its decentralized marketplace gateway platform, Mubiz will undoubtedly become an enormous piece of the puzzle for Particl to go mainstream by offering a modern and responsive web &#x26; mobile interface (currently under FULL revamping) and by taking care of all the techy/geeky stuff like MAD escrow, crypto payments, customer support, and returns. Yes, you read that right!</p><p><strong>Stay tuned for this exclusive, ground-breaking interview where Albin will lay down his vision for Particl and decentralized marketplaces in general and explain exactly how he intends to make all the cryptocurrency and blockchain processes operate in the background, leaving users with a user-experience no different than any other web-based marketplace.

You can visit the website right now and already see that we have started merging some changes to it, currently mainly being focused on the header (more dynamic, more engaging).

Update\n[https://particl.news/community-update-3-407404771f11], the Particl team has\nbegun working on the initial version of the project governance mechanism\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087]. Simply put, this\nmechanism allows anyone to be able to vote or submit up for a vote a formal\nproposal to the Particl community.\n\nNote: The initial version of the governance system will not contain all the\nfeatures and functionalities that are planned for later versions (i.e. voting\nweight). It will, however, be its first “working version” and will contain most\n(or all) of the basic functionalities. The governance mechanisms will, of\ncourse, be a moving target for some time as we experiment with it in real-life\nscenarios.\n\nHow Does it Work?\nCommunity Proposal ScreenAs many of you already know, Particl has had a fully\ndecentralized voting system on our mainnet ever since it launched in July 2017.\nThis feature, however, has always only been available on CLI (non-graphical\nParticl wallet) and is relatively restrictive in nature. For example, using the\n“legacy” voting system of Particl, it was not possible to vote on two proposals\nat the same time. This behavior not being the most scalable for a truly useful\ndecentralized governance system, the team has been actively working on improving\nthis voting mechanism to give it more flexibility and accessibility.\n\nThe first improvement was to implement it into Particl Desktop, the main wallet\nfor the Particl network. Because Particl-cli isn’t really used by most people\noutside of staking — and more importantly, because users are more likely to use\na simple, well-designed interface to provide them a voice on the network — it\nwas really important to port this feature over our main client.\n\nDecentralized Voting ScreenOnce implemented, it will be possible to go through\nthe entire proposal process directly from Particl Desktop. Indeed, users will be\nable to both create a proposal from scratch and submit it to the community for a\nvoting round. Any Particl user will then be able to navigate to their voting\nscreen and vote on any ongoing proposal. To vote, users do not need to be\nstaking anymore, and weight will ultimately be based on coin weight rather than\nstaking weight. This decision has been made in order to increase the governance\ntool’s accessibility and speed at which consensuses can be reached.\n\nIn fact, users that own fewer amounts of coins are less likely to put up their\ncoins for staking, yet they ideally still need to have a way to express their\nvoice so that the governance system can truly be considered democratic and\ndecentralized. There are many other reasons users would not want to put their\ncoins up for staking, yet when the project governance tool releases on mainnet,\nthey will still be able to partake in the project’s decentralized governance\nprocess they have a stake in.\n\nTallying the number of coins instead of the staking weights is also a much more\naccurate and quick measurement. Indeed, Proof-of-Stake relies partly on luck,\nsimilarly to PoW mining, which is democratically not ideal for obvious reasons;\naccurate results are more interesting than results partly defined by luck. This\nnew governance system mostly requires users to sign a message proving they own\nthe number of coins that they do and that they are voting from their outputs.\nDon’t worry, this all happens automatically under the hood while the entire\ngovernance process is displayed in a user-friendly fashion on Particl Desktop.\nTallying coins instead of staking weights also allows the mechanism to find\nconsensuses more rapidly in certain situations, a feat that is definitely useful\nas that same mechanism is also the basis for the marketplace governance system\nwhere undesirable content needs to be taken out as quickly as possible.\n\nVotes are tallied every time a user votes, which means that as you move your\ncoins around, so do your votes as well. It is thus possible to easily change\nyour vote if you move your coins before a voting round completes.\n\nCold Voting\nThe project governance mechanism is also built with hardware compatibility in\nmind. In fact, as stated in yesterday’s announcement of the integration of\nParticl on the Ledger Nano S\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae],\nusers will eventually be able to “cold vote” using their Ledger Nano S hardware\ndevice directly from the Particl Desktop client. This is probably not a feature\nthat will be available out of the box once the project governance system hits\nmainnet as it still requires a bit of work on our end, but it will ultimately be\navailable at some point in the future. This is directly related to our\ncommitment to develop and make available the most secure blockchain solutions in\nthe industry. To understand the significance of cold voting vs regular,\nespecially as it relates to security, read our Hardware Cold Staking\nannouncement here\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\n\nCommunity Initiative Fund\nBack when Particl users were asked to generate their keys and prepare for the\nParticl genesis block, an initiative has been proposed by the community to\ncompensate SDC coin holders who had failed to swap their coins within the given\nswap timeframe. As such, the community donated an impressive amount of over \n156,000 PART\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm] \nto be paid to the late swappers. Since the clemency period was set up to last\nup\nuntil the last day of 2017\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it wasn’t\npossible at the time to know how many late swappers would claim their PART\ncoins, thus making the donation target a blind one. For this reason, Particl\nusers ended up donating an excess amount of coins to the Community Initiative\nFund. This address contains, without any late swapping claims being accepted\nanymore, a final total amount of 33,817.64 PART.\n\nThe Community in Control\nThe Community Initiative Fund is a donation address owned by the Particl\ncommunity itself. In fact, since its funds originate from community donations,\nneither the Particl Foundation nor the Particl team can move them around without\nany form of community consensus first.\n\nTo facilitate debates around proposed solutions, ideas, and proposals made on\nhow to best use these funds, we’ve announced\n[https://particl.news/building-a-framework-for-community-contribution-e056c04c9c09] \nand created back in January a Kialo discussion thread\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e].\nKialo is a good debate platform where users can form arguments and\ncounter-arguments in a structured and easy-to-follow fashion.\n\nAs we are nearing the testnet and mainnet implementations of the project\ngovernance system on Particl Desktop, there has never been a better time to put\ndown on paper and on Kialo any proposal idea you have been thinking about. The\nbest way to get your proposal accepted by the community is to create excitement\nleading up to the voting round, therefore initiating discussions around your\nproject early on could end up helping your proposal being voted in favor of. If\nyou submit any idea on Kialo, make sure to post about it on our Discord server\nor in the coming Particl forum so that people can know and discuss it.\n\nAs the decentralized project governance system still requires a bit of work and\nof course, testing, there is still some time left to prepare your proposals\nuntil we hold official voting rounds related to the Community Initiative Fund.\nMore details about these rounds will be included in a next Decentralized Project\nGovernance Update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon’t forget that you can track most of the development process by following us\non Github [https://github.com/particl].

Simply head over to this link and follow the\ninstructions: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking. Note that, while the process\ncan currently only be executed from the Particl-Qt client, an actual Particl\nDesktop integration will be coming at a later time.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are very excited to finally announce that as of today, Ledger has officially\nadded support for Particl on their Ledger Live application and Nano S device.\nThis means PART will now be available for cold storage on Nano S hardware\nwallets with cold staking capabilities enabled. This release marks the first\ntime pure PoS coins stored on a hardware device can be safely staked without any\nintermediary nor internet connection required.\n\nTo learn how to use Particl on the Ledger Nano S, follow this simple tutorial on\nour Wiki page: https://particl.wiki/ledger\n\nThe Most Secure Way to Store PART\nNo matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are,\nyou are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you\neither enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device.\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and\ncyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in\nthe total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.\n\nThe Ledged Nano S hardware deviceThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure\nhardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets:\nprivate keys are stored in a protected area of a micro-controller, and cannot be\ntransferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even\nwhen connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\n\nThe World’s Most Secure PoS Protocol\nA vulnerability often associated with PoS is the risk associated with the\nprocess of staking itself. In fact, Proof-of-Stake protocols usually require\nusers to keep their wallets online and “unlocked for staking”. While wallets in\nthat state are still locked and require a password to execute transactions, this\nvery password is stored in the device’s memory so that it can remain “unlocked\nfor staking”. As we’ve seen with the Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this\nyear\n[https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870]\n, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily\nresult in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.\n\nThis issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold\nstaking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which\ncontain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address,\neven coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets.\nThese staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than\nthe end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what\nthis means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake\nexposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility\nis assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be\nleft unencrypted).\n\nThe Ultimate Vulnerability\nHowever, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl\nstakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected\ncomputers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone\ndoes not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter\nhow secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to\neither spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means\nprivate keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for\na brief moment. With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for\nhackers and cyber thieves\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU]\n, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being\naware of it becomes greater. That is even more true as more and more\nvulnerabilities and exploits surrounding the ME Intel chip keep making headlines\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-me-new-firmware-bugs,37492.html].\n\n> Between all the new Spectre-class CPU flaws and the bugs the company and other\nresearchers keep finding for its Management Engine (ME) firmware, Intel can’t\nseem to catch a break. Now the company has publicly disclosed two more ME bugs,\none of which allows remote code execution on victims’ PCs.\nThe ME Intel chip\n[https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html] is a\nproprietary engine that powers hardware features that operate at the baseboard\nlevel, below the operating system. By enabling interaction with low-level\nhardware, this chip gives administrators (or any user that can find practical\nexploits) the ability to perform tasks that previously required someone to be\nphysically present at the desktop. The EFF itself describes the ME Intel chip\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it] \nas a “largely undocumented master controller for your CPU: it works with system\nfirmware during boot and has direct access to system memory, the screen,\nkeyboard, and network”.\n\nSimply put, transacting any coin, PoS or PoW, is something that is exponentially\nbecoming riskier as hackers get more experience in the crypto industry and\nimprove their techniques.\n\nHardware Cold Staking to the Rescue\nSecure Staking Brings Peace of MindThis is where the significance of this Ledger\nNano S integration comes into play as it is coded in such a way that no private\nkey needs to be exchanged between the Ledger Nano S hardware device and the\nclient (Particl-Qt). This means that users will now be able to store funds\nstored on a hardware device and still delegate the hardware wallet’s staking\npowers to a cold staking node.\n\nThis release, as it currently stands, is the first ever successful mainnet\nrelease of a pure PoS hardware cold staking setup, the ultimate solution for\nusers looking at getting the best level of security, flexibility, and\naccessibility without compromising decentralization. You know, when they say you \n“can’t have your cake and it eat too”, well it turns out with Particl you now\ncan!\n\nSecure Decentralized Voting Process\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThis Ledger Nano S integration currently only\nallow users to securely store and stake their funds offline on a hardware\ndevice, but it will also ultimately let users participate in both governance\nmechanisms available on Particl. Indeed, with a bit of additional work, users\nwill be able to use their coins stored on their hardware device to participate\nin both governance system without ever requiring to expose their private key or\npassword on the computer used to register their vote. This ensures that ALL\nParticl users, even those with the highest security standards, can partake in\nthe decentralized governance of the project and its platform. No voice left\nunheard!\n\nExciting Times Lie Ahead\nThis release marks the start of an exciting period for the Particl project as we\nwill start seeing more and more features hit both the testnet and mainnet\nnetworks. After a year or so of being in a deep development phase, the pieces\nare finally starting to come all together leading up to the release of the\nlong-awaited Particl Marketplace on mainnet.\n\nAs a matter of fact, ever since the team meeting in Prague, the team has adopted\nnew, better development and management processes and methodologies and has never\nbeen as effective as it currently is.

Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Introduces-Hardware-Cold-Staking/1-o-lz1vGSH1_ABPtV3Bc8zQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>The Ledged Nano S hardware device</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger Nano S</a> is a hardware wallet, a special type of cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a protected area of a micro-controller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-secure-pos-protocol\">The World’s Most Secure PoS Protocol</h3><p>A vulnerability often associated with PoS is the risk associated with the process of staking itself. In fact, Proof-of-Stake protocols usually require users to keep their wallets online and “unlocked for staking”. While wallets in that state are still locked and require a password to execute transactions, this very password is stored in the device’s memory so that it can remain “unlocked for staking”. As we’ve seen with the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870\">Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this year</a>, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily result in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.</p><p>This issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold staking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which contain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address, even coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets. These staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than the end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what this means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake exposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility is assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be left unencrypted).</p><h3 id=\"the-ultimate-vulnerability\">The Ultimate Vulnerability</h3><p>However, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl stakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected computers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone does not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter how secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to either spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means private keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for a brief moment. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU\">With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for hackers and cyber thieves</a>, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being aware of it becomes greater. That is even more true as <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-me-new-firmware-bugs,37492.html\">more and more vulnerabilities and exploits surrounding the ME Intel chip keep making headlines</a>.</p><blockquote>Between all the new Spectre-class CPU flaws and the bugs the company and other researchers keep finding for its Management Engine (ME) firmware, Intel can’t seem to catch a break.

This new report\ncontains a lot of information about the status of the project’s development as\nwell as a pretty good presentation of the features that are most likely to be\nincluded in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace.\n\nWhat We Are Busy With\nThis section of the report shows what the Particl development team is already\nworking on. These items are currently under active development and are the\nprimary short-term focus points of our developers.\n\nMarketplace\nAs many of you already know, the team is currently heavily focused on developing\nand putting together both the project and marketplace governance systems.\n\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThe project governance system\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] will allow users to\ncreate and submit proposals for the community to vote on. These proposals will\nbe extremely useful to reach consensus within the community in a provably fair\nfashion. This proposal system is required for the community to vote on what to\ndo with the remaining funds in the Community Initiative Fund\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e] \n(~33,000 PART, 100% community-owned).\n\nThe marketplace governance system, on the other hand, is the function that\nallows users to flag undesirable content on Particl Marketplace. As no party\nother than the community itself has moderation powers over the marketplace, this\nfeature is considered an absolute requirement for the marketplace DApp to be\nreleased on mainnet. Indeed, this mechanism gives community moderation powers\nover the content posted on it so that it can stay clean and free of\nreprehensible or spammy content.\n\nAside from both governance systems, there is also quite a few improvements being\nmade to the marketplace based on the various feedback we’ve received from all of\nthe people who have tested the Alpha version. This includes the refactoring of\nseveral aspects of the code, making it much smoother, faster, and intuitive to\nuse, and a few new feature enhancements such as advanced filtering options and\nexpiry time on listed products.\n\nA few items here are actually quite interesting. In fact, the team is currently\nworking on a new hardware wallet integration, Trezor, to give users more options\nwhen it comes to secure storage of funds.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nA major and long-awaited Particl Desktop feature has also started being worked\non [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], namely multi-wallets.\nThis function enables the possibility to set up several different wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is a great feature for both security,\nprivacy, and usability.\n\nTwo Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop InstanceMulti-wallets\nallow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of\nmismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen\nas different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each\nwallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace\nprofiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there\nis no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them,\nthe previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other\nwallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type\nof data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same\nParticl Desktop instance.\n\nThis feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles\nor accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing\nmarketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process.\nUsers can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one\nof them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.\n\nIndeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet,\neven if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each\nstaking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a\ndifferent address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per\nwallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by\nredirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they\nwant (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the\nother 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop\nprojects on the Particl network).\n\nTrezor Integration\nTrezor Hardware WalletWe’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration,\nbut we’re not stopping there. With the goal of providing our users with more\nflexibility by making more options available, we can announce that we have\nstarted working on an integration to the Trezor hardware wallet\n[https://trezor.io/]!\n\n> Trezor is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin\ntransactions. With Trezor, transactions are completely safe even when initiated\non a compromised or vulnerable computer. Because the use of Trezor is very easy\nand intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption among people not familiar\nwith the security issues. —https://wiki.trezor.io/FAQ:Overview\nWaiting for Review\nA few items have been completed and are awaiting the final review before being\nintegrated. Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for\nReview”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade,\nhave been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet\npre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated\nsoon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal\nscreen and notification system for order status changes.\n\nWhat’s on the Horizon — Beta\nThis section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items\nfor the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what\nthe Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the\ndevelopment team will be working in the short to mid-term.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nAs pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are\ngoing to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.\n\nStarting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace\nThis simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode\nonly when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl\nDesktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re\nlaunching it from (~400mb less memory required).\n\nPrivate Markets & Listings\nPrivate markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These\nmarkets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of\nParticl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link\n(usually provided by the market creator).\n\nPrivate listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like\nprivate markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market\nunless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings\nintend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you\nwere to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.\n\nWhile these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they\nare deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed\nwith a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold\nin order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing\nwould be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very\npopular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.\n\nEscrow Enhancements & Deposit Negotiations\nThe decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl\nMarketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the\nvery obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration\nof the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by\nthe NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm.\nOther enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its\nstability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and\nmore.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nAnother needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client\nis a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well\nas various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an\never-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more\noptions as the Particl platform grows.\n\nParticl Software Development Kit\nAnother long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development\ntoolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized\napplications, widgets, and features on the Particl network.

This function enables the possibility to set up several different wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance. This is a great feature for both security, privacy, and usability.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-Qo-jqiEtrW8sAEbyAJNGCg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Two Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop Instance</figcaption></figure><p>Multi-wallets allow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of mismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen as different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each wallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace profiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there is no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them, the previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other wallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type of data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same Particl Desktop instance.</p><p>This feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles or accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing marketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process. Users can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one of them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.</p><p>Indeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet, even if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each staking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a different address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per wallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by redirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they want (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the other 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop projects on the Particl network).</p><h3 id=\"trezor-integration\">Trezor Integration</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-VhiG1xJJr_vYYsJczTCLyw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Trezor Hardware Wallet</figcaption></figure><p>We’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration, but we’re not stopping there.

These private listings intend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you were to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.</p><p>While these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they are deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed with a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold in order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing would be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very popular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.</p><h3 id=\"escrow-enhancements-deposit-negotiations\">Escrow Enhancements &amp; Deposit Negotiations</h3><p>The decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl Marketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the very obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration of the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm. Other enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its stability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and more.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>Another needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client is a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well as various Particl Desktop wide features.

In other words, there is no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them, the previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other wallet.

That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by redirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they want (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the other 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop projects on the Particl network)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"trezor-integration"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Trezor Integration"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-card-hascaption"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-VhiG1xJJr_vYYsJczTCLyw.png","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tagName":"figcaption","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Trezor Hardware Wallet"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration, but we’re not stopping there.

Most\nimportantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and\nuser-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our\nmainnet Particl Marketplace.\n\nWe strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are\nabsolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to\ncreating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics\nalso go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building\nan online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.\n\nFor a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social\nmedia coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME]\n\nIs there any update about exchanges listing?\n\nWe are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to\nget the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very\nimportant, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl\nMarketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother\nand more seamless the experience will be.\n\nWe’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due\nto our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges,\nrather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive\nwith securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to\nexchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence\nand working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange\nfrom adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.\n\nWhat would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?\n\nDarpal Rating’s June Github Audit ReportWhile a more valuable PART coin allows\nus to do more, the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the\nPART coin. In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year,\nand may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.\n\nThe Particl Foundation website [https://particl.foundation] is the best resource\nfor most questions surrounding financials.\n\nNo matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work\nwe put into developing the Particl project.\n\nIndeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest\nvalue, Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/@DPRating], a rating agency conducting\na monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, \nranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and\nprivacy coins\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the\ndevelopment process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.\n\nThese consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120] only confirms the\nrelentlessness of the development force behind Particl.\n\nWe are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This\nfunding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take\nParticl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and\ninvest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of\nParticl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups\nusually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then\nraising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.\n\nThe primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it\nwill signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one\nwhere marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will\nbe more prevalent than they currently are.\n\nAny update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?\n\nThere is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger\nintegration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger\nso that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We\nencourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to\nintegrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing\norganic community support.\n\nNote that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is\nrecommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with\npublic transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.\n\nThere is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware\nintegration: Trezor.\n\nIs the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?\n\nWe are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not\nproduction-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time.\nWhat we’re looking into, however, is the new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj\n[https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1] that would\nallow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing\nfeasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to\ngenerate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic\nrouting protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.\n\nIs it looking at Bulletproofs?\nAs for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are\nsomething we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the\nproper research & development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain\nhasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan,\nhowever, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of\nBulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy\ntransactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of\npriorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that\nprotocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.\n\nFor more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper\nhere: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n\nAny plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?\n\nYes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything\nelse, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the\nmarketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and\nhardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop\nversion).\n\nWe also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The\nentire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the\ncommunity. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also\npossible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be\nadded to it.\n\nWill there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in\nParticl Desktop such as the marketplace?\n\nYes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is\ndone with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially\nthose in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones\ninstead. For these reasons, we strongly believe we absolutely need a mobile\nversion for the marketplace and will put the resources in place for this further\ndown the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on\nthe multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a secure \ndecentralized web interface and mobile application possible.\n\nAs we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set\nup a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this\nmobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary\nround where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest\nassured, we know we need this and will make it happen!\n\nSuch a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when\nwe said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.\n\nWhen will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?\n\nParticl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis\nblock but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the\nmessaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to\ncommunicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The\nteam is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently\nnot in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.\n\nWill there be a marketing push for RingCT?\n\nYes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based\nhardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release\nsimilarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy\nprotocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other\ncodebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be\nproperly advertised as such.\n\nWhat’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?\n\nIntegrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re\ncurrently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a\nhardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation\nfor it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance\nsystem also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource\nefficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the\nlikely strategy the team will pursue.\n\nWith that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation\nmay be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can\nbe included at the same time as the governance system.\n\nDo you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?\n\nWeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting,\nauditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code\naudit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl\nfor the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10\ncustom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that\nno major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only\nsome minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to\nreceive the fully detailed report.\n\nGraphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in\nthe Particl protocolAre Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?\n\nYes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing\nour private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress\nwhich will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system\nis going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that\nultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first\npost-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet\nexclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes\nonly.\n\nWhen will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?\n\nThe report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website. Keep an eye\nout here: http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates & Tidbits\nPaul also had a few comments and information for the community not covered by\nthe questions asked by the community.\n\nGithub\nOne of the best ways to keep updated with the development side of the Particl\nproject is to go to the source. In fact, our Github page contains a lot of\ninformation and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting\nway to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of\nour repositories.\n\nFor example, the Particl Desktop pull request tab\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls] shows a few interesting pull\nrequests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find\ninformation about multi-wallets\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], project governance\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] (community proposals), \nand more\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed].\n\nNew Status Report Published\nFor those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with\nthe Particl development news, the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/] on our website (particl.io) is the perfect\npoint of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about\nwhat is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well\nas what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!\n\nStatus ReportProject Governance (Community Proposals)\nAs you can see in both the GIF above and in the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/], we’re currently actively working on putting\ntogether the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their\nown proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not\nrepresent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they\nwere voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand,\nare proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of\nproposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be\nadopted and acted upon.\n\nFor more screenshots of the project governance user interface, click here\n[https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q], and for more information about the development of\nthis Particl Desktop feature, click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087].\n\nCommunity Fund\nIn light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there\nhas never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our\nKialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of\naround 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community,\nnot the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held\non the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the\ncommunity to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on\nParticl Desktop by creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME].\n\nFirst Anniversary\nWe celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary! In fact, Particl’s\ngenesis block was staked on the 17th of Jul 17, 2017, at 9:00:00 AM\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c]\n, and we took the opportunity to thank our supporters and recap on the progress\nmade in just a short year\n[https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95]. The best is yet\nto come!\n\nNJIT’s Academic Paper\nWe currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and\nwork on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them\nthe green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within\nacademic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime\nbefore we make it public on ours.\n\nParticl in Johannesburg\nMembers of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in\nJohannesburg, South Africa. The conference is a one-day event with a focus on\nBlockchain Technology and is in part sponsored by the Particl Foundation. Stop\nby the Particl booth to talk with team members and get Particl swag!\n\nFor more information about the schedule and to get tickets, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-on-location-at-johannesburg-blockchain-conference-july-27th-2018-7e19fa083b08\n\nDiscord\nWe will gradually be moving to Discord officially, which means it will become\nthe preferred or “default” chat platform for most of the team and chat support.\nWe will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord\ncan still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms\nwill not be focused on as much as before.\n\nWe believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its\nflexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse\nforum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience\nwith bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.\n\nMusic Channel\nOne cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music\nchannel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music\nthat anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on\nDiscord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite\nmusic with other Particl community members!\n\nParticl on Discourse\nWe are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it\nup. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it\nshould probably be resolved for next week.\n\nDemonstration of the coming Particl forumLaunching the forum will change a few\nthings around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the\nPartaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found\na few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate\nwithdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform\nwhich we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking\ninto potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We\nwill keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding\neverything forum related.\n\nOne other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be\nfor vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference\nto get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a\nproduct (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We\nstrongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow\nand the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone\nto dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.\n\nNew Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace\nWe will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl\nMarketplace. One of these goodies we want to make available are the pins\ngenerously offered to us by ICOsensei. Keep an eye out for any announcement\nregarding marketplace giveaways!\n\n—\n\nCryptoRamble Videos Since Last Community Update\n * Beginner’s Guide to Cryptocurrency 2018\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHmzVvloFFo]\n * Particl Development Update [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6IHDNw0BTQ]\n * Immigrant Data is Being Sold to ICE (WUWP#3)\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRJINSRmHSE]","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-aEYJjiffXVsGW_UnHl0LlA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Did you miss our last AMA/FAQ livestream on Youtube?

For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the Partaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found a few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate withdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform which we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking into potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We will keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding everything forum related.</p><p>One other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be for vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference to get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a product (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We strongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow and the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone to dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.</p><h3 id=\"new-merch-available-for-free-on-particl-marketplace\">New Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace</h3><p>We will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl Marketplace.

Note that some of these answers have been updated with the most recent news and developments that happened since the livestream.</p><p><strong>When can a new Particl Desktop be expected?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-HvxF1evJHXiJqO-NkfSxwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Cold staking widget is back!</figcaption></figure><p>A new update (1.2.2) for Particl Desktop is almost ready and should be released any day from now. Currently at the pre-release stage, it is going to be a big release with several bug fixes (i.e. cold staking widget), stability improvements as well as a lot of new additions. Most importantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and user-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace.</p><p>We strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are absolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to creating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics also go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building an online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">For a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social media coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.</a></p><p><strong>Is there any update about exchanges listing?</strong></p><p>We are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to get the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very important, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother and more seamless the experience will be.</p><p>We’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due to our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges, rather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive with securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to exchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence and working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange from adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.</p><p><strong>What would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-DMZNvDVsJwSGgpj57S2nqg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Darpal Rating’s June Github Audit Report</figcaption></figure><p>While a more valuable PART coin allows us to do more, <strong>the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the PART coin.</strong> In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year, and may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.</p><p>The Particl Foundation <a href=\"https://particl.foundation\">website</a> is the best resource for most questions surrounding financials.</p><p><strong>No matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work we put into developing the Particl project.</strong></p><p>Indeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest value, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\">Darpal Rating</a>, a rating agency conducting a monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, <a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\">ranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and privacy coins</a>. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the development process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.</p><p>These <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120\">consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating</a> only confirms the relentlessness of the development force behind Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>We are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This funding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take Particl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and invest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of Particl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups usually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then raising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.</p><p>The primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it will signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one where marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will be more prevalent than they currently are.</p><p><strong>Any update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?</strong></p><p>There is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger integration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger so that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We encourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to integrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing organic community support.</p><p>Note that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is recommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with public transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.</p><p>There is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware integration: Trezor.</p><p><strong>Is the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?</strong></p><p>We are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not production-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time. What we’re looking into, however, is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1\">new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj</a> that would allow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing feasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to generate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic routing protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.</p><h3 id=\"is-it-looking-at-bulletproofs\">Is it looking at Bulletproofs?</h3><p>As for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are something we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the proper research &#x26; development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain hasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan, however, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of Bulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy transactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of priorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that protocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.</p><p>For more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper here: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Any plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything else, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the marketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and hardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop version).</p><p>We also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The entire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the community. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also possible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be added to it.</p><p><strong>Will there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in Particl Desktop such as the marketplace?</strong></p><p>Yes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is done with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially those in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones instead. For these reasons, we strongly believe <strong>we absolutely need a mobile version for the marketplace</strong> and will put the resources in place for this further down the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on the multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a <strong>secure </strong>decentralized web interface and mobile application possible.</p><p>As we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set up a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this mobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary round where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest assured, we know we need this and will make it happen!</p><p>Such a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when we said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.</p><p><strong>When will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?</strong></p><p>Particl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis block but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the messaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The team is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently not in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.</p><p><strong>Will there be a marketing push for RingCT?</strong></p><p>Yes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based hardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release similarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy protocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be properly advertised as such.</p><p><strong>What’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?</strong></p><p>Integrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re currently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a hardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation for it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance system also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource efficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the likely strategy the team will pursue.</p><p>With that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation may be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can be included at the same time as the governance system.</p><p><strong>Do you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?</strong></p><p>WeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting, auditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code audit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl for the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10 custom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that no major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only some minor issues have been identified and are being addressed!

Its flexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse forum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience with bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.</p><h3 id=\"music-channel\">Music Channel</h3><p>One cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music channel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music that anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on Discord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite music with other Particl community members!</p><h3 id=\"particl-on-discourse\">Particl on Discourse</h3><p>We are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it up. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it should probably be resolved for next week.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-cBKLFANfZQHq8Ij8yMgDTg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Demonstration of the coming Particl forum</figcaption></figure><p>Launching the forum will change a few things around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the Partaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found a few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate withdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform which we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking into potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We will keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding everything forum related.</p><p>One other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be for vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference to get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a product (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We strongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow and the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone to dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.</p><h3 id=\"new-merch-available-for-free-on-particl-marketplace\">New Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace</h3><p>We will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl Marketplace. One of these goodies we want to make available are the pins generously offered to us by ICOsensei. Keep an eye out for any announcement regarding marketplace giveaways!</p><p>—</p><h3 id=\"cryptoramble-videos-since-last-community-update\">CryptoRamble Videos Since Last Community Update</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHmzVvloFFo\">Beginner’s Guide to Cryptocurrency 2018</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6IHDNw0BTQ\">Particl Development Update</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRJINSRmHSE\">Immigrant Data is Being Sold to ICE (WUWP#3)</a></li></ul>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-aEYJjiffXVsGW_UnHl0LlA.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Did you miss our last AMA/FAQ livestream on Youtube?

Nakamoto and their “magic internet money”?\n\n| btw, Particl mentioned in there ;)That naivety to understanding technology is\na double-edged sword in the decentralized ecosystem because fancy marketing and\n30 minutes spent writing an ERC20 contract can generate a lot of buzz (and\nmoney) around magical solutions to everyday problems.\n\nThe question becomes, when does the tech make sense and when doesn’t it?\n\nEnable Privacy\nSetting out to create a platform for privacy-focused decentralized applications\nis not a challenge for the faint of heart. In fact, among the thousands of\ncryptocurrency projects in existence, Particl is still one of the only\nopen-source platform being developed with privacy in its DNA.\n\nPrivacy is a well-discussed topic in blockchain solutions but 99% of the time it\nis merely an afterthought or even by product when building on a decentralized\nnetwork. Particl is private by design which makes everything our team develops\nmultiple times harder to achieve and is why no other project is comparable when\nlooking at the full breadth of products and features Particl already offers\nafter 1 year.\n\nWhenever shareholders are involved and need to be kept happy, privacy becomes a\nmarketing buzz word that is attached to data collection tools in fancy ways like \n“Personal Recommendations”, “Shoppers Also Liked”, “Your friends are talking\nabout…”, “You parked here…”.\n\nUser data is a powerful metric all companies use to their advantage in order to\nmaximize profits. A good marketing team will package it within a “privacy”\nwrapper to make users feel safe and cozy like warm alpaca socks, while the\npersonal information people willingly provide helps giant internet companies\nbuild better tools to appease shareholders and make the most money possible.\n\nThere is a case for privacy-focused decentralized applications in the tech\nindustry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nand, at one year young, Particl is one of the only project building an\nopen-source privacy platform that is truly private by design.\n\nOrigination & Innovation\nParticl Core [https://github.com/particl/particl-core] is the backbone of the\nproject and is the source for a number of privacy enhancements to the underlying\nBitcoin codebase this past year. All revolve around privacy and security and are\nindustry pioneering innovations:\n\n * Confidential Transactions (CT)\n * Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)\n * Particl Proof of Stake (PPoS) with Cold Staking\n * Secure Message (SMSG)\n\nParticl Core has averaged a new release every 3 weeks (20 releases) this year. A\nvery impressive development pace, wouldn’t you agree? And these aren’t trivial\ncode commits; many are industry firsts as you can see by the list above.\n\nMuch of this credit goes to our Lead Core Developer, Tecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert], and his team. Besides researching and\nimplementing intense cryptographic standards into Particl, they are also staying\ncurrent with Bitcoin Core development.\n\nBitcoin developers have updated Bitcoin’s codebase 5\n[https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history]* times since the launch of Particl\n(0.14.2). Our team merged those changes every time, after a proper testing\nperiod had passed and the code was ready for Particl mainnet.\n\n> Bitcoin code commits alone (nearly 5000) account for 1,185 changed files with \n124,688 additions and 56,438 deletions.\n * Bitcoin Core 0.16.1 (18.06.15) | Particl Core 0.16.1.0 (18 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 (18.02.26) | Particl Core 0.16.0.1 (28 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.1 (17.11.11) | Particl Core 0.15.1 (6 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 (17.09.19) | Particl Core 0.15.0.2 (10 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 (17.09.14) | Merged with above (15 days later)\n\nNeedless to say, copy-pasta [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta] project\nteams don’t care about this level of security or compatibility with Bitcoin and\n99.9% of projects can’t make the above claim over the past year.\n\n*Bitcoin Core 0.16.2 is already in the pipeline: 0.16.2rc2\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.16.2rc2] | Particl Core is\nstaying in step: master_btc\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/bd0445c306e0aa0a4bc13023b6149f3d00d65fca]\n\nParticl Roadmap\nWe released our current roadmap\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-roadmap-update-891d898ad47b] in March\nand the progress of development can be seen on our website\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/].\n\nIf you watch our AMA livestreams every couple weeks you hopefully caught our\nlast one with Ryno joining me to talk development and the marketplace\n[https://youtu.be/Xtmc2qCWmvc]. He mentioned in that episode we would be looking\nat our scrum/sprint platform plan to see if we can open the scheduling and\nprogress wireframes up to public viewing in an effort to be more transparent.\nThat will be something to keep an eye out for for those who want to get more\ndetails on Particl R&D.\n\nAll our roadmap items are highly anticipatory because they directly tie to\nfuture products on Particl’s first-of-its-kind privacy platform. One item that\nis personally exciting to me is the Particl Open Market Protocol (OMP) that \nKewde [https://github.com/kewde] is working on. A library\n[https://github.com/particl/omp-lib] for the OMP has begun on Github that is\ntied to the Software Development Kit (SDK)\n\nParticl Network\nParticl is a testing environment by nature and all of our development is open\nsource and runs through multiple levels of testing and refinement. We don’t\nclose source our Desktop [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop] GUI or our \nMarket [https://github.com/particl/particl-market] backend. Every piece of our\nprivacy platform is out in the open.\n\nParticl has maintained 2 active and functioning blockchains since our mainnet\ngenesis block was generated; which all our products and applications run on in\nvarious level of development and deployment. Our Mainnet chain is what most\npeople use to send and receive PART. Our Testnet chain is our research and\ndevelopment environment where new privacy features and security technology is\ncreated.\n\nMainnet\nThe first and only live version of Confidential Transactions (CT) on a Bitcoin\nbased blockchain has been on Particl’s mainnet since launch day 1 last year. We\nalso have the first and only cold storage staking protocol\n[https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac] on the main\nchain — no matter what others may say\n[https://www.coindesk.com/a-3-3-billion-claim-has-cardanos-blockchain-solved-proof-of-stake/] \n?.\n\nParticl was one of the first projects to have Native Segwit as well, meaning,\nevery transaction on Particl is a fast, low-cost, Segwit transaction.\n\nSecure Messages can be sent using our cli/Qt Core wallet builds\n[http://particl.io/downloads/]. Particl Copay and Particl Desktop are 2 more\nofficial mobile and desktop clients (respectively) running on mainnet.\n\n> We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that\nworks. — Douglas Adams\nParticl Desktop\nI find this quote fitting for our flagship client, Particl Desktop.

There is no denying the level of care\nthe CRZ [https://github.com/gerlofvanek] and xludx [https://github.com/xludx] \nlead teams have placed on usability, design and simplicity within the entire\nline of Particl products/apps.\n\nMost crypto project teams can create pretty pictures of what they plan to make\nand what they want to deliver, but very, very few can actually show you a well\ndesigned working app or even prototype until they’ve cycled through 12 to 24\nmonths of funding.\n\nDesktop is one example of what Particl developers roadmap to build\n\nHere is what the Particl team delivered\n\nTestnet\nParticl testnet currently has the only working version of RingCT\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] on a Bitcoin based codebase in\nexistence. This is a really big deal, even bigger than Particl also having the\nonly version of CT live on mainnet. RingCT is a very intense and complex privacy\nenhancement the Particl team implemented on our codebase and, as such, we went\nto great lengths to properly review and audit our design. Read more about the\nstatus of those reports further down the article.\n\nParticl Marketplace (ALPHA)\nOf course the biggest news for Particl this year has been the release of our MVP\n[https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509]\n, Particl Marketplace. Our Alpha version of the marketplace is live on our\ntestnet. We have an active community of testers debugging it and our team is\noccasionally placing real Particl swag on the decentralized marketplace for\nusers to get a real experience of the early buying process the private\nmarketplace will offer; including our 2-party trustless escrow (MAD) protocol.\n\n> \nAlpha is a privacy-focused decentralized shopping app within Particl Desktop.\nUsers can download a testnet only version of Desktop that comes with Alpha\nMarketplace pre-loaded.\n\nRate of Coin Supply Reduced\nThe days of PART coin supply increasing 5% over the first year are now over.\nToday at 2018–07–17 13:00:00 the inflation rate of PART coin supply decreased\n1%. By design, this inflation model is coded to move from 5% the first year to\n2% the fourth year and every year thereafter.\n\nThe nodes working on the Particl network providing consensus will now receive a\n4% coinstake reward for the next year.\n\nThe historic first 4% block staked: \nhttps://explorer.particl.io/block/cc50daf0bee9e64d413a17df4b19046715c5f389b1a881c6976960c1dc615f84\n\nAudits and Peer Reviews\nDPRating [https://medium.com/u/b9f607dd798]\n\nDarpal Ratings is a blockchain auditing company focused on the digital currency\nsector.

Per our last Community Update, we have a 6 month grant\nestablished with NJIT for a RingCT peer review that just completed. We also\nhired WSA to perform a RingCT code audit that is only about 2 weeks of work.\n\nNJIT Peer Review\nOur team has a copy of Professor Qiang’s paper on Particl’s Ring Confidential\nTransactions and are reviewing it in-house and with his research team.\nUltimately Prof. Qiang has asked if they can submit the paper as an academic\nresearch paper for review among trade publications and peers. The team would\nfully support a submission after proper dialog between both teams is completed.\n\nWSA Code Audit\nA couple weeks ago we engaged WSA for a RingCT code audit. Ryno\n[https://github.com/rynomster] got word that the review is done and only 4 minor\nissues were found, nothing major or critical! The WSA team hinted that the\nreport would be delivered this week so we’ll keep everyone in the loop.\n\nClosing Remarks\n> The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the\nart. — John Lasseter\nThis quote rings true for every Pixar or Disney movie ever made. It’s easy to\nsee beauty at the end of a project and it takes a trained eye to see it during\nthe product’s lifecycle.\n\nParticl isn’t out to unseed Bitcoin as the one and only digital currency or\nAmazon as the only place to buy stuff online.

He mentioned in that episode we would be looking at our scrum/sprint platform plan to see if we can open the scheduling and progress wireframes up to public viewing in an effort to be more transparent. That will be something to keep an eye out for for those who want to get more details on Particl R&#x26;D.</p><p>All our roadmap items are highly anticipatory because they directly tie to future products on Particl’s first-of-its-kind privacy platform. One item that is personally exciting to me is the <strong>Particl Open Market Protocol (OMP)</strong> that <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde\">Kewde</a> is working on. A <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/omp-lib\">library</a> for the OMP has begun on Github that is tied to the <strong>Software Development Kit (SDK)</strong></p><h2 id=\"particl-network\">Particl Network</h2><p>Particl is a testing environment by nature and all of our development is open source and runs through multiple levels of testing and refinement. We don’t close source our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop\">Desktop</a> GUI or our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">Market</a> backend. Every piece of our privacy platform is out in the open.</p><p>Particl has maintained 2 active and functioning blockchains since our mainnet genesis block was generated; which all our products and applications run on in various level of development and deployment. Our Mainnet chain is what most people use to send and receive PART. Our Testnet chain is our research and development environment where new privacy features and security technology is created.</p><h3 id=\"mainnet\">Mainnet</h3><p>The first and only live version of <strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong> on a Bitcoin based blockchain has been on Particl’s mainnet since launch day 1 last year. We also have the first and only <a href=\"https://particl.news/primer-cold-staking-on-particl-98adbd4a0cac\">cold storage staking protocol</a> on the main chain — no matter what others may <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/a-3-3-billion-claim-has-cardanos-blockchain-solved-proof-of-stake/\">say</a> ?.</p><p>Particl was one of the first projects to have Native Segwit as well, meaning, every transaction on Particl is a fast, low-cost, Segwit transaction.</p><p>Secure Messages can be sent using our cli/Qt Core wallet <a href=\"http://particl.io/downloads/\">builds</a>. <strong>Particl Copay</strong> and <strong>Particl Desktop</strong> are 2 more official mobile and desktop clients (respectively) running on mainnet.</p><blockquote>We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works. — Douglas Adams</blockquote><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h3><p>I find this quote fitting for our flagship client, Particl Desktop. Mainstream adoption for cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications isn’t going to come down to how much is “under the hood”. Ultimately, widespread adoption will come down to how easy this or that is to use. There is no denying the level of care the <a href=\"https://github.com/gerlofvanek\">CRZ</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/xludx\">xludx</a> lead teams have placed on usability, design and simplicity within the entire line of Particl products/apps.</p><p>Most crypto project teams can create pretty pictures of what they plan to make and what they want to deliver, but very, very few can actually show you a well designed working app or even prototype until they’ve cycled through 12 to 24 months of funding.</p><p><strong>Desktop is one example of what Particl developers roadmap to build</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Genesis-Anniversary/0-0NNCK9M8KjA7CLmo.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><strong>Here is what the Particl team delivered</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Genesis-Anniversary/1-WMbgixnNqgWXAQFeuhyiaw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"testnet\">Testnet</h3><p>Particl testnet currently has the only working version of <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> on a Bitcoin based codebase in existence. <strong>This is a really big deal</strong>, even bigger than Particl also having the only version of CT live on mainnet. RingCT is a very intense and complex privacy enhancement the Particl team implemented on our codebase and, as such, we went to great lengths to properly review and audit our design. Read more about the status of those reports further down the article.</p><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace-alpha-\">Particl Marketplace (ALPHA)</h3><p>Of course the biggest news for Particl this year has been the release of our <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-marketplace-alpha-released-and-available-for-testing-3240739f7509\">MVP</a>, <strong>Particl Marketplace. </strong>Our Alpha version of the marketplace is live on our testnet. We have an active community of testers debugging it and our team is occasionally placing real Particl swag on the decentralized marketplace for users to get a real experience of the early buying process the private marketplace will offer; including our 2-party trustless escrow (MAD) protocol.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Alpha is a privacy-focused decentralized shopping app within Particl Desktop.

We’ve got your back with our\nbi-weekly community and project update!\n\nThanks to our community member CryptoBeans for preparing most of the notes for\nthis update!\n\nLivestream Summary\nTeam Meetings\nTaking a break at the end of the day!Most of the core Particl developers met in\nPrague during the last week of June for a series of project meetings focused on\nthe planning and development of the roadmap items for the second half of the\nyear and moving forward. A particular focus was put on both the project and\nmarketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet\nfeature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed\nduring that time.\n\nTo conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer,\njoined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as\nan update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from\nthe community.\n\nProject & Marketplace Governance\nRyno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going\nto be integrated into the platform.\n\n * The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the\n   marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.\n * The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin\n   with and will evolve with time.\n * Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the\n   wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.\n * The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting\n   as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much\n   smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.\n * When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by\n   the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients\n   connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.\n * Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing\n   is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is\n   blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the\n   blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s\n   side.\n * When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the\n   vendor.\n * Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not\n   necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be.\n   The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the\n   governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace\n   governance model is planned for the Beta.\n * Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that\n   users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same\n   listing again.\n\nRingCT\nThere have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under\nacademic review for the last 6 months by assistant-professor Qiang Tang from\nthe\nNJIT Department of Technology [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/].\n\n * The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy\n   protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.\n * Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in\n   possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will\n   soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be\n   made available at that point.\n * The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their\n   research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nWeSecureApp * The WSA Cyber Group [https://wesecureapp.com/#] will then perform a full\n   RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the\n   RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require\n   around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline,\n   only a rough estimate.\n * While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &\n   CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet\n   implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not\n   only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still\n   very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe\n   there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be\n   considered safe enough for our users.\n\nMarketplace\nAs the Particl Marketplace Alpha\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] is still being improved\nand tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as\nwell as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.\n\n * Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion\n   on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be\n   added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the\n   messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to\n   store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli\n   but is not available in a graphical interface.\n * As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make\n   available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the designs from\n   our t-shirt contest winners\n   [https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5], to the\n   Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!\n * Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden\n   marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into\n   Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the\n   marketplace.\n * The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern\n   private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into\n   the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire\n   marketplaces (TBC).\n\nParticl Foundation\nDuring the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a\nParticl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course\nattended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions\nrelated to the Foundation.\n\n * The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second\n   or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the Particl\n   Foundation website [http://particl.foundation/financial-reports].\n * The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is\n   planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in\n   September 2018.\n\nLedger\nAs part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger\nwallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as\nwell as some other coins.\n\n * It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART,\n   however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for\n   advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s\n   interface.\n * Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.\n   [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482] \n   The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.\n * The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public\n   transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is\n   part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.\n\nOther Questions Asked During the Livestream\nThere are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community\nto both Ryno and Paul.\n\nRyno answering some of the Particl community questions * When asked where he\n   sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the\n   marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to\n   developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of\n   users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the\n   marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly\n   communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized\n   eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number,\n   talent, and experience.\n * When asked about other\n   dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is\n   in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated\n   about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally\n   enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny\n   auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.\n * Within the Particl\n   community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish\n   list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good\n   ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps,\n   gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (with one streaming dApp\n   allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member\n   [https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA]), and etc. One thing is for sure; the\n   idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to\n   dramatically improve several industries.\n * Ryno was asked about\n   the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of\n   the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts\n   of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as\n   the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is\n   now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl\n   developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile\n   methodologies are now also being put into practice, and two new development\n   managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired\n   [https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5]. It\n   was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for\n   issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are\n   now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s status\n   reports [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nBi-Weekly Recap\nThere is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have\nbeen quite eventful for the project.\n\nParticl Team is Expanding\nOn the 27th of June, we introduced 6 new team members\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5] \nincluding three managers and three developers. Carmen and Vivienne, our two new\ndevelopment managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our\norganizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new\ndevelopers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to\nspeed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!\n\nDuring last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer\nfor Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year.\nThis developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included\nin the 6 new team members blog post.\n\nPartaker Hub\nTop 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.The Partaker\nHub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of\ncontributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub\nis now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that it\nwas\nlaunched only three weeks ago\n[https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4].\n\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in\nspreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout\nto encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of\n146 tasks.\n\nDuring these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience\nfor all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and\nexperimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl\nmessage through organic word-of-mouth.\n\nAs such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be\nlinked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that\nusing and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the\nresults of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our\ncommunity to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more\ndetails about these new developments should be coming out soon.\n\nCommunity Meetup\nFollowing the week of meetings, the Particl team held a meetup\n[https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de] for\ncommunity members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks.\nThe meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague\nthat only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of\nour fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts)\nfrom TShirtPrinting [http://tshirtprinting.gr/], a long-time supporter of the\nproject, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and\noffering them as gifts!\n\nNew Particl Core Update\nYesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version\n(0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of\nalways staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase\nand is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience\nfor our users.\n\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will,\nhowever, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or\nParticl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core\nbut will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update\ncan be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract.\nNot updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but\nit is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl\nCore for security and stability reasons.\n\nNote that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will\nautomatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a\nversion before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.\n\nNew Official Blog Posts\nThere has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two\nweeks!\n\n * First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!\n   [https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441]\n * Particl welcomes 6 new team members!\n   [https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5]\n * Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub\n   [https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66]\n * PART now available for swapping on Mycelium\n   [https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a]\n * RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0\n   [https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515]\n\nNew CryptoRamble Videos\nDesi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only\nParticl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

This developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included in the 6 new team members blog post.</p><h3 id=\"partaker-hub\">Partaker Hub</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-hk3ogNBwA1tDap_t2WDTDw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Top 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.</figcaption></figure><p>The Partaker Hub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of contributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub is now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4\">it was launched only three weeks ago</a>.</p><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in spreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout to encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of 146 tasks.</p><p>During these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience for all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and experimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl message through organic word-of-mouth.</p><p>As such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be linked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that using and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the results of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our community to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more details about these new developments should be coming out soon.</p><h3 id=\"community-meetup\">Community Meetup</h3><p>Following the week of meetings, the Particl team <a href=\"https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de\">held a meetup</a> for community members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks. The meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague that only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of our fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts) from <a href=\"http://tshirtprinting.gr/\">TShirtPrinting</a>, a long-time supporter of the project, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and offering them as gifts!</p><h3 id=\"new-particl-core-update\">New Particl Core Update</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-Z9ugBVnUoCv5Uo-7z4xHiw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Yesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version (0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of always staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase and is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience for our users.</p><p>If you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will, however, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or Particl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core but will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update can be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract. Not updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but it is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl Core for security and stability reasons.</p><p>Note that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will automatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a version before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.</p><h3 id=\"new-official-blog-posts\">New Official Blog Posts</h3><p>There has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two weeks!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441\">First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">Particl welcomes 6 new team members!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66\">Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a\">PART now available for swapping on Mycelium</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515\">RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"new-cryptoramble-videos\">New CryptoRamble Videos</h3><p>Desi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only Particl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

A particular focus was put on both the project and marketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet feature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed during that time.</p><p>To conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer, joined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as an update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from the community.</p><h3 id=\"project-marketplace-governance\">Project &#x26; Marketplace Governance</h3><p>Ryno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going to be integrated into the platform.</p><ul><li>The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.</li><li>The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin with and will evolve with time.</li><li>Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.</li><li>The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.</li><li>When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.</li><li>Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s side.</li><li>When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the vendor.</li><li>Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be. The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace governance model is planned for the Beta.</li><li>Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same listing again.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ringct\">RingCT</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-QeptxWMrevjZX2HigZVhhg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>There have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under academic review for the last 6 months by <a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/\">assistant-professor Qiang Tang from the NJIT Department of Technology</a>.</p><ul><li>The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.</li><li>Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be made available at that point.</li><li>The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-2AsxZ8uoxIj2CWNRb_p_Fw@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>WeSecureApp</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://wesecureapp.com/#\">WSA Cyber Group</a> will then perform a full RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline, only a rough estimate.</li><li>While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &#x26; CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be considered safe enough for our users.</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace\">Marketplace</h3><p>As the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Particl Marketplace Alpha</a> is still being improved and tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as well as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.</p><ul><li>Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli but is not available in a graphical interface.</li><li>As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5\">designs from our t-shirt contest winners</a>, to the Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!</li><li>Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the marketplace.</li><li>The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire marketplaces (TBC).</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-foundation\">Particl Foundation</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>During the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a Particl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course attended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions related to the Foundation.</p><ul><li>The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the <a href=\"http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\">Particl Foundation website</a>.</li><li>The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in September 2018.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ledger\">Ledger</h3><p>As part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger wallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as well as some other coins.</p><ul><li>It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART, however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s interface.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482\">Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.</a> The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.</li><li>The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.</li></ul><h3 id=\"other-questions-asked-during-the-livestream\">Other Questions Asked During the Livestream</h3><p>There are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community to both Ryno and Paul.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-rvUyAEMi_0RTxb8o3jg08g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Ryno answering some of the Particl community questions</figcaption></figure><ul><li>When asked where he sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number, talent, and experience.</li><li>When asked about other dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.</li><li>Within the Particl community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps, gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (<a href=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA\">with one streaming dApp allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member</a>), and etc. One thing is for sure; the idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to dramatically improve several industries.</li><li>Ryno was asked about the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile methodologies are now also being put into practice, and <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">two new development managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired</a>. It was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">status reports</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=\"bi-weekly-recap\">Bi-Weekly Recap</h2><p>There is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have been quite eventful for the project.</p><h3 id=\"particl-team-is-expanding\">Particl Team is Expanding</h3><p>On the 27th of June, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">we introduced 6 new team members</a> including three managers and three developers.
