we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, focusing on the various items contained in\nthe list below.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nRemember that, in the interest of pushing updates more quickly and as the array\nof dependency updates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development\ndebts of the past few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with\nmost of the updates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent\nupdate (i.e., 3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n> Note: Particl Desktop development is currently being worked on on a part-time\nbasis, which is expected to result in slower development pace compared to Core\nor BasicSwap DEX. However, we expect to resume development of this department on\na full-time capacity in the near future.\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Allow users to select which coins to show prices for on offers page\n? Move v13 from dev to master — not compatible with previous versions\n?

sovereignty has been a\ndriving force behind many blockchain projects, but few have come as close to\nrealizing this vision as the Particl Marketplace. \n\nWith its comprehensive ecosystem, Particl aims to create an all-inclusive and\ncircular economy where users can opt-out of the traditional financial system and\nlive completely free from middlemen. \n\nHowever, to achieve this level of independence, a robust and decentralized way\nto trade the platform's native currency, PART, is essential. This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
