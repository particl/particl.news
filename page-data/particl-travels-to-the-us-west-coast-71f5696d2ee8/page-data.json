As you probably already know, the team initiated its \nParticl World Tour [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] \nby first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —\nMoney2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], WCC [https://worldcryptocon.com/], and \nSFBW’s Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/].\n\nIt’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the\nteam has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a\nsignificant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new\nfriends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey!\nAlong the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds,\nbusiness owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a new\nadvisor [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329], Bryan\nWoods [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167] (Spend.com\n[https://spend.com]’s President) to assist and support the project in making the\nbest out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and\neCommerce industries. The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most\nof the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm that has grown\ncloser to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019.\nTheir insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have\nproven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.\n\nFor this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team split into different\ngroups and spread out on the US West Coast (San Francisco & Las Vegas) to cover\nmultiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of\nground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best\nleveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s\nEpicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet,\nin-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get\nthe most done out of it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSan Francisco\nWhile a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion\nwas already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week.\nEpicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two\ndays as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of\ninterest!\n\nThe city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted\nthe entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based\ncryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco\nand the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the\ntech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of\ncreating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very\nmuch within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.\n\nSFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the\nweek) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first\npoints of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events\nand evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two\ndays of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made\nduring the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with\nthese people.\n\nBefore Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain\nWeek’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a\nquick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As\nis now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and\ninterest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around,\nlike the stand-up guys over at Cracking Crypto\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto],\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto] for example.\n\nDr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto ShowThe team also attended\nmore than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?)\nall throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital,\nPantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and\nmore. The connections established at all these events really did set the state\nfor when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.\n\nLas Vegas\nAnd so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW,\nJoe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend Money2020\n[https://us.money2020.com/] and the World Crypto Conference (WCC)\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nParticl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New AdvisorAt Money2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], a Fintech conference focused on\ninnovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on sealing the\ndeal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com. Spend.com is a\nteam that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the\nConsensus 2019 booth in New York City.\n\nThe Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth (one of the big\nsponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into\n2020. This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier\nin October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com. Meeting once again, at Money2020,\nallowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term\nrelationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog\npost published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!\n\nSpecial shoutout to Nicholas Merten [https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten], aka \nDataDash [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw], which the\nteam had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication,\nand projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream\nadoption really impressed!\n\nNicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with ParticlThen, after Money2020,\nCryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher\nstayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the WCC conference\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nWCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been\nlooking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the\nfirst points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC\nattracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain\nindustry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting\nthe team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.\n\nJoe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event\nAnd then came Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/], the main event of the\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before\nand came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main\nentrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.\n\nParticl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s EpicenterJust like\nthroughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were\noverwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised\nthat a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live\nand looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has\nbeen receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.\n\nEpicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more\nfocused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to\nunderstand. The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than\ntwo-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true\npioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave. They are the people fighting\nin the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will\none day catch up on the mainstream level.\n\nAnd in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech\ninnovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences\ndon’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the\nlong-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that\nare making it happen.\n\nThis is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew\nthe potential of this local blockchain community, thanks in part to attending\nthe SF-based Bitcoin2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] \nconference earlier in the year, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and\nexcited crowd.\n\n, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research InstituteAnd the team\nwas right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with\nthought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many\nadvice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with \nDon Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute\n[https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/], and earn 30 minutes of his time\njust before flying out to Europe.\n\nIndeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs,\nand evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing\nblockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers,\nbusiness developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve\na Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the\nway that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.\n\nThe team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr.\nKap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended\nthe talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and\nintentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days\nby the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s\npresentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.\n\n> The upload originally is a Periscope\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] \n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB]video\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] taken by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. You can check out more video of the team in San\nFrancisco by browsing Ben’s Periscope uploads here: \nhttps://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1jMJgwZoNjWJL?t=1s\nThe team used the exposure and momentum provided by a full week of intensive\nnetworking to announce to major pieces of news that will help propel the project\nforward —an in-wallet integration of a Bitcoin exchange module\n[https://particl.news/particl-announces-bitcoin-exchange-integration-into-particl-desktop-e7c0940c0b4d] \nand the official beginning of an intimate and long-term relationship with\nSpend.com [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329]. Bryan\nWoods, Spend.com’s President, was announced at the same time as a new advisor to\nthe project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTakeaways\nThink of this whole US West Coast trip as a giant, never-ending brainstorming\nsession with not only team members, but advisors, leaders, and experts from many\ndifferent industries hungry to see any solid blockchain tech succeed.\n\nThe Particl Team Debriefing Post-SFBWThe people the team met get it. They get\nthe potential of blockchain and Particl both. They want to see the industry\nsucceed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday\npeople.\n\nWhile the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now\ncrystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its\nOpen Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other\nend-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive\npotential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people\nmet during this trip.\n\nBut getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more. \nThe best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by\nanyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and\noffers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new\nadoption-focused phase the project is headed to.\n\nThe team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside\nperspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will\nbe very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that\nadoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with\nthe best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do\nthis! ?\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThe development team has been focused on the next few items, as identified a\nwhile ago\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b]\n, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy\nconversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a\nfew features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users\nto the marketplace.\n\nIn the meantime, the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new\nphase to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for\nadoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin\nin the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the\npast two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the\nOpen Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot\ntowards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nIt is very clear, the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely\nmotivated and hungry for success. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts,\ndirectly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is\nreceptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this\nnow-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very\nmethodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nParticl Team After Epicenter’s ClosureAs you might start to understand simply by\nreading this post, this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives,\nchallenges, and goals for the project. Think of it as the “war room phase”, the\nmoment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.\n\nNext Locations of the Particl World Tour\nWith that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two\nadditional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.\n\nIndeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at Blockshow Asia\n[https://blockshow.com/], in Singapore, and Slush Helsinki\n[https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/], in Finland.\n\nAt Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s\nside-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first\npoints of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get\nas much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e] on\nParticl.news, Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax\nregulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with\ncryptocurrencies a tax-free event. It is a direct use-case for buying and\nselling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine\nbrightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream\nin Singapore…\n\nAt Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be\noperating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically\ngoing to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will\nconsist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead\nDesigner, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria\n(Particl’s Communications & Strategy Team).\n\nBoth these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and\nresources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t\nbe better!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou, Too, Can Be a Part of it!\nThe best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in\nthe space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their\nrelated side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are\nthe active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain\nrevolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there\nand attend your local blockchain events. Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and\nkicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators\nmore motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by\nthe “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be\nright in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole\nadded here ?).\n\nAfter all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just\none part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so\nmuch FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned for more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming\nThursday, the 14th of November. Then, on the 21st of November, Particl will be\nhaving another surprise announcement!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-fg-rxBVAgcC3I7WZpZR3dA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"recap-dr-kap-s-own-video-recap-of-the-events-\">Recap + Dr. Kap’s Own Video Recap of the Events ?</h3><p>The Particl team is finally back home from its US West Coast trip and hot damn was it an eventful week!

The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage.

This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &amp; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a> by first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —<a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong> Money2020</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>WCC</strong></a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB1yf5CaXHI\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a significant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new friends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey! Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019. Their insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have proven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXnJg_HTXI8?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this first part of the Particl World Tour, <strong>the team split into different groups and spread out on the US West Coast</strong> (San Francisco &#x26; Las Vegas) to cover multiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together.

What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &#x26; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

Initially mentioned\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] last Friday by\nDr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his 30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc], this new payment option will\nallow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace.\nThis news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this\nparticular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open\nMarketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part\nof the Particl community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Payment Integration\nHow the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate,\nstandalone BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop. The module will\ninteract with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part\nof the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a separate page within\nParticl Desktop.\n\nThe reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received\nPART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you\nprobably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be\nable to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a\npublic balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more\nconfirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations\n(incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently\nstands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a\nuser-friendly and practical way.\n\nExchange Module…as a Separate Page\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a\nsimple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl\nDesktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu\ncurrently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address\nBook. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section\nof the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet,\nmeaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.\n\nPutting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means\nBitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin,\nallowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to\nbe paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).\n\nExchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process\nWhile the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the\nforeseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and\ninteract with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of\npurchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart,\nconfirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on\nthe order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two\nbuttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the\nexchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the\n“Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will\nredirect you to the exchange module.\n\nOnce there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary\nto pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire\nthat many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange\nmodule and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be\nable to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and\nsuccessfully place your order.\n\nSo while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange\nmodule will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and\nuser-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThis BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of\ndecentralized exchange method, at least not for its initial integration.\nInstead, it will be plugged into a non-custodial exchange that doesn’t require\nKYC or personal information —SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)The module uses SMSG to relay messages between Particl and the\nSimpleSwap engine. The key part to understand is that this exchange module has\nbeen built using SMSG in a very generic matter, and it could eventually be used\nas the base layers to deploy all sorts of services on Particl (i.e. price\npegging, chat module, etc). This module is likely to be included in the incoming\nParticl SDK which is probably going to see the day somewhere in 2020.\n\nA “per transaction” limit function has also been integrated into the module as\nwell, making sure users exchange a number of coins that’s in between the minimum\nand maximum range allowed by the exchange. Most of the information that is\nusually displayed when making a transaction on [https://simpleswap.io/]\nSimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/] will also all be displayed right from\nParticl Desktop.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange module will also include an “auto-anonymizer” feature\nwhich will allow you to automatically receive your PART on anon balances. This\nadditional privacy feature included in Particl Desktop’s exchange module isn’t\navailable when simply going on [https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap\n[https://simpleswap.io/]’s website. That RingCT exchange perk feature may, or\nmay not, be part of the first iteration of the exchange module, but it is\nalready in development and should follow very shortly after the first release if\nnot immediately ready. Fingers crossed!\n\nFinally, the exchange module is not designed or hardcoded to work only using \n[https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/]. That particualr\nexchange was chosen as the initial service provider because of the lack of KYC\nrequirements and the relatively low friction involved in trades. Should new\nexchanges that provide similar benefits list PART, they could be added to the\nmodule, giving users even more options.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll About Adoption and Speed\nThis integration of a BTC-PART payment module is directly in line with the\nteam’s current focus on eliminating the barriers to entry and kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl network. It significantly increases the potential amount\nof users that can use the Particl ecosystem and makes getting PART as easy as it\nhas ever been.\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)While the feature itself is not entirely ready as of the time of\nthis writing, the team has completed the back-end code as well as the testing\nand is currently finalizing the GUI integration. That should be completed within\na few days, and then more testing will be required to make sure its integration\ninto Particl Desktop hasn’t highlighted any new issue. While a definitive\nrelease date cannot be committed to at this moment, we are getting pretty close\nfor the feature to be fully ready. The exchange module will be released as part\nof Particl Desktop 2.3.0.\n\nNote: Particl Desktop 2.2.0 is currently being tested on testnet and should be\nreleased within just a few days. Aside from the new Global Settings feature, it\nwill mostly include bug fixes, flow optimizations, and UI/UX improvements.\nParticl Desktop 2.2.0 and Particl Desktop 2.3.0 are estimated to be released in\nvery close proximity.\n\nThe Pieces are Falling Into Place\nThe Particl team is full steam ahead and working tirelessly on kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl platform. Stay alert as you can expect some exciting\nnews to be published soon on Particl.news. Suffice to say, the future of Particl\nis looking brighter every day as the pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall\ninto place at a very interesting pace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-kqXnceUmmgRlUGrFYGulPw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-SvvDdJMh8rUGGY0sr516iQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>Today we’re excited to officially announce more details about Particl’s integration of a Bitcoin exchange module into the Particl Desktop client.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
