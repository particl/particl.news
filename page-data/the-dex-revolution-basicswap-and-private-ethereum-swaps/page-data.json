Of course, being able to integrate the latter would\nimmediately make the integration of a number of stablecoins trivial, as many\nstablecoins already exist as ETH tokens.\n\nThese are some thoughts on what a PART(Anon)-ETH and XMR-ETH swap integration\ninto a comprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap could look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Existing XMR-ETH Swap\n\nPeople who had the pleasure to witness Elizabeth Bink [https://github.com/noot]\n’s Monerotopia presentation on XMR-ETH swaps may have developed a curiosity\ntowards hyper-private Ethereum swaps and what they entail, perhaps most\nimportantly in the hopes of facilitating untraceable, decentralized swaps\nbetween privacy coins and stablecoins (or simply ETH itself).\n\nElizabeth and the open source project AthanorLabs\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] achieved the first XMR-ETH atomic\nswap earlier this year, and presented it to the world at the Monerotopia\nconference in Mexico City, on May 6th. Using their own breakthrough protocol,\nAthanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring\nto the table, to achieve for the first time a bona fide atomic swap between the\ntwo currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations\nto integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap\nworks and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly\nmore interesting for our purposes.\n\nUnder The Hood\nXMR, of course, and as we’ve discussed at length\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic HTLC swap\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], where both coins need some\nbasic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.\n\nETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people\nfamiliar with the semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4] \nthat the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that\nthe “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nAs it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless\nadaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of\ntoday fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is\nthat Ethereum is account-based\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/], and not UTXO-based.\n\nThe Challenges of an Account-based Architecture\nIn short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to\ndecrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account\nbalance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based\ntransaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique nonce\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp]. To that end, the nonce is\npublicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that\nthe same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.\n\nThis breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires\nrefund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a\ntransaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could\nthen send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and\nwhen the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed\ntransaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).\n\nPre-signing in adaptor signature swapsAthanorLab's solution is to make use of\nEthereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the\nswap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless\n- but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the\nnecessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by\nthe powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC\n(where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than\nadaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the\nside without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other\ntransaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the\ntransaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even\nwith sophisticated chain analysis tools.\n\nSo, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal\nlogic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds —\nincluding Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both\ninadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a\nfull integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.\n\nA snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG networkCurrent\nProtocol Limitations\nAn important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is\nthat ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in.\nThat means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only\none side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. \n\nThe RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund\nin case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks\nfirst, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder\nlocks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked\nforever. This means that the swap itself always has to be structured in one way,\nwith XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at\nthe protocol level.\n\nAnother underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even\nadvertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the\nEthereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided\nfor by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another\nreason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder\nto lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could\neasily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or\nmultiple offers, and back out.\n\nThis unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's\nparameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective\nquantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have\nlittle say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the\npreferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. \n\nAthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interfaceLooking Ahead\nMuch like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, BasicSwap's intention is to leverage\nthe SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed\nXMR-ETH swap protocol.\n\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nRemember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps\ndidn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic\nswap protocol. Instead, we leveraged the SMSG network to simulate offers\nfeaturing Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless protocol — hence,\nat the protocol level, the swap remains unidirectional. However, by integrating\nan additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network\n— we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround, essentially providing the \nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap, it is entirely seamless for the end user\nand doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nThis is all very exciting — the presence of ETH tokens would certainly prove a\npowerful addition to the BasicSwap ecosystem, and eventually to the Particl\nMarketplace, as it would open decentralized commerce to the entire Ethereum\necosystem. Furthermore, although a lot of work and testing are still ahead\nbefore this becomes a reality, the unique interaction of atomic swaps and\nBasicSwap's decentralized orderbook could once again prove to be key in\nachieving bidirectional swaps for a semi-scriptless protocol with substantial\nlimitations.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you wish to look into the ETH-XMR Atomic Swap protocol in more technical\ndetail, you can check out the project's Github\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap]\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] or join their Element room\n[https://matrix.to/#/#ethxmrswap:matrix.org]. \n\nThe protocol is still in its early phases, having been out to the public for\nslightly more than 3 months, and they would certainly welcome knowledgeable beta\ntesters and people willing to contribute end relays to this ongoing experiment!\nThe project is open source and at the forefront of atomic swap technology, and\nevery little bit helps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their\nhistory, make sure to give these articles a read!\n\n * Atomic Swap Style Showdown [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 2\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

It could seem to people familiar with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4\">semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol</a> that the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that the “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as always, the devil is in the details.</p><p>As it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless adaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of today fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is that Ethereum is <strong><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/\">account-based</a>,</strong> and not UTXO-based.</p><h3 id=\"the-challenges-of-an-account-based-architecture\">The Challenges of an Account-based Architecture</h3><p>In short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to decrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account balance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based transaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp\">nonce</a>. To that end, the nonce is publicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that the same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.</p><p>This breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires refund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a transaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could then send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and when the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed transaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QKqxfInsv6MoLt4G8DYAoCb0HYjFjci3sschANKgkLhq-6U4UyxOUNaC-xraWSls-jEZgGP1wZXpS3gHDtXtQM10K0KGfaHUdjGzFHXRxnBSaAA0e8gOcAjZe8wEKWz7rEYkLCOrsrsmmupTk7-O4k8\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Pre-signing in adaptor signature swaps</em></figcaption></figure><p>AthanorLab's solution is to make use of Ethereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the swap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless - but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the necessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by the powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.</p><p>Privacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC (where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than adaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the side without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other transaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the transaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even with sophisticated chain analysis tools.</p><p>So, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal logic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds — including Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both inadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a full integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-13.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-13.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-13.png 1394w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em>A snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG network</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"current-protocol-limitations\">Current Protocol Limitations</h3><p>An important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is that ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in. That means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only one side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. </p><p>The RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund in case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks first, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder locks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked forever. This means that <strong>the swap itself always has to be structured in one way</strong>, with XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at the protocol level.</p><p>Another underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even advertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the Ethereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided for by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another reason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder to lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could easily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or multiple offers, and back out.</p><p>This unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have little say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the preferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-9.png 600w, /glink/2023/08/image-9.png 981w\"><figcaption><em>AthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interface</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking Ahead</h2><p>Much like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, <strong>BasicSwap's intention is to leverage the SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed XMR-ETH swap protocol</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Cangrejo</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/18420229ea02ad69f34759df50d149e3/bidireciton_medium.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>Remember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps didn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, <a href=\"https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/\">we leveraged the SMSG network to <em>simulate </em>offers featuring Monero</a>. In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless protocol — hence, at the protocol level, the swap remains unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround, essentially providing the <em>illusion </em>of a truly bidirectional swap, it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>This is all very exciting — the presence of ETH tokens would certainly prove a powerful addition to the BasicSwap ecosystem, and eventually to the Particl Marketplace, as it would open decentralized commerce to the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

Due to changes in the data structure of\nBasicSwap-related SMSG messages, previous instances of the DEX are not\nforward-compatible with this new version. This means that offers posted from\nupdated instances will not appear on older instances. All users must update to\nmaintain full network connectivity.\nAfter 171 commits over 164 files changed coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4], we are\nexcited to announce the release of a significant BasicSwap update (v0.14.4)\nalong with an update to its user interface, now at version 3.2.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, new features, and significant refactors of\ndifferent core components of the system. The changes stem from extensive testing\nby both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step\nforward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nNoteworthy Updates ?\nWhile this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to\nimprove efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several\nsignificant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.\n\nVarious Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX.\nWhether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we\nhighly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.\n\nSignificant UI Refactor ?️\nA major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple\nof weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better\npractices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented\nnumerous UI upgrades, including:\n\n * Local reputation tracking\n * Enhanced order book formatting with additional information\n * New Bids page\n * Improved Swaps in Progress page\n * Better Offer pages\n * More responsive and dynamic page behavior\n * Better rate fetching\n * Much more...\n\nThe interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and\nyou'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.\n\nClient Authentication ?\nWe've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client\nauthentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a\npassword of your choosing. \n\nThis is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the\nmarket-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely\ntrust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation\ndocumentation.\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWe've pushed to master the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support\nfor BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure\nupdate to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called\n\"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages\nacross multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network\nexperiences high load.\n\nSince all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even\nnon-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without\ncompromising user privacy or security.\n\nThis new functionality delivers several key benefits:\n\n 1. Improved platform scalability and resilience\n 2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use\n    their preferred compatible networks for message relay\n 3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to\n    operate on the same network during swaps\n\nWhile the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before\nthe implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using\nSimplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific\nrecipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.\n\nThe core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various\nnetworks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency,\nalthough additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG\nmessages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting\npre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through\nP2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex\nnetworks.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its\nflexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be)\nfully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like\nTelegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols\nare particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth\nnoting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some\ninformation pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each\nother.\n\nAcceptance Strategy Knowledge ?\nWhen publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest\nof the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to\nautomatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page\nbefore submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which\noffers to bid on.\n\nPlease note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be\nable to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your\nBasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However,\noffer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so\nupgrading now carries no downside.\n\nDocs ?️\nWe've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses\nReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at \ndocs.basicswapdex.com [https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/]. While we'll\nmaintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates\nwill be provided at the new location.\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\nDue to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related\nmessages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in\nyour instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.\n\nTo install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface\nupdates, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/user-guides/update] (video walkthrough\n[https://youtu.be/obxcmEby64s?si=-kFNfEIJx8yQYJhP]) and launch the DEX again.\n\nDocker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image (docker-compose stop),\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build --no-cache command,\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\n> Note: Depending on your Docker version, adding a dash between docker and compose \nmay not be necessary and may instead throw an error.\nNon-Docker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the non-Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly,\n * From the ~/coinswaps/basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * Execute the following command: pip install --require-hashes -r\n   requirements.txt,\n * Execute the following command: pip3 install .,\n * Launch BasicSwap as usual.\n\nInstall Script\n> If you've installed BasicSwap using Nahuhh's Github installation script\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/]...\n * Execute the update command: bsx-update && bsx-update.\n\nChangelog ?\nCoin(s)\n * Bitcoin — Added support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets\n * Bitcoin — Update Bitcoins' fast sync blockchain file\n * Bitcoin — Add a workaround to prevent Bitcoin wallets' seeds changing after\n   enabling encryption\n * Bitcoin Cash — Upgraded Bitcoin Cash node to version 28.0.1\n * Bitcoin Cash — Refresh BCH keypool\n * Monero — Upgrade Monero node to version 0.18.4.0\n * Monero — Corrupt Monero wallets are now detected\n * Monero — Remove inaccurate fee rates for Monero and hide sweep all checkbox\n * Monero — Make Monero's fork height a transient error\n * Monero — Sets Monero's trusted_daemon setting to true by default\n * Litecoin — Fixed a bug with MWEB wallet generation\n * PIVX — Fixed issues with PIVX\n * Namecoin — Large array of fixes and improvements to the Namecoin integration\n * Wownero — Fixed Wownero's Windows download URL\n * Fixed a reseed wallet regression error\n\nAPI\n * Better handling of errors with the API\n * Fixed bug with Firo's API\n * Simplified API requests\n * Identities API updated\n * Use CryptoCompare pricemulti endpoint for multiple coins\n * Reduced lookupFiatRates debug message\n\nUI Code\n * Fixed various memory leaks and improved memory efficiency\n * Major UI refactor;

The changes stem from extensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step forward for user experience and platform stability.</p><h2 id=\"noteworthy-updates-\">Noteworthy Updates ?</h2><p>While this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to improve efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several significant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.</p><h3 id=\"various-coin-core-updates-\">Various Coin Core Updates ✅</h3><p>We've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX. Whether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we highly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.</p><h3 id=\"significant-ui-refactor-\">Significant UI Refactor ?️</h3><p>A major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple of weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better practices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented numerous UI upgrades, including:</p><ul><li>Local reputation tracking</li><li>Enhanced order book formatting with additional information</li><li>New Bids page</li><li>Improved Swaps in Progress page</li><li>Better Offer pages</li><li>More responsive and dynamic page behavior</li><li>Better rate fetching</li><li>Much more...</li></ul><p>The interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and you'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.</p><h3 id=\"client-authentication-\">Client Authentication ?</h3><p>We've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client authentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a password of your choosing. </p><p>This is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the market-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely trust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation documentation.</p><h3 id=\"multi-net-support-\">Multi-Net Support ?</h3><p>We've pushed to <code class=\"language-text\">master</code> the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support for BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure update to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called \"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.</p><p>Since all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even non-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without compromising user privacy or security.</p><p>This new functionality delivers several key benefits:</p><ol><li>Improved platform scalability and resilience</li><li>Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use their preferred compatible networks for message relay</li><li>Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to operate on the same network during swaps</li></ol><p>While the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before the implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using Simplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific recipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.</p><p>The core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various networks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency, although additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG messages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting pre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through P2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex networks.</p><p>Not to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its flexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be) fully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like Telegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols are particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth noting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some information pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each other.</p><h3 id=\"acceptance-strategy-knowledge-\">Acceptance Strategy Knowledge ?</h3><p>When publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest of the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to automatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page before submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which offers to bid on.</p><p>Please note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be able to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your BasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However, offer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so upgrading now carries no downside.</p><h3 id=\"docs-\">Docs ?️</h3><p>We've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses ReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at <a href=\"https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/\">docs.basicswapdex.com</a>. While we'll maintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates will be provided at the new location.</p><h2 id=\"install-the-latest-basicswap-update-\">Install the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️</h2><p>Due to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related messages, it is mandatory to update the DEX.
